abstract: 'Background: Heart failure (HF) is common and is associated with high mortality.
  We aimed to determine associations of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D (25[OH]D) with incident HF and left ventricular mass.Methods and Results: Among
  6459 participants in the community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis,
  all of whom were free of prevalent clinical cardiovascular disease, we measured
  serum concentrations of PTH and 25(OH)D at the baseline examination. In longitudinal
  analyses, we tested associations of PTH and 25(OH)D with incident HF events, adjudicated
  by a panel of physicians. In cross-sectional analyses of a subset of 4763 participants,
  we tested associations of PTH and 25(OH)D with left ventricular mass, measured by
  cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard
  and linear regression models were adjusted for demographics, physical examination
  measures, comorbidity, kidney function, and other mineral metabolism markers. Mean
  age was 62 years and 53% of participants were female. There were 180 incident HF
  events over a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 8.46 (7.67 to 8.63)
  years. Compared with participants with PTH textless65 pg/mL, PTH ≥65 pg/mL was associated
  with a 50% greater risk of incident HF (95% CI: 3% to 210%) and a 5.3 g higher left
  ventricular mass (95% CI: 2.6, 7.9 g). In contrast, there was no association of
  25(OH)D with risk of incident HF or elevated left ventricular mass.Conclusions:
  In a racially/ethnically diverse population without prevalent cardiovascular disease,
  higher serum PTH concentration was associated with increased left ventricular mass
  and increased risk of incident HF. Further studies should be pursued to determine
  whether PTH excess may be a modifiable risk factor for HF.'
