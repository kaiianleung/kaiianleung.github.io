abstract: To achieve health for all, the development of partnerships between community
  residents and researchers is essential. Community-based participatory research (CBPR)
  engages community members, uses local knowledge in the understanding of health problems
  and the design of interventions, and invests community members in the processes
  and products of research. CBPR pivots on an iterative process of open communication,
  mutual respect, and power sharing to build community capacity to sustain effective
  health interventions. This article describes how the tenets of CBPR were applied
  by a multidisciplinary, international research team of maternal-child health specialists
  toward better health for women and children in multilingual, multiethnic, low socioeconomic
  communities in Karachi, Pakistan. Â© 2009 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.
