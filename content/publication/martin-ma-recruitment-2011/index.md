abstract: 'Objective: Effective behavioral diabetes interventions for Mexican Americans
  are needed. Our study focused on efforts to recruit Mexican American adults for
  a trial testing a diabetes community health worker (CHW) self-management intervention.
  Design(s): Behavioral randomized controlled trial, community-based participatory
  research approach. Setting(s): Chicago. Participant(s): Mexican American adults
  with type 2 diabetes. Outcome Measures: Screening and randomization. Method(s):
  Initial eligibility criteria included Mexican heritage, treatment with oral diabetes
  medication, residence in designated zip codes, planned residence in the area for
  two years, and enrollment in a specific insurance plan. Result(s): Recruitment through
  the insurer resulted in only one randomized participant. Eligibility criteria were
  relaxed and subsequent efforts included bilingual advertisements, presentations
  at churches and community events, postings in clinics, partnerships with community
  providers, and CHW outreach. Zip codes were expanded multiple times and insurance
  criteria removed. CHW outreach resulted in 53% of randomized participants. Conclusion(s):
  Despite strong ties with the target community, culturally appropriate recruitment
  strategies involving community representation, and a large pool of potential participants,
  significant challenges were encountered in recruitment for this diabetes intervention
  trial. Researchers identified three key barriers to participation: study intensity
  and duration, lack of financial incentives, and challenges in establishing trust.
  For future research to be successful, investigators need to recognize these barriers,
  offer adequate incentives to compensate for intervention intensity, and establish
  strong trust through community partnerships and the incorporation of community members
  in the recruitment process.'
