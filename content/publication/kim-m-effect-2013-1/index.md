abstract: "Background: Great strides have been made in improving the nation's heart
  health during the last two decades, health disparities still exist within many ethnic
  minority populations. These individuals often suffer from insufficient health literacy,
  which severely limits their ability to make appropriate health decisions. In particular,
  as a member of first generation immigrant groups, Korean American seniors (KAS)
  with chronic disease such as hypertension encounter very stiff language and cultural
  barriers to accessing the complicated U.S health care system and have only limited
  personal resources. Purposes/ methods: To address this unmet health need of this
  underserved group, we designed a community-based clinical trial to test the efficacy
  of a comprehensive HBP management program that focused on health literacy among
  Korean American senior (KAS). The health literacy self-help intervention program
  for HBP (HL-SHIP-HBP) was a community-based, prospective controlled trial targeting
  KAS with hypertension in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Using an adaptive
  stratified randomization method, we selected a total of 22 ethnic Korean churches
  and senior centers in the region for use as study sites on the basis of their size
  and location, then randomly assigned each of them as either an intervention group
  site or control group site. Eligible members from each site were then screened and
  enrolled in the study. Eligibility criteria: Participants were Korean Americans
  60 years of age or older, with systolic BP (SBP) textgreater 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic
  BP (DBP) textgreater 90 mm Hg on two separate measurements or on antihypertensive
  medication. Result(s): A total of 369 KAS (mean age, 70.9 +/- 5.3 years) completed
  the program: 184 in the intervention and 185 in the control group. Main outcomes
  were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The findings indicate that the
  program (HL-SHIP-HBP) was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic
  minority population. The BP control rates of the intervention and control groups
  were 49.5% vs. 43.2% at baseline, 58.5% vs. 42.4% at 6 months, 67.9 vs. 52.5 at
  12 months, and 54.3% vs. 53.0% at 18 months. The potential contribution of health
  literacy to the long-term sustainability of HBP control will be discussed."
