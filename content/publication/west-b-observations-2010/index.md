abstract: 'Purpose Community-based diabetes screening is common, but its impact on
  health outcomes is unclear. Screening protocols may not be standardized nor reflect
  current clinical practice. A community and clinical team examined the quality and
  consistency of community-based screening to diagnose hyperglycemic states, and it
  developed a bilingual screening tool to allow screeners to present accurate, actionable
  results to participants. Methods The team interviewed providers and community members,
  analyzed forms and educational materials utilized by screeners, and observed local
  diabetes screening events. Researchers compared glucose parameters used by screeners
  to published guidelines and observed finger-stick techniques and protocols for education,
  referral, and follow-up. Screening was divided into 3 phases: participant assessment
  before testing, obtainment of a sample, and interpretation of and counsel about
  results. Results There was a general lack of consistency in diabetes screening practices
  at the 12 screenings attended and among the 11 screeners interviewed. Assessment
  rarely included evaluation of diabetes risk factors or recent caloric intake. Obtaining
  a sample through fingersticks often included practices known to cause discomfort
  and decrease accuracy of glucose measurements. Criteria used to categorize results
  as \"normal\"or \"abnormala\" rarely followed published guidelines for laboratory-measured
  glucose values and varied significantly between screeners. No organization mentioned
  prediabetes in screenings. Postscreening consultation protocols varied widely. Conclusions
  Inconsistencies and inaccuracies in screening practices may limit the quality and
  relevance of community-based diabetes screenings. The impact of local screenings
  may be enhanced by using a tool that includes concrete steps and precise guidelines.
