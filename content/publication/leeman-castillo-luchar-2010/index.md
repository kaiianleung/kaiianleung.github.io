abstract: Many promising technology-based programs designed to promote healthy behaviors
  such as physical activity and healthy eating have not been adapted for use with
  diverse communities, including Latino communities. We designed a community-based
  health kiosk program for English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos. Users receive personalized
  feedback on nutrition, physical activity, and smoking behaviors from computerized
  role models that guide them in establishing goals in 1 or more of these 3 areas.
  We found significant improvements in nutrition and physical activity among 245 Latino
  program users; however, no changes were observed with respect to smoking behaviors.
  The program shows promise for extending the reach of chronic disease prevention
  and self-management programs.
