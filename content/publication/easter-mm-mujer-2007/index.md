abstract: Latina women are a growing percentage of the working population, and very
  little is known about their health needs and interests. The purpose of this article
  is to share qualitative research results gathered from Latina women with a particular
  focus on exploring stress and health. This project was a substudy of Health Works
  in the Community, a 5-year CDC-funded multiple risk-factor reduction trial using
  participatory action research approaches to address smoking, healthy eating, stress,
  and physical activity among blue-collar women from 12 manufacturing work sites in
  rural, eastern North Carolina. Five focus groups were conducted with trained, bilingual
  facilitators using a vignette-based moderator guide that appeared particularly effective
  with this population. Results from the focus groups are used to make recommendations
  for future research with Latinas and for developing effective work-site-based interventions
  to address issues of stress and health within this population.
