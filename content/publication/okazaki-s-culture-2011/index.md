abstract: "In response to a call to better integrate culture in community psychology
  (O'Donnell in American Journal of Community Psychology 37:1-7 2006), we offer a
  cultural-community framework to facilitate a collaborative engagement between community
  psychologists and ethnic minority communities, focusing on Asian American communities
  as illustrations. Extending Hays' (Addressing cultural complexities in practice:
  Assessment, diagnosis, and therapy, American Psychological Association, Washington,
  DC, 2008) ADDRESSING framework for considering cultural influences on a counseling
  relationship, the proposed framework provides a broad but systematic guidepost for
  considering three major cultural-ecological influences on Asian American communities:
  Race and Ethnicity (R), Culture (C), and Immigration and Transnational Ties (I).
  We provide a sequence of steps that incorporate the ADDRESSING and the RCI frameworks
  to facilitate the collaborative community-based research or social action. Â© 2010
