 abstract = {Purpose of Study: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus amongst American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults is estimated to be 16.5%, the highest of any ethnic group worldwide. The Seattle Indian Health Board (SIHB) is one of 34 urban affiliates of the Indian Health Service (IHS) serving 7203 patients, 18.1% of whom are diabetic. The purpose of this project was to improve the quality of care for the diabetic patient population served by the SIHB by addressing the need for low cost and culturally relevant diabetes education and management. Methods Used: Consultation with the SIHB agencies helped in recognizing the diabetic population as an appropriate target for a community-based intervention. Discussions with providers, patients, and community elders were critical in revealing areas of universal misunderstanding about diabetes. Research was conducted to produce a comprehensive list of accurate, relevant, and cost-free resources for diabetes information and support. An informational handout addressing diabetes myths common to the AI/AN community were generated for SIHB patients. A survey was developed in order to quantify interest of diabetic patients in becoming peer-support educators. Groundwork was laid to establish a longitudinal program for peersupport and diabetes counseling. Summary of Results: A round-table discussion including 13 diabetic patients, three members of the diabetes team, and one physician was successfully facilitated. All feedback regarding the session and the informational handout was positive. Providers, staff, and community elders all agreed that peer-support and mentoring is a culturally appropriate and effective method for low cost diabetes prevention. Collaboration between the SIHB diabetes team and key AI/AN community members was established in order to move forward with the development of a peer-support training program. Conclusion(s): Culturally relevant methods are critical to the successful prevention and management of chronic illness. Implementation of peer-support has been shown to be an effective method of raising awareness and compliance in various ethnic communities, both rural and urban. Although it is a relatively new approach in the treatment of diabetes, peer-education promises to be a useful tool in the promotion of education and trust in the AI/AN diabetic population.},
