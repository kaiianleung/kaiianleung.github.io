abstract: "Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) are increasingly seen as important
  vehicles to translate research into practice, although less is known about the process
  of engaging diverse communities in PBRN research. The objective of this study was
  to identify strategies for successfully recruiting and retaining diverse racial/ethnic
  communities into PBRN research studies. This collaborative, multisite study engaged
  5 of the 8 networks of the PRImary care MultiEthnic Network (PRIME Net) consortium
  that conducts research with traditionally underrepresented/underserved populations.
  We used a sequential, qualitative research design. We first conducted 1 key informant
  interview with each of 24 researchers experienced in recruiting research participants
  from 5 racial/ethnic communities (African American, Arab/Chaldean, Chinese, Hispanic,
  and Native American). Subsequently, we conducted 18 focus groups with 172 persons
  from these communities. Participants' comments indicated that successful recruitment
  and retention of underrepresented populations in PBRN studies is linked to the overall
  research process. This process, which we termed the cycle of trust, entailed developing
  and sustaining relationships of trust during 4 interrelated stages: before the study,
  during study recruitment, throughout study conduct, and after study completion.
  Participants identified a set of flexible strategies within each stage and called
  for close engagement with clinic and community partners. Our participants suggest
  that approaches to research that lay a foundation of trust, demonstrate respect
  for community members, and extend beyond the enrollment and data collection phases
  are essential to enhance the participation of diverse populations in PBRN research.
  These findings offer the PBRN community a guide toward achieving this important
  goal."
