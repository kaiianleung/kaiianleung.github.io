 abstract = {Qualitative methods were used to understand community perspectives about ways to deliver cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to rural Latino youth with anxiety. First, four focus groups were conducted with 28 bilingual Latino mental health providers to examine perceptions of CBT using telephone based, therapist supported bibliotherapy, and bibliotherapy without therapist support. Second, qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 Latino parents from a rural community to better understand attitudes toward CBT, and modes of service delivery. Qualitative findings revealed that parents were mostly positive about psychotherapy, and the core elements of CBT for anxiety. However, both parents and providers emphasized the need for adaptations to address practical and perceived barriers to treatment, such as time, convenience, homework, and literacy. Many parents spoke favorably of a telephone-based approach that could address many of their perceived barriers, while providers were expressed more negative views. Such findings are important for data-driven treatment development efforts.},
