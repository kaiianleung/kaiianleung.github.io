 abstract = {Objective The current study examined patterns in COVID-19 testing and vaccination intentions across multiple language groups in Greater Western Sydney, Australia.Methods Participants completed a cross-sectional survey available from March 21 to July 9, 2021 in Sydney, Australia. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). Participants could complete surveys independently or with support from bilingual staff. Logistic regression models using post-stratification weighted frequencies identified factors associated with testing and vaccination intentions.Results Most of the 708 participants (88%, n=622) were not born in Australia; 31% reported that they did not speak English well or at all (n=220); 70% had no tertiary qualifications (n=497); and 41% had inadequate health literacy (n=290). Most participants reported high testing intention (77.2%, n=546), with differences observed across language groups (p&lt;0.001). The most frequently reported barrier to testing was concerns about infection at the clinic (26.1%). Half (53.0%) reported willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended to them (n=375); 18% were unwilling (n=127), and the remainder unsure (29%, n=205). These proportions varied significantly by language group (p&lt;0.001). Participants were more likely to be unwilling/hesitant if they were female (p=0.02) or did not use Australian commercial information sources (p=0.01). Concerns about side effects (30.4%, n=102) and safety (23.9%, n=80), were key reported barriers to vaccination.Conclusion Different language groups have unique and specific needs to support uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Health services must work collaboratively with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to provide tailored support to encourage COVID-19 testing and vaccination.Lay summary708 adults living in Sydney, Australia, who did not speak English as their main language at home took part in a survey about COVID-19 vaccination and testing.Participants could complete the survey online (English/translated) or with support from bilingual staff. The survey was available in 11 languages.Three quarters of participants (77%) reported they would get tested for COVID-19 if they had symptoms ‘no matter what.’ The most common barrier was concern about getting infected at the testing clinic.53% of participants reported that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was recommended to them. 18% reported that they wouldn’t get the vaccine, and 29% were unsure. The main barriers were concerns about vaccine side effects and safety.Intentions to get tested for COVID-19 or to get vaccinated varied significantly across language groups. Participants who were female, or who did not use Australian commercial information sources were more likely to be unwilling or unsure about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.Different language groups have unique and specific needs to support uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Health services must work collaboratively with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to provide tailored support to encourage COVID-19 testing and vaccination.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was not supported by specific project funding.
