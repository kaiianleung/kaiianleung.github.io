abstract: 'Purpose: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate outcomes
  of a multimedia instructional program for family caregivers in simple touch-based
  techniques to provide comfort to cancer patients at home. Method(s): A multilingual
  78-min DVD and 66-page manual were produced for homebased instruction. Content addresses
  attitudes and communication about touch in cancer, psychological preparation for
  giving and receiving touch, safety precautions, massage techniques for comfort and
  relaxation, acupressure for specific cancer-related symptoms, and practice in the
  home setting. Materials were produced in English, Spanish, and Chinese versions.
  A community-based multiethnic sample of 97 adult patient/caregiver dyads was randomized
  to experimental (massage) or attention control (reading) groups for 4 weeks. Massage
  dyads received the program and instructions to practice at least three times per
  week, while control caregivers read to their patients for the same frequency. Self-report
  instruments assessed change in symptom severity, quality of life, perceived stress,
  and caregiver attitudes. Result(s): Significant reductions in all symptoms occurred
  for patients after both activities: 12-28 % reductions after reading vs. 29-44 %
  after massage. Massage caregivers showed significant gains in confidence, comfort,
  and self-efficacy using touch and massage as forms of caregiving. Conclusion(s):
  Multimedia instruction in touch and massage methods may offer family members a viable
  means of enhancing self-efficacy and satisfaction in caregiving while decreasing
  patient pain, depression, and other symptoms. Family members may be able to learn
  and apply safe and simple methods that increase patient comfort and reduce distress.
