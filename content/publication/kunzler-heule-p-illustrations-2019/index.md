abstract: "Background: Patient's adherence to health relevant medical and behavioral
  recommendations before and after liver transplantation improves clinical outcomes.
  Therefore, healthcare professionals should provide selfmanagement support and education.
  In our hospitals, oral counseling sessions are complemented by handing-out written
  brochures with information and advice. However, in patients with a foreign-language
  as well as for the education of complex content, it remains a challenge. Our aim
  was to develop languageindependent illustrations to support counseling of patients
  before and after liver transplantation. Method(s): We used a participatory action
  research approach. In two meetings, physicians and nurses from the Cantonal Hospital
  St. Gallen, the University Hospital Zurich and a professional illustrator (only
  participating in the second meeting) (n=8) engaged in one complete action cycle:
  1) constructing, 2) planning, 3) acting, and 4) evaluating. Result(s): In constructing,
  every participant presented three real clinical practice situations in which illustrations
  would have facilitated patient counseling. In planning, all situations were discussed
  and three overriding themes for illustrations were identified: Understanding the
  disease (e.g., portal hypertension), organizational aspects (e.g. need for medical
  check-up before listing) and life after transplant (e.g., medication taking). Finally,
  the group decided to start with four draft illustrations. In acting, the illustrator
  created drafts and presented them to the healthcare professionals in the second
  meeting. The group evaluated the drafts using the ?Thinking aloud? technique. Based
  on these results, the group discussed specific adaptations and agreed to create
  additional drafts. Finally, twelve illustrations and two illustrated self-observation
  plans before and after transplantation were drafted. In a second action research
  cycle, drafts will be evaluated by patients and other health care providers and
  revised before implementation in practice. Conclusion(s): Early involvement of relevant
  stakeholders is key in practice development projects and the application of new
  tools. We expect a high acceptance and use of the illustrations for counseling before
  and after transplantation. This in turn, might improve safety in deprived patient
  groups."
