 abstract = {Background: Patient's adherence to health relevant medical and behavioral recommendations before and after liver transplantation improves clinical outcomes. Therefore, healthcare professionals should provide selfmanagement support and education. In our hospitals, oral counseling sessions are complemented by handing-out written brochures with information and advice. However, in patients with a foreign-language as well as for the education of complex content, it remains a challenge. Our aim was to develop languageindependent illustrations to support counseling of patients before and after liver transplantation. Method(s): We used a participatory action research approach. In two meetings, physicians and nurses from the Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, the University Hospital Zurich and a professional illustrator (only participating in the second meeting) (n=8) engaged in one complete action cycle: 1) constructing, 2) planning, 3) acting, and 4) evaluating. Result(s): In constructing, every participant presented three real clinical practice situations in which illustrations would have facilitated patient counseling. In planning, all situations were discussed and three overriding themes for illustrations were identified: Understanding the disease (e.g., portal hypertension), organizational aspects (e.g. need for medical check-up before listing) and life after transplant (e.g., medication taking). Finally, the group decided to start with four draft illustrations. In acting, the illustrator created drafts and presented them to the healthcare professionals in the second meeting. The group evaluated the drafts using the ?Thinking aloud? technique. Based on these results, the group discussed specific adaptations and agreed to create additional drafts. Finally, twelve illustrations and two illustrated self-observation plans before and after transplantation were drafted. In a second action research cycle, drafts will be evaluated by patients and other health care providers and revised before implementation in practice. Conclusion(s): Early involvement of relevant stakeholders is key in practice development projects and the application of new tools. We expect a high acceptance and use of the illustrations for counseling before and after transplantation. This in turn, might improve safety in deprived patient groups.},
