abstract: Hypertension is on the rise among Hispanics and is highest among those of
  Mexican origin. Recent studies have found a positive association between air pollution
  and blood pressure and hypertension. Moreover, a link between hypertension and adverse
  socioeconomic conditions is well established. However, less is known about psychosocial
  stressors, although their impact on coronary heart disease has been shown. To address
  this gap in the literature, community perspectives of the health consequences of
  environmental exposures and psychosocial stressors experienced among the Mexican-origin
  population in Houston, Texas were obtained through participation in focus groups,
  the establishment of a Neighborhood Council of Advisors (NCA), and the testing of
  a pilot questionnaire. Taken together, the findings from the community were used
  to develop a culturally sensitive, bilingual questionnaire for an investigation
  of the combined effects of environmental and psychosocial stressors on hypertension
  among individuals of Mexican origin.
