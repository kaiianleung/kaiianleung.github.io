 abstract = {Hypertension is on the rise among Hispanics and is highest among those of Mexican origin. Recent studies have found a positive association between air pollution and blood pressure and hypertension. Moreover, a link between hypertension and adverse socioeconomic conditions is well established. However, less is known about psychosocial stressors, although their impact on coronary heart disease has been shown. To address this gap in the literature, community perspectives of the health consequences of environmental exposures and psychosocial stressors experienced among the Mexican-origin population in Houston, Texas were obtained through participation in focus groups, the establishment of a Neighborhood Council of Advisors (NCA), and the testing of a pilot questionnaire. Taken together, the findings from the community were used to develop a culturally sensitive, bilingual questionnaire for an investigation of the combined effects of environmental and psychosocial stressors on hypertension among individuals of Mexican origin.},
