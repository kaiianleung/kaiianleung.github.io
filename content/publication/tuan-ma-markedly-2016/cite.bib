 abstract = {Introduction: Vietnam, a multi-ethnic country, is one of the low-middle income countries where epidemiological information on thalassemia remains insufficient. In this study, we determined the burden of thalassemia among ethnic minorities with microcytosis. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a community of ethnic minority in Thai Nguyen province, northern Vietnam. A total of 308 minorities participated, and all of them are Tay ethnicity. Blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA were collected and determined for complete blood count using an automated hematology analyzer. Individuals with microcytosis, as indicated by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of less than 80 femtolitre (fl), were investigated further for thalassemia using an automated capillary zone electrophoresis. DNA was extracted and send to Thailand for identification of alpha-(0)-thalassemia using a gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR). Result(s): Microcytosis was found in 82 out of 308 participants (26.6%). Of these, 35 (42.7%) were found to be alpha-(0)-thalassemia traits. Using Hb A2 \textgreater 4.0% as cutoff value, beta-thalassemia heterozygote was diagnosed in 20 participants (24.4%). Hemoglobin H disease was identified in 6 cases (7.3%). Three hemoglobin E (Hb E) traits (3.7%) and 3 cases with double heterozygous state for alpha-(0)-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia (3.7%) were also found. The remaining 15 cases (18.3%) require further investigation. Conclusion(s): The findings reflect a serious burden of severe thalassemia syndromes within the study population and underline an urgent need for the establishment of laboratory facilities for thalassemia diagnosis in order to implement appropriate prevention program in the country.},
