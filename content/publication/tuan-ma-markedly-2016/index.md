abstract: 'Introduction: Vietnam, a multi-ethnic country, is one of the low-middle
  income countries where epidemiological information on thalassemia remains insufficient.
  In this study, we determined the burden of thalassemia among ethnic minorities with
  microcytosis. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a community of
  ethnic minority in Thai Nguyen province, northern Vietnam. A total of 308 minorities
  participated, and all of them are Tay ethnicity. Blood samples anticoagulated with
  EDTA were collected and determined for complete blood count using an automated hematology
  analyzer. Individuals with microcytosis, as indicated by the mean corpuscular volume
  (MCV) of less than 80 femtolitre (fl), were investigated further for thalassemia
  using an automated capillary zone electrophoresis. DNA was extracted and send to
  Thailand for identification of alpha-(0)-thalassemia using a gap-polymerase chain
  reaction (gap-PCR). Result(s): Microcytosis was found in 82 out of 308 participants
  (26.6%). Of these, 35 (42.7%) were found to be alpha-(0)-thalassemia traits. Using
  Hb A2 textgreater 4.0% as cutoff value, beta-thalassemia heterozygote was diagnosed
  in 20 participants (24.4%). Hemoglobin H disease was identified in 6 cases (7.3%).
  Three hemoglobin E (Hb E) traits (3.7%) and 3 cases with double heterozygous state
  for alpha-(0)-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia (3.7%) were also found. The remaining
  15 cases (18.3%) require further investigation. Conclusion(s): The findings reflect
  a serious burden of severe thalassemia syndromes within the study population and
  underline an urgent need for the establishment of laboratory facilities for thalassemia
  diagnosis in order to implement appropriate prevention program in the country.'
