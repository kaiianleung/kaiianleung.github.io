 abstract = {Purpose: South Asians have increased prevalence of diabetes and diabetes-related complications and immigrants are at greater risk for morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a Punjabi version of an English Diabetes Self-Management Program and make it available to Punjabi adults with type 2 diabetes in the Fraser Valley area of BC. This peer-led program provides participants with confidence, knowledge and skills to manage their diabetes. Method(s): A bilingual coordinator was employed and arranged the translation and cultural adaptation of English manuals and materials. Fifty bilingual (Punjabi and English) volunteers with diabetes were recruited and trained as program leaders and, in pairs, delivered 15 6-week programs to 170 Punjabi-speaking adults. Research Observations: Four focus group meetings were held (1 with 22 leaders and 3 involving 30 participants) to obtain perspectives of the program. As well, participants completed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) questionnaire before they started the program and again at 6 months. Conclusion(s): Leaders and participants reported changes in behaviours (i.e. diet, physical activity and taking medication), improvement in psychological status (i.e. less stress, fear and pessism regarding future health), increases in confidence (selfefficacy) in managing their health and greater community involvement. The PAM scores indicated higher activation at 6 months. The project developed an accessible and culturally relevant diabetes program for the Punjabi-speaking population in their first language, established an implementation system involving numerous community partnerships and is currently being offered on a permanent basis.},
