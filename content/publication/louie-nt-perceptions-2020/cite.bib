 abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the perceptions of and barriers to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation among Asian and Pacific Islander (API) immigrants. DESIGN: Qualitative focus groups were conducted in 4 API communities. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from 4 API communities (n = 68; 22 Tongan, 18 Vietnamese, 16 Filipino, and 12 Chinese) through local community-based organizations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. METHOD(S): Trained bilingual and bicultural researchers conducted 8 focus groups in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Prior to the start of each focus group, participants completed a demographic questionnaire which included a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Security Module. ANALYSIS: Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and those in the native languages were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts in native languages were reviewed and translated into English. All transcripts were organized in ATLAS ti version 8.0 and analyzed using thematic analysis. The USDA Food Security Module results were scored and assessed for food insecurity. RESULT(S): Median age of participants was 58 years and 59.4% (n = 38) were food insecure. Barriers to SNAP participation were identified and organized within the Social Ecological Model by the following themes: (1) unclear program information, (2) application process, (3) shame, and (4) pride. Despite commonalities found across API subgroups, unique challenges with public charge and immigration existed within the subgroups. CONCLUSION(S): Culturally relevant in-language SNAP materials and multilevel interventions are needed to mitigate barriers and increase SNAP participation rates among low-income API groups.},
