abstract: 'Purpose/Objectives: To explore perceptions of colorectal cancer (CRC) and
  self-reported CRC screening behaviors among ethnic subgroups of U. S. blacks.Design:
  Descriptive, cross-sectional, exploratory, developmental pilot.Setting: Medically
  underserved areas in Hillsborough County, FL.Sample: 62 men and women aged 50 years
  or older. Ethnic subgroup distribution included 22 African American, 20 English-speaking
  Caribbean-born, and 20 Haitian-born respondents.Methods: Community-based participatory
  research methods were used to conduct face-to-face individual interviews in the
  community.Main Research Variables: Ethnic subgroup, health access, perceptions of
  CRC (e.g., awareness of screening tests, perceived risk, perceived barriers to screening),
  healthcare provider recommendation, and self-reported CRC screening.Findings: Awareness
  of CRC screening tests, risk perception, healthcare provider recommendation, and
  self-reported use of screening were low across all subgroups. However, only 55%
  of Haitian-born participants had heard about the fecal occult blood test compared
  to 84% for English-speaking Caribbean-born participants and 91% for African Americans.
  Similarly, only 15% of Haitian-born respondents had had a colonoscopy compared to
  50% for the English-speaking Caribbean and African American subgroups.Conclusions:
  This exploratory, developmental pilot study identified lack of awareness, low risk
  perception, and distinct barriers to screening. The findings support the need for
  a larger community-based study to elucidate and address disparities among subgroups.Implications
  for Nursing: Nurses play a major role in reducing cancer health disparities through
  research, education, and quality care. Recognition of the cultural diversity of
  the U. S. black population can help nurses address health disparities and contribute
  to the health of the community.'
