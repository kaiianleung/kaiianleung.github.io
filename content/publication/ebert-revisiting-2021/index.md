abstract: Purpose This study examined the influences of bilingualism and developmental
  language disorder (DLD) on nonverbal processing speed. DLD is associated with slower
  processing speed, but the extent to which slowing extends to bilingual populations
  is not established. The possible presence of bilingual cognitive effects could also
  lead to faster processing speed among bilingual children. Method Participants included
  108 children of ages 6-8 years, including 56 Spanish-English bilinguals (29 with
  DLD and 27 with typical development) and 52 English-only monolinguals (25 with DLD
  and 27 with typical development). Language testing (in both languages for bilingual
  children) was combined with parent and school report to classify children as having
  DLD or typical language development. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
  disorder were excluded from the sample. Reaction time from a choice visual detection
  task was used to index nonverbal processing speed. Results Children with DLD demonstrated
  slower processing speed than their typically developing peers, whereas bilingual
  children demonstrated faster processing speed than monolinguals. The effects of
  DLD and bilingualism did not interact. Conclusions This study replicates prior findings
  of slowed processing speed among children with DLD in both monolingual and bilingual
  children. Evidence of faster processing speed among bilingual children contributes
  to the complex literature surrounding the circumstances of bilingual cognitive effects.
