abstract: 'Purpose Attention and language are hypothesized to interact in bilingual
  children and in children with developmental language disorder (DLD). In children
  who are bilingual, attentional control may be enhanced by repeated experience regulating
  2 languages. In children with DLD, subtle weaknesses in sustained attention may
  relate to impaired language processing. This study measured attentional control
  and sustained attention in monolingual and bilingual children with and without DLD
  in order to examine the potential influences of bilingualism and DLD, as well as
  their intersection, on attention. Method Monolingual English-only and bilingual
  Spanish-English children aged 6-8 years were categorized into participant groups
  based on eligibility testing and parent interviews. Parent interviews included standardized
  assessment of language environment and parent concern regarding language. Participants
  completed 2 nonlinguistic computerized assessments: a flanker task to measure attentional
  control and a continuous performance task to measure sustained attention. Results
  One hundred nine children met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in a participant
  group. Regression models predicting performance on the attention tasks were similar
  for both sustained attention and attentional control. For both tasks, DLD was a
  significant predictor, and bilingualism was not. Measuring bilingualism continuously
  using parent-reported exposure did not alter results. Conclusions This study found
  no evidence of a \"bilingual cognitive advantage\" on 2 types of attention among
  sequential Spanish-English bilingual children but also found a negative effect of
  DLD that was consistent across both types of attention and both bilingual and monolingual
  children. Results are consistent with the broader literature on subtle nonlinguistic
  deficits in children with DLD and suggest these deficits are minimally affected
  by diverse linguistic experience.'
