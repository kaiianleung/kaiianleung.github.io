abstract: VFRs are at a greater risk of contracting travel-related illnesses such
  as malaria, and their knowledge about travel health tends to be poor. Since 2009,
  community-based activities targeting potential and impending VFRs were performed
  by a multidisciplinary team in Madrid, Spain. The design and distribution of multilingual
  and culturally-sensitive material following a qualitative research, and intercultural
  mediators were key tools of the health education programme. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
