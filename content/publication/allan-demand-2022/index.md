abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Understanding changes in the demand and usage
  of unrelated allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) donors during
  the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to optimize pandemic preparedness of registry and
  donor collection services. The aim of this study was to understand the extent to
  which the pandemic has impacted the demand and usage of unrelated donors and cord
  blood units (CBUs) at Canadian Blood Services (CBS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data
  regarding stem cell donor interest and product usage for unrelated allogeneic HCT
  were retrieved from the database at CBS using de-identified anonymous information.
  RESULTS: Unrelated donor searches for Canadian patients remained unchanged by the
  pandemic, reflecting stable demand. The number of unrelated allogeneic transplants
  performed within Canada also remained stable, while the number of cord blood transplants
  increased, chiefly for paediatric patients. Requests for donor verification typing,
  a first signal of potential interest, increased from domestic centres during the
  first 6 months of the pandemic and decreased from international centres, before
  returning to baseline levels. The proportion of transplants for Canadian patients
  who used stem cell products procured from Canadian donors increased between 3 and
  6 months after the start of the pandemic before returning to baseline and appears
  to be increasing again more than 1 year after the start of the pandemic. Use of
  CBUs for Canadian paediatric patients increased and remains elevated. CONCLUSION:
  Demand for unrelated adult HCT donors has remained stable despite the evolving pandemic
  with a transient and recurring increased interest and usage of domestic adult donors.
  Use of CBUs for paediatric patients has increased and remains elevated. Registries
  and donor collection centres should maintain the capacity to expand services for
  domestic donor collection during pandemics to offset threats to international donor
  usage.'
