abstract: "When the COVID (SARS-V2) pandemic swept across the world, it impacted Indigenous
  communities more than others. This is due to a variety of reasons: socioeconomic
  injustice and racialization, lack of access to equitable healthcare, and linguistic
  discrimination. As a result, several communities and community types demonstrated
  this effect when perceptions of inferences or other COVID-related information were
  measured. This paper reports on a participatory collaborative study with two Indigenous
  communities in rural Peru-ten Quechua-speaking communities in Southern Cuzco and
  three Shipibo-speaking communities in Ucayali regions. We investigate the communities'
  level of preparedness for the crisis by eliciting answers based on the World Health
  Organization COVID 'MythBusters' in a form of a semi-structured interview. Interviews
  were transcribed, translated, and analyzed in search of the effect of three variables:
  gender (male/female), language group (Shipibo/Quechua), and proficiency in the Indigenous
  language (from 0 to 4). Data reveal that all three variables have some effect on
  the target comprehension of COVID-related messages. Additionally, we explore other
  possible explanations. Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors."
