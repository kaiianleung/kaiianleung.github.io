abstract: Understanding the relationships among altruistic health acts may serve to
  aid therapeutic research advances. In this paper, we report on the links between
  two such behaviours—donating blood and carrying an organ donor card—and willingness
  to donate urological tissue to a tissue bank. Reasons for the differential willingness
  to do so are examined in this paper. A systematic sample of 259 new and returning
  attendees at a tertiary urology referral clinic in Ireland completed a self-report
  questionnaire in an outpatient setting. In addition to demographic details, details
  of known diagnosis of malignancy and family history of cancer; attitudes to tissue
  donation for research purposes were gauged using a 5-point Likert scale. Both blood
  donors and organ donor card carriers were more likely to be willing to donate tissue
  for research purposes. Blood donors were more likely want to know their overall
  results in comparison to nonblood donors and want their samples to be used for nonprofit
  research. Our hypothesis that being a blood donor would be a better predictor to
  donate urological tissue than being an organ donor card carrier borne out by the
  trends reported above.
