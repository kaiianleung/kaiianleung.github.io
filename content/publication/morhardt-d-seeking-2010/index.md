abstract: 'Limited data exist on how members of different cultures understand dementia.
  The Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimers Disease Center in collaboration
  with Coalition of Limited English Speaking Elderly and Alzheimers Association-Greater
  Illinois Chapter collaborated to raise awareness in 5 limited English proficiency
  (LEP) communities (Assyrian, Arabic, Bosnian, Hindi, and Urdu) during 2005 to 2008
  through a grant from the Administration on Aging Alzheimers Disease Demonstration
  Grants to States. After the second year of the program, 267 individuals with cognitive
  impairment were identified with cognitive impairment and enrolled; however, only
  13% of those sought a medical evaluation to obtain a diagnosis or further help for
  their memory problems. This project sought to: (1) understand how these LEP community
  groups conceptualize dementia and (2) understand reasons LEP communities sought
  or did not seek a diagnosis. Using a community-based participatory research approach,
  ethnic community leaders conducted 48 interviews in a convenience sample of persons
  enrolled in the previous Administration on Aging demonstration grant. These interviews
  were conducted with family members of identified persons with dementia in their
  native language. Interview notes were translated and subjected to thematic analysis.
  The majority view memory loss as explainable and normative-due to aging, reaction
  to medication or trauma experienced by war, family problems, or the immigration
  experience. This conceptualization and the perception that a doctor cannot help
  influenced whether they sought an evaluation. Those who saw a doctor were looking
  for medical treatment and help with difficult behaviors. Experience in the doctors
  office was variable. Discussion of analysis with ethnic communities revealed the
  significance of stigma in the data gathering. Continued community-based participatory
  research approaches with LEP communities could further highlight needs for culturally
  relevant education and intervention. Â© 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.'
