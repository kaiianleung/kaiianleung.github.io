abstract: In one’s native language, visual word identification is based on early morphological
  analysis and is sensitive to the statistical structure of the mapping between form
  and meaning (Orthography–to–Semantic Consistency, OSC). How these mechanisms apply
  to a second language is much less clear. We recruited L1 Italian–L2 English speakers
  for a masked priming task where the relationship between prime and target was morphologically
  transparent, e.g., employer–EMPLOY, morphologically opaque, e.g., corner-CORN, or
  merely orthographic, e.g., brothel–BROTH. Critically, participants underwent thorough
  testing of their lexical, morphological, phonological, spelling, and semantic proficiency
  in their second language. By exploring a wide spectrum of L2 proficiency, we showed
  that this factor critically qualifies L2 priming. Genuine morphological facilitation
  only arises as proficiency grows, while orthographic priming shrinks as L2 competence
  increases. OSC was also found to modulate priming and interact with proficiency,
  providing an alternative way of describing the transparency continuum in derivational
  morphology. Overall, these data illustrate the trajectory towards a fully consolidated
  L2 lexicon and show that masked priming and sensitivity to OSC are key trackers
  of this process.
