abstract: This paper describes the conceptualization, implementation and evaluation
  framework of a community-wide education program developed to increase the use of
  screening mammography. Survey results from women in three communities in the Greater
  Los Angeles Area were used to identify baseline information on knowledge, beliefs
  and practices regarding screening mammography. This needs assessment indicated significant
  differences in the rate of mammography screening by race, preferred language, community,
  age, education, imcome and predisposing attitudes and perceptions. For instance,
  Spanish-speaking women were much less likely to have heard about breast cancer in
  the past 12 months compared with their English-speaking counterparts. Hispanic women
  were also half as likely as White women to ever have a mammogram. The intervention
  activities being implemented in this education program respond to the various findings.
  A quasi-experimental design consisting of two treatment communities and one control
  community is used to evaluate the effects of the program. Formative evaluation methods
  are used as well. The details of the community interventions and the implications
  for health education practice are discussed.
