abstract: We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel
  English-Chinese texts. Our report concerns three related topics:(1) progress on
  the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus;(2) experiments addressing the
  applicability of Gale & Church's length-based statistical method to the task of
  alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and(3) an improved statistical
  method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.
