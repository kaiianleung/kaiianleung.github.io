 abstract = {We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts. Our report concerns three related topics:(1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus;(2) experiments addressing the applicability of Gale & Church's length-based statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and(3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.},
