abstract: "Purpose of study Racial/ethnic health disparities are preventable differences
  in health outcomes between different races/ethnicities that are closely linked to
  social, economic, or environmental disadvantages. Geography continues to be a predictor
  of health disparities where infant mortality and chronic health outcomes appear
  to be intensified in high poverty tract areas in which African Americans and Latinos
  tend to live, compared to poor non-Hispanic whites. Watts is perpetually constructed
  as an under-resourced neighbourhood of Los Angeles where residents experience the
  poorest health. Resources and community health fairs have been identified as effective
  approaches to reach residents, ensuring health screenings, resource sharing, and
  gathering data. The primary objective of this study was to provide basic screenings
  and resources, while assess effectiveness of the fair and gather residents' healthrelated
  seeking behaviours to identify community-driven strategies to improve overall health.
  Methods used Using community based participatory research, this study developed
  and administered a bilingual survey to capture residents' perspectives on the effectiveness
  of the fair, personal health seeking behaviours, and suggestions to improve health
  and wellbeing in the community. The surveys were deidentified and coded for frequency
  analysis of responses using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Summary of results
  Of the 200 attendees, 107 completed the survey: 71 Latinos, 28 African Americans,
  73 Females, 26 Males, 31 between the ages of 36-45, and 51 with a household income
  under $15 000. Respondents determined their primary reason for attending was health
  screenings and identified transportation as a barrier to making their doctor's appointment.
  The park and library were resources accessed the most, and community-driven recommendations
  included nutritional education and more health fairs. Conclusions Resources and
  health fairs in low-income communities serve as immediate approaches for low-income
  and racial/ethnic minority populations. However, health fairs are not able to follow-up
  with most participants and may be inconsistent. Therefore, large-scale interventions
  should address limitations to ensure wellbeing in these areas."
