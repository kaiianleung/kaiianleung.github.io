abstract: 'Autism is described as a lifelong neurodevelopmental spectrum condition,
  with each individual varying in their abilities across social and cognitive domains.
  The current prevalence estimates range between 1/100 and 1/132 worldwide. Autism
  is characterized by a complex collection of manifestations, with repetitive behaviours,
  social communication difficulties, and sensory hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity.
  There is evidence to suggest that certain executive function (EF) skills (a group
  of important thinking skills that allow individuals to set and complete goals) are
  impaired in autistic children. These include interference control (the ability to
  resist distracting information), flexible switching (the ability to switch between
  thoughts and adapt behaviour according to a changing environment) and sustained
  attention (the ability to focus over a period of time). Furthermore, impairments
  in these EF domains have been evidenced to underlie some of the key characteristics
  of autism and negatively impact quality of life. There is also evidence to suggest
  that knowledge of two languages (i.e., bilingualism; a skill shared by more than
  half of the world’s population, comprising an extensive spectrum of language experiences
  and markers) has the potential to ameliorate these EF domains. This evidence is
  surrounded by debate, however, with evidence for and against a bilingual advantage.
  Nevertheless, bilingual disadvantages in EF domains are rarely, if ever, in evidence.
  Despite this, there are parent and practitioner concerns with respect to raising
  autistic children speaking more than one language. This raises the question: what
  kind of impact does bilingualism have on the EF abilities of autistic children?
  Could bilingualism mitigate potential EF difficulties in autistic children? Well,
  only a handful of studies worldwide have explored this question, all of which strongly
  support the idea that bilingualism is not harmful to autistic children’s EF development,
  and may even confer some advantages. Nevertheless, our understanding of the EF profiles
  of bilingual autistic children remains very limited. Given the rising diagnostic
  rates of autism and increases in the worldwide bilingual population, it is imperative
  to chart the effects of bilingualism on autism, especially in a domain evidenced
  to impact quality of life like EF. This doctoral research explores the effects of
  bilingualism on a group of EF skills selected based on their theoretical relevance
  to bilingualism (i.e., the Adaptive Control Hypothesis) and autism (the Executive
  Dysfunction Theory). All data were collected in the United Arab Emirates, a country
  that offers a 3 predominantly dual-language switching environment (i.e., using two
  languages in the same context), which is also of theoretical relevance to bilingualism.
  Using directly-assessed, experimental measures of EF, findings from the first investigation
  (Chapter 3) with 93 participants (autistic and typically developing), revealed an
  advantage for bilingual autistic children on one outcome measure of sustained attention
  and equivalent performance to monolingual autistic children on all other EF outcome
  measures. The findings from this investigation, however, reflect EF performance
  using laboratory-type tasks, assessed at one point in time. This is at best, a partial
  picture of EF, bilingualism and autism. Therefore, I then asked, what is the impact
  of bilingualism on EF if the measures deployed capture a wider time span and everyday
  types of situations? To address this knowledge gap, I launched the second investigation
  (Chapter 4) with 80 participants (autistic and typically developing) using informant-report
  measures of EF, capturing both parent and teacher perspectives on children’s abilities.
  The first key finding is that parent-reported EF revealed an advantage for bilingual
  autistic children on all EF domains, relative to monolingual autistic peers. The
  second key finding is that second language proficiency predicted parent-reported
  sustained attention, and second language current exposure predicted parent-reported
  interference control. The third key finding is that poorer parentreported EF abilities
  were associated with more clinically significant features of autism. Given the known
  heterogeneity between autistic children, my third and final investigation (Chapter
  5) went on to examine variability in my data in more detail, using a multiple case
  series approach to analyse EF data from 27 autistic participants. The first key
  finding was that the individual experience of autism seemed to shape EF capabilities.
  To illustrate, in contrast to group-level findings (Chapters 3 and 4) which framed
  autistic group performance as ‘impaired’, a multiple case series analysis showed
  that the majority of autistic participants performed equivalently to typically developing
  peers. The second key finding is that I found no support for ‘spiky’ autistic EF
  profiles (i.e., one that has a mix of enhanced, impaired, and average performance).
  The third key finding was that more strengths were revealed on directly-assessed
  EF than parent-reported EF, which was, in turn, more positive than teacher-reported
  EF. To my knowledge, this is the first investigation at this interface to use a
  multidimensional EF approach – EF was assessed via a combination of direct and informantbased
  (parent and teacher reports) measures – and to employ mixed analytic methods (i.e.,
  group and multiple case series analysis). Further new contributions come from the
  inclusion 4 of sustained attention as a relevant domain of interest. Additionally,
  this work contributes to the diversification of autism research samples beyond WEIRD
  (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) samples. Finally, this work
  contributes new findings from the targeted investigation of the Adaptive Control
  Hypothesis theoretical model in a non-typical population. In the final chapter (Chapter
  6), the overall findings of the study are discussed, to draw conclusions, identify
  evidence-based implications for families, practitioners, researchers, and chart
  new areas of bilingualism research in childhood autism.'
