abstract: The potential effects of bilingualism on executive control (EC) have been
  heavily debated. One possible source of discrepancy in the evidence may be that
  bilingualism tends to be treated as a monolithic category distinct from monolingualism.
  We address this possibility by examining the effects of different bilingual language
  experiences on brain activity related to EC performance. Participants were scanned
  (fMRI) while they performed a Flanker task. Behavioral data showed robust Flanker
  effects, not modulated by language experiences across participants. However, differences
  in duration of bilingual experience and extent of active language use predicted
  activation in distinct brain regions indicating differences in neural recruitment
  across conditions. This approach highlights the need to consider specific bilingual
  language experiences in assessing neurocognitive effects. It further underscores
  the utility and complementarity of neuroimaging evidence in this general line of
  research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the variability reported in
  the literature. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
