abstract: Rates of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), especially high among adolescents,
  are associated with comorbid disorders including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic
  stress disorder, and eating disorders. Hispanic adolescents engage in NSSI at rates
  similar to or higher than their Caucasian counterparts, but little research exists
  on Spanish-language markers of mental health. This study, harnessing data from the
  social media platform Tumblr, collected pro-NSSI public blog posts written in Spanish
  and analyzed their content with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software.
  Pro-NSSI linguistic properties, psychological linguistic properties, and signature
  words were analyzed, and results revealed that, of pro-NSSI terms, reasons for NSSI
  was the most frequently used category in posts. This result aligns with the literature
  because words associated with negative emotions are commonly presented in the dominant
  language within trauma narratives. Evaluation of linguistic properties indicated
  that users could be code-switching to avoid encountering overwhelming emotions,
  a practice common among bilingual individuals. The psychological properties of these
  blog posts had an emphatically negative emotional tone when written in Spanish and
  a more concrete and less emotionally charged tone when users switched to English.
  This research suggests benefits to assessing bilingual clients for pro-NSSI and
  online-posting behaviors, while underscoring both the need for improved evidence-based
  practices for treating trauma in bilingual clients and, broadly speaking, the importance
  of Spanish and code-switching norms for blogs and social media platforms.
