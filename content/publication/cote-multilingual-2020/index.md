abstract: Many children grow up hearing multiple languages, learning vocabulary words
  in each. How does the number of languages being learned affect multilinguals’ vocabulary
  development? In a pre-registered study, we compared productive vocabularies of bilingual
  (n =170) and trilingual (n =20) toddlers aged 17–33 months growing up in a bilingual
  community where both French and English are spoken. We hypothesized that because
  trilinguals have reduced input in French and English due to time spent hearing their
  third language, they would have smaller French–English vocabulary sizes than bilinguals.
  Trilinguals produced on average 2/3 of the number of words in these languages that
  bilinguals did, however this difference was not statistically robust due to large
  levels of variability. Follow-up analyses did, however, indicate a relationship
  between input quantity and vocabulary size. Our results indicate that similar factors
  contribute to vocabulary development across toddlers regardless of the number of
  languages being acquired.
