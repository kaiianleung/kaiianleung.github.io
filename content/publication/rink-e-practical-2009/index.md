abstract: Increasingly, community-based participatory research (CBPR), with its emphasis
  on engaging communities as full and equal partners in all phases of the research
  process is being promoted to address the health needs of peoples living in the North
  American Arctic. However, the CBPR approach is not without its challenges in Arctic
  countries such as Greenland, where research capacity, different languages, distance,
  time and cost become barriers to remaining true to the purest form of CBPR. In this
  paper, we describe the practical application of CBPR principles and methodologies
  to a sexual health project investigating sexually transmitted infections in Greenland.
  We present the initial challenges encountered in the early stages of the pilot CBPR
  sexual health study, and solutions to these challenges. We also provide recommendations
  for expanding the capacity in Greenland to conduct CBPR projects.
