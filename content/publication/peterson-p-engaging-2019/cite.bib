 abstract = {In Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, factors such as cultural and linguistic diversity make it difficult for public health agencies to reach immigrant and racial/ethnic minority populations with health initiatives. Founded in 2006, the Minnesota Immunization Networking Initiative (MINI) is a community project that has provided more than 80 000 free influenza vaccinations to vulnerable populations, including immigrants and racial/ethnic minority groups. MINI administered 5910 vaccinations through 99 community-based vaccination clinics during the 2017-2018 influenza season and surveyed the clients in their own language about influenza vaccination knowledge and practices. Among those surveyed, 2545 (43.1%) were uninsured and 408 (6.9%) received a first-time influenza vaccination at the MINI clinic. A total of 2893 (49.0%) respondents heard about the clinic through their faith community. Lessons learned included the importance of building relationships with community leaders and involving them as full partners, holding clinics in community-based settings to bring vaccinations to clients, and reporting outcomes to partners.Copyright © 2019, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.},
