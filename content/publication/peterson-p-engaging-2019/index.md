abstract: In Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, factors such as cultural and linguistic
  diversity make it difficult for public health agencies to reach immigrant and racial/ethnic
  minority populations with health initiatives. Founded in 2006, the Minnesota Immunization
  Networking Initiative (MINI) is a community project that has provided more than
  80 000 free influenza vaccinations to vulnerable populations, including immigrants
  and racial/ethnic minority groups. MINI administered 5910 vaccinations through 99
  community-based vaccination clinics during the 2017-2018 influenza season and surveyed
  the clients in their own language about influenza vaccination knowledge and practices.
  Among those surveyed, 2545 (43.1%) were uninsured and 408 (6.9%) received a first-time
  influenza vaccination at the MINI clinic. A total of 2893 (49.0%) respondents heard
  about the clinic through their faith community. Lessons learned included the importance
  of building relationships with community leaders and involving them as full partners,
  holding clinics in community-based settings to bring vaccinations to clients, and
  reporting outcomes to partners.Copyright Â© 2019, Association of Schools and Programs
