 abstract = {Background: There is an increasing body of literature that suggests a relationship between modifiable dietary behaviors and alcohol use and liver cancer. We designed and implemented a culturally tailored community-based education program to promote liver cancer prevention. Method(s): Through NCI funded U54 TUFCCC/HC Cancer Partnership Community Outreach Core program, using CBPR approach, we engaged community-based organizations and community stakeholders serving underserved African, Asian, and Hispanic American communities in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and New York City. The community-based education incorporated in-person and virtual hybrid education workshops to address COVID-19 pandemic barriers. We conducted pre-education surveys and follow-up assessments at 6 months post-education. Participants' dietary behaviors, alcohol use, and sociodemographic characteristics were examined at both time points. Result(s): 526 participants were recruited including 92 African Americans, 247 Asian Americans, and 187 Hispanic Americans, with an average age of 59. We found that at 6- month follow-up assessment, participants had average decreased intake of red meat (3.148/6 vs. 2.685/6, p \textless 0.001), and average increased intake of vegetables (4.484/6 vs. 5.044/6, p \textless 0.001) and fruits (4.327/6 vs. 4.877/6, p \textless 0.001), compared to their intake at pre-education assessment. Additionally, average change in beer (-0.252) and spirit (-0.905) consumption substantively decreased from pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up assessment. Conclusion(s): This community-based education showed significant effects in improving healthy dietary behaviors and reducing alcohol intake among community members through CBPR community engagement from the two metropolitan areas. Future efforts are needed to sustain the positive changes in modifiable lifestyle behaviors and liver cancer prevention in these medically underserved communities.},
