abstract: Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects Latinos increasing their risk
  of diabetes-related complications. This study used a randomized controlled design
  with a community-based approach to evaluate the impact of a culturally tailored
  pharmacist intervention on clinical outcomes in Latino diabetics. The intervention
  included a focused discussion and two individual pharmacist counseling sessions
  on medication, nutrition, exercise, and self-care to promote behavior changes. Sessions
  were culturally adapted for language, diet, family participation, and cultural beliefs.
  Clinical outcomes were measured at baseline and three months. Nineteen intervention
  and 24 control participants completed the study. Mean BMI reduction was greater
  for intervention than for control group participants (-0.73+/- 0.07 kg/m2 versus
  + 0.37+/-0.02 kg/ m2 ptextless.009 respectively). Hemoglobin A1c was significantly
  reduced by 0.93+/-0.45% in the intervention group only. There was no significant
  difference in blood glucose, blood pressure, or lipid levels. An innovative culturally-
  sensitive pharmacist intervention improved selected clinical outcomes among Latino
  diabetics. Â© Meharry Medical College.
