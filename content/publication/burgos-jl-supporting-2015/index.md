abstract: "BACKGROUND: The sizeable US Latino population calls for increasing the
  pipeline of minority and bilingual physicians who can provide culturally competent
  care. Currently, only 5.5% of US providers are Hispanic/Latino, compared with 16%
  of the US population (i.e., textgreater50.5 million persons). By 2060, it is predicted
  that about one-third of all US residents will be of Latino ethnicity., ACTIVITIES
  AND OUTCOMES: This article describes the Health Frontiers in Tijuana Undergraduate
  Internship Program (HFiT-UIP), a new quarterly undergraduate internship program
  based at a US-Mexico binational student-run free clinic and sponsored by the University
  of California, San Diego School of Medicine and the Universidad Autonoma de Baja
  California in Tijuana, Mexico. The HFiT-UIP provides learning opportunities for
  students and underrepresented minorities interested in medical careers, specifically
  Latino health., DISCUSSION: The HFiT-UIP might serve as a model for other educational
  partnerships across the US-Mexico border region and may help minority and other
  undergraduates seeking academic and community-based enrichment experiences. The
  HFiT-UIP can also support students' desires to learn about Latino, border, and global
  health within resource-limited settings."
