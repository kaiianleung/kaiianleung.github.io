abstract: Bilingualism is a valuable tool that enriches and facilitates cultural,
  social and lived experiences for autistic and non-autistic people alike. Research
  consistently finds no negative effects of bilingualism and highlights the potential
  for positive effects across cognitive and socio-cultural domains for autistic and
  non-autistic children. Yet parents of autistic children remain concerned that bilingualism
  will cause delays in both cognitive and language development and are still frequently
  advised by practitioners to raise their child monolingually. Evidently, findings
  from research are not reflected in practice or subsequent advice, and it is essential
  to identify ways to ensure equal access to additional language learning.We briefly
  summarise the existing literature on bilingualism and autism, considering perspectives
  from the bilingual autistic community, and experimental research. We identify the
  most pertinent barriers to participation for autistic bilingual children in terms
  of familial, clinical and educational perspectives. We propose novel solutions to
  promote additional language learning, and suggest changes to practice that will
  contribute to an evidence base for families and practitioners. This commentary makes
  innovative recommendations at both the individual and societal level to ensure that
  autistic bilingual people have equal rights and opportunities to language learning
  and are optimally supported in accessing them.
