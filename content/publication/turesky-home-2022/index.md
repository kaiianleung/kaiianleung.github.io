abstract: 'The home language and literacy environment (HLLE) in infancy has been associated
  with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLLE at preschool-age has been
  shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve pre-reading
  and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked
  with both HLLE and white matter organization. It is important to understand whether
  the relationships between environmental factors such as HLLE and SES and white matter
  organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized
  by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible
  to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized that HLLE (1) relates to white
  matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2)
  mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses,
  infants (mean age: 8.6 +/- 2.3 months, N = 38) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging
  MRI during natural sleep. Image processing was performed with an infant-specific
  pipeline and fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the arcuate fasciculus
  (AF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) bilaterally using the baby automated
  fiber quantification method. HLLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the
  StimQ (StimQ-Reading) and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported
  maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to our statistical models
  as a proxy for confounding genetic effects. StimQ-Reading positively correlated
  with FA in left AF and to maternal education, but did not mediate the relationship
  between them. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering
  HLLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies
  to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity. Copyright
