abstract: Indigenous Peoples retain traditional coping strategies for disasters despite
  the marginalisation of many Indigenous communities. This article describes the response
  of Māori to the Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2012 through analyses of available
  statistical data and reports, and interviews done three months and one year after
  the most damaging event. A significant difference between Māori and 'mainstream'
  New Zealand was the greater mobility enacted by Māori throughout this period, with
  organisations having roles beyond their traditional catchments throughout the disaster,
  including important support for non-Māori. Informed engagement with Indigenous communities,
  acknowledging their internal diversity and culturally nuanced support networks,
  would enable more efficient disaster responses in many countries.
