abstract: "Background: Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is integral in NCI-designated
  Cancer Centers. COEs work with community stakeholders identifying community needs,
  communicating research, and catalyzing significant activities to Cancer Center's
  catchment areas. To facilitate this, the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC)
  Office of COE established the Research Outreach for Southern Arizona (ROSA) program,
  supporting bidirectional partnerships between basic scientists and underrepresented
  communities in catchment areas. Objective(s): To describe a community and student
  ambassador program developed as ROSA, bridging gaps between basic science programs
  and community needs in UACC catchment areas. Method(s): The UACC catchment areas
  include five southern Arizona counties where 40% of residents are Hispanic, compared
  to 18.3% in the US. Moreover, ambassadors were bilingual/bicultural Hispanic undergraduate
  students (n=4) and Hispanic community members (n=4). The ambassador program held
  weekly cancer educational discussions, research methods, monthly Meet the Scientist
  events, and presentations on experiences. Evaluations for ROSA were completed by
  all affiliates. Result(s): Overall, ROSA ambassadors reported increased knowledge
  of research and increased confidence sharing cancer information. Facilitators of
  ROSA community members included a bilingual/bicultural team, outreach collaborations,
  and participant compensation. Barriers included payments for undocumented members,
  lack of Spanish-speaking scientists, and reduced in-person activities. As a result
  of ROSA partnerships, scientists, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders is
  developing Scientific Cafes where scientists present research proposals for community
  feedback. The workgroup will select a community-driven project to implement in the
  future. Discussion(s): Based on positive ambassador evaluations and working group
  collaborations, ROSA is successful in growing authentic partnerships between scientists
  and communities. Recently, a community-based survey was developed by members to
  examine perceptions of cancer and willingness of clinical research participation.
  This survey will inform how basic scientists align research within community needs.
  ROSA will continue to be valuable in providing bidirectional engagement from basic
  scientists and community members in cancer research."
