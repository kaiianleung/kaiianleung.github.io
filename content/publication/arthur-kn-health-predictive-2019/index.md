abstract: Significant evidence demonstrates the powerful effects social determinants
  have on health-related perceptions, behaviors, and health outcomes. However, these
  factors are often studied out of context, despite the acknowledgement that social
  determinants of health are place based. This research aimed to demonstrate that
  health-related perceptions are dependent on where one lives. Via a community-based
  participatory study, participants were randomly selected from 3 residential regions
  varying distances from a freight railyard (nearest n = 300, middle n = 338, farthest
  n = 327), all mostly low-income, predominately Latino areas. Interview-administered
  surveys with adults were collected by bilingual trained community members (87% response)
  in English/Spanish. Adjusted-logistic regression models assessed residential region
  as a predictor of stressors (perceptions of community safety, community noise disturbance,
  health care access, food insecurity) and buffers (3 neighborhood cohesion variables),
  after adjusting for household income, race/ethnicity, gender, and age. Each region
  experienced a unique amalgam of stressors and buffers. In general, the region closest
  to the railyard experienced more stressors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58; 95% CI 1.12-2.20)
  and less buffers (OR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.49-0.96) than the region furthest from the
  railyard. More than half of participants in each region reported 2 or more stressors
  and 2 or more buffers. In this seemingly homogenous study population, place remained
  important in spite of traditionally used socioeconomic factors, such as household
  income and race/ethnicity. Social determinants of health should be studied with
  regard to their environmental context, which will require interdisciplinary collaboration
  to improve multilevel research methods. Including the study of social buffers will
  also promote sustainable, positive change to reduce health disparities.
