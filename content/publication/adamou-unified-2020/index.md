abstract: 'Aims and Objectives/Purpose/Research Questions: The connection between
  language contact and the bilingual speaker goes back to foundational authors in
  the field of contact linguistics. Yet there is very little work that combines these
  two levels in a single study. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to language
  contact by testing the role of cross-language priming on contact-induced change
  at the level of complex NPs.Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted three studies
  with different types of data. In Study 1, we analyse the Romani Morpho-Syntax database
  to identify word order preferences in Romani dialects from different countries.
  In Study 2, we examine a corpus of interviews in Romani from Romania. In Study 3,
  we conduct an experiment to test short-term priming in adjective/noun order from
  Romanian to Romani and within Romani.Data and Analysis: In Study 1, we examine the
  word order in approximately 3,000 NPs from 119 Romani speakers. In Study 2, we analyse
  a speech corpus of 9,400 words from four elderly Romani-Romanian bilinguals. In
  Study 3, 90 Romani-Romanian bilinguals participated in a priming experiment. We
  used multinomial mixed-effects logistic regression, Bayesian models and Random Forests
  to analyse the experimental results.Findings/Conclusions: Study 1 shows that Romani
  speakers from Romania stand out for their frequent use of postnominal adjectives.
  Study 2 confirms these uses in free speech. Study 3 reveals significant cross-language
  priming effects, whereby speakers favour the use of DET-N-ADJ order in Romani immediately
  following a NDET-ADJ sentence read in Romanian.Originality: Our study is the first
  to demonstrate cross-language priming effects on linguistic change in adjective/noun
  order.Significance/Implications: We illustrate a unified approach to language contact
  by introducing theoretical and methodological advances from the field of bilingualism
  into the study of contact-induced change.'
