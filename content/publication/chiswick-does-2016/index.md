abstract: This paper uses the pooled data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey
  to analyze the economic benefits of bilingualism to adult men born in the United
  States. Bilingualism among the native born is defined as speaking a language at
  home other than or in addition to English. Native born bilingualism is rare; only
  6.5 percent report a non-English language, and of those 71 percent report Spanish.
  Most of the native born bilinguals report speaking English \"very well\" (85 percent),
  with most of the others speaking it \"well\" (10 percent). Other variables the same,
  bilinguals earn 4.7 percent less than monolingual English speakers, but the earnings
  differential varies sharply by the language spoken. Those who speak Native American
  languages, Pennsylvania Dutch and Yiddish have very low earnings, likely because
  they live in isolated geographic or cultural enclaves. Those who speak certain Western
  European and East Asian languages and Hebrew earn significantly more than monolingual
  English speakers. Spanish speakers earn 20 percent less than the monolingual English
  speakers overall, but other variables the same, have statistically significant seven
  percent lower earnings. bilingualism, earnings, native born, linguistic enclaves
