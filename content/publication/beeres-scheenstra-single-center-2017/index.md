abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate foreign language acquisition at school in cochlear
  implant patients., STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study., SETTING: CI center., PATIENTS: Forty
  three cochlear implants (CI) patients (10-18 yr) were evaluated. CI nonusers and
  patients with CI-explantation, incomplete datasets, mental retardation, or concomitant
  medical disorders were excluded., INTERVENTION(S): Additional data (type of schooling,
  foreign language learning, and bilingualism) were obtained with questionnaires.
  German-speaking children with foreign tuition language (English and/or French) at
  school were enrolled for further testing., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): General patient
  data, auditory data, and foreign language data from both questionnaires and tests
  were collected and analyzed., RESULTS: Thirty seven out of 43 questionnaires (86%)
  were completed. Sixteen (43%) were in mainstream education. Twenty-seven CI users
  (73%) have foreign language learning at school. Fifteen of these were in mainstream
  education (55%), others in special schooling. From 10 CI users without foreign language
  learning, one CI user was in mainstream education (10%) and nine patients (90%)
  were in special schooling. Eleven German-speaking CI users were further tested in
  English and six additionally in French. For reading skills, the school objectives
  for English were reached in 7 of 11 pupils (64%) and for French in 3 of 6 pupils
  (50%). For listening skills, 3 of 11 pupils (27%) reached the school norm in English
  and none in French., CONCLUSIONS: Almost 75% of our CI users learn foreign language(s)
  at school. A small majority of the tested CI users reached the current school norm
  for in English and French in reading skills, whereas for hearing skills most of
  them were not able to reach the norm.'
