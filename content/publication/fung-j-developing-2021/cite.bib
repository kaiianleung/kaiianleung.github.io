 abstract = {Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the USA. Despite the availability of screening mammograms, significant disparities still exist in breast cancer outcomes of racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities. To address these disparities, the Mount Sinai Mobile Breast Health Program in New York City collaborated with local organizations to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate breast cancer education programs aimed at increasing screening mammogram utilization. Literature review of the barriers to mammography screening formed the basis to allow us to draft a narrative presentation for each targeted cultural group: African American, African-born, Chinese, Latina, and Muslim women, as well as LGBTQ individuals. The presentations were then tested with focus groups comprised of gatekeepers and members from local community and faith-based organizations which served the targeted populations. Feedback from focus groups and gatekeepers was incorporated into the presentations, and if necessary, the presentations were translated. Subsequently, the presentations were re-tested for appropriateness and reviewed for consistency in message, design, educational information, and slide sequencing. Our experience demonstrated the importance of collaborating with community organizations to provide educational content that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for minority groups facing barriers to uptake of screening mammography.},
