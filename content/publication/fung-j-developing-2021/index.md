abstract: 'Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the
  USA. Despite the availability of screening mammograms, significant disparities still
  exist in breast cancer outcomes of racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities. To
  address these disparities, the Mount Sinai Mobile Breast Health Program in New York
  City collaborated with local organizations to develop culturally and linguistically
  appropriate breast cancer education programs aimed at increasing screening mammogram
  utilization. Literature review of the barriers to mammography screening formed the
  basis to allow us to draft a narrative presentation for each targeted cultural group:
  African American, African-born, Chinese, Latina, and Muslim women, as well as LGBTQ
  individuals. The presentations were then tested with focus groups comprised of gatekeepers
  and members from local community and faith-based organizations which served the
  targeted populations. Feedback from focus groups and gatekeepers was incorporated
  into the presentations, and if necessary, the presentations were translated. Subsequently,
  the presentations were re-tested for appropriateness and reviewed for consistency
  in message, design, educational information, and slide sequencing. Our experience
  demonstrated the importance of collaborating with community organizations to provide
  educational content that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for minority
  groups facing barriers to uptake of screening mammography.'
