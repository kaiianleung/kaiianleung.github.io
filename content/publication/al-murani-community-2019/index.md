abstract: "Background: Community-based approaches have been identified as an effective
  strategy to address the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide.
  However, little is known about community as a concept among people living in socioeconomically
  disadvantaged settings and stakeholders' interactions and engagement in NCDs prevention
  and management. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand; (1) the meaning
  of community among people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs in Region
  Stockholm and (2) how communities interact and engage with stakeholders at local
  and regional levels for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
  Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in three municipalities in Region
  Stockholm with a high proportion of migrants. Multiple data collection methods were
  used, including observations of community activities; interviews with community
  members, representatives of public authorities and NGOs; and group interviews with
  healthcare providers. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Community
  was perceived as living in close proximity with shared beliefs, values and resources.
  Although they recognized its social and cultural diversity, community members focused
  more on the commonalities of living in their neighborhood and less on their differences
  in country of birth and languages spoken. Several mismatches between awareness of
  community needs and the available skills and resources among stakeholders for T2D
  prevention were identified. Stakeholders expressed awareness of T2D risk and interest
  in addressing it in a culturally appropriate manner. Conclusion: Interaction between
  the communities and stakeholders was limited, as was engagement in T2D prevention
  and management. This highlights barriers in the collaboration between community,
  healthcare institutions and other stakeholders which consequently affect the implementation
  of preventive interventions. Innovative ways to link the community to the healthcare
  sector and other local government institutions are needed to build the capacity
  of health systems for T2D prevention in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities."
