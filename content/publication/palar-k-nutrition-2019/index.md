abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the perceived health benefits of an urban home
  gardening and nutritional education program in a population at high cardiometabolic
  risk. DESIGN: Qualitative data collected via in-depth, semistructured interviews
  in Spanish or English. SETTING: Community-based program offering supported urban
  home gardening together with nutrition education in Santa Clara County, CA. PARTICIPANTS:
  A total of 32 purposively sampled low-income participants in an urban home gardening
  program. Participants were primarily female (n=24) and Latino/a (n=22). PHENOMENON
  OF INTEREST: Perceptions of the nutrition and health benefits of education-enhanced
  urban home gardening. ANALYSIS: Bilingual researchers coded transcripts using a
  hybrid inductive and deductive approach. Two coders double coded at intervals, independently
  reviewed coding reports, organized content into key themes, and selected exemplary
  quotations. RESULT(S): The most salient perceived impacts were greater food access,
  increased consumption of fresh produce, a shift toward home cooking, and decreased
  fast food consumption. Participants attributed these changes to greater affordability,
  freshness, flavor, and convenience of their garden produce; increased health motivation
  owing to pride in their gardens; and improved nutritional knowledge. Participants
  also reported improved physical activity, mental health, and stress management;
  some reported improved weight and adherence to diabetes-healthy diets. CONCLUSIONS
  AND IMPLICATIONS: Education-enhanced urban home gardening may facilitate multidimensional
  nutrition and health improvements in marginalized populations at high cardiometabolic
  risk.Copyright Â© 2019 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior. Published by
