abstract: Brazilians are among the fastest growing segment of immigrant populations
  in several states of the United States. Culturally appropriate and validated health
  survey instruments do not exist to adequately assess the health needs of this population.
  Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, a cross-cultural
  pilot project was conducted to develop and test a culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese-version
  of the health-promoting lifestyle profile II (HPLP-II) instrument with a convenience
  sample of 60 bilingual and bicultural Brazilian immigrants using a combined quasi
  experimental and focus group design. The project evaluated HPLP-II instrument's
  psychometric properties of equivalency, reliability, and score distribution in Portuguese
  and English. This pilot test supports equivalency, consistency, and reliability
  of the English and culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese versions of the instrument.
  CBPR is an effective approach in health instrument development. This instrument
  is an important first step in designing other appropriate instruments to explore
  health conditions of Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business
