abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Android tablet computers can be valuable tools for data collection,
  but their usability has not been evaluated in community-based participatory research
  (CBPR)., OBJECTIVES: This article examines the usability of a low-cost bilingual
  touchscreen computerized survey system using Android tablets, piloted with a sample
  of 201 community residents in Tampa, Florida, from November 2013 to March 2014.,
  METHODS: Needs assessment questions were designed with the droidSURVEY software,
  and deployed using Android tablet computers. In addition, participants were asked
  questions about system usability., RESULTS: The mean system usability was 77.57
  +/- 17.66 (range, 0-100). The mean completion time for taking the 63 survey questions
  in the needs assessment was 23.11 +/- 9.62 minutes. The survey completion rate was
  optimal (100%), with only 6.34% missingness per variable. We found no sociodemographic
  differences in usability scores., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Android
  tablets could serve as useful tools in CBPR studies.'
