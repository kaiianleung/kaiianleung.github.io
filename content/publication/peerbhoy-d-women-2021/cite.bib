 abstract = {Objective: The aim of this project was to document a partnership working process from a cross-sectoral and cross-cultural participatory health research study focused on promoting physical activity among women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Design(s): A participatory health research paradigm was used to support this pilot feasibility study into partnership working for health promotion. Action research and community development principles underpinned the design, delivery and interpretation of findings from a community-based survey, data from four focus groups and bespoke interventions. Setting(s): Community groups from education, leisure, health and religious community sectors, and charity sectors, in the City of Liverpool, met in different venues representing those sectors. Method(s): Reflection on the process of community engagement in a research study guided by socio-ecological model, community development and action research principles. Result(s): Seven emerging collaborative processes based on effective partnership working, capacity-building practice and sustaining health and wellbeing evolved from a partnership between a Community Researchers Advisory Group and a Partners Advisory Group. BAME 'community connectors' were key to obtaining feedback from 213 women from 16 ethnic groups, which influenced the development of bespoke interventions and local sport and physical activity long-term policy, as one means of reducing social inequalities for women from BAME backgrounds. Conclusion(s): This feasibility study demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of partnership working as a public health tool. The local Sport and Physical Activity Alliance and council department worked together to promote the sustainability of BAME-focused programmes as part of their governance and policy frameworks.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.},
