abstract: "Objective: The aim of this project was to document a partnership working
  process from a cross-sectoral and cross-cultural participatory health research study
  focused on promoting physical activity among women from Black, Asian and minority
  ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Design(s): A participatory health research paradigm was
  used to support this pilot feasibility study into partnership working for health
  promotion. Action research and community development principles underpinned the
  design, delivery and interpretation of findings from a community-based survey, data
  from four focus groups and bespoke interventions. Setting(s): Community groups from
  education, leisure, health and religious community sectors, and charity sectors,
  in the City of Liverpool, met in different venues representing those sectors. Method(s):
  Reflection on the process of community engagement in a research study guided by
  socio-ecological model, community development and action research principles. Result(s):
  Seven emerging collaborative processes based on effective partnership working, capacity-building
  practice and sustaining health and wellbeing evolved from a partnership between
  a Community Researchers Advisory Group and a Partners Advisory Group. BAME 'community
  connectors' were key to obtaining feedback from 213 women from 16 ethnic groups,
  which influenced the development of bespoke interventions and local sport and physical
  activity long-term policy, as one means of reducing social inequalities for women
  from BAME backgrounds. Conclusion(s): This feasibility study demonstrates the effectiveness
  and limitations of partnership working as a public health tool. The local Sport
  and Physical Activity Alliance and council department worked together to promote
  the sustainability of BAME-focused programmes as part of their governance and policy
  frameworks.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020."
