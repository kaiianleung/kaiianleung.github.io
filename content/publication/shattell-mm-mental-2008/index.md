abstract: Community-based participatory research bridges the gap between academic
  researchers and the real-life issues of communities and offers promise for addressing
  racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care. The purpose of this community-based
  participatory research was to identify factors that affect access, use, and perception
  of mental health services by a Latino population at individual, organizational,
  and community levels. Individual level factors included health beliefs about mental
  illness and care, suspicions of providers, financial concerns, and culturally determined
  gender roles. Organizational factors included problems with access to care related
  to cost, lack of bilingual providers, and culturally competent care; and community
  level factors included distance between resources and the need for services to be
  provided in community sites. Immigration status and acculturation were identified
  as factors at all levels.
