abstract: The Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) was formed as a partnership
  comprised of committed community based organizations (grassroots, service, health
  care organizations) and a National Cancer Institute designated cancer center working
  together to reduce cancer health disparities. Adhering to principles of community-based
  participatory research, TBCCN's primary aims are to develop and sustain outreach,
  training, and research programs that aim to reach medically underserved, multicultural
  and multilingual populations within the Tampa Bay tri-county area. Using a participatory
  evaluation approach, we recently evaluated the partnerships' priorities for cancer
  education and outreach; perspectives on the partnerships' adherence to CBPR principles;
  and suggestions for sustaining TBCCN and its efforts. The purpose of this paper
  is to describe implementation and outcomes of this participatory evaluation of a
  community/academic partnership, and to illustrate the application of evaluation
  findings for partnership capacity-building and sustainability. Our evaluation provides
  evidence for partners' perceived benefits and realized expectations of the partnership
  and illustrates the value of ongoing and continued partnership assessment to directly
  inform program activities and build community capacity and sustainability. Copyright
