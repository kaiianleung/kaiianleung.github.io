abstract: "Background: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of respiratory and
  cardiovascular diseases, and members of Chinese-Canadian communities have been found
  to be at significant risk of excess smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There
  currently exists a lack of culturally relevant smoking-cessation materials for both
  Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities that must be addressed. Objective(s):
  Our study aimed to explore the cultural context of smoking practices and smoking-cessation
  within Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities, and to identify perceived barriers
  and facilitators to successful smoking cessation. We also endeavour to understand
  the acceptance and efficacy of a proposed culturally and linguistically appropriate
  smoking-cessation program. Method(s): A quantitative cross-sectional study was undertaken
  in the form of a community-based exploratory study. Information obtained from this
  research was enriched through consultations with health care and smoking-cessation
  professionals. Focus groups were then conducted with a number of current smokers
  from target communities. This information was then applied during the development
  of a series of culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials.
  Result(s): Our study qualitatively assessed factors influencing smoking onset, continuation
  and cessation amongst respondents (n = 168). Access to cigarettes and a general
  cultural approval of smoking played an important role in participants' smoking-onset.
  For male participants, familial and peer influence was perceived as a major factor
  for smoking continuation, while females claimed stress to be the greatest determinant.
  For younger smokers, smoking-cessation information delivery is critical and must
  account for their specific smoking patterns. Younger people responded they were
  not heavily influenced by pictorial warnings on cigarette packages, but would be
  influenced by social media trends and broadcasts. Older smokers often attempted
  quitting multiple times but struggled to maintain cessation. Participants were more
  willing to discuss individual smoking habits with a consultant from their culture,
  who spoke their language and understood cultural norms pertaining to smoking practices.
  Conclusion(s): Increasing access to and standard of culturally relevant smoking-cessation
  materials and programs may lead to an increase in smoking-cessation practices. Engaging
  community members and professionals during the development and implementation of
  culturally and linguistically comprehensive smoking-cessation interventions may
  facilitate behavioural modifications and changes in smoking habits within ethnic
  minority communities."
