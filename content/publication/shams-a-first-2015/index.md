abstract: 'Introduction: Cultural and community specific barriers were identified
  as reasons for low bystander CPR/AED rates in minorities. No literature exists that
  explores this issue in the Arab American population, a large ethnic community in
  the state. Method(s): We performed a cross sectional survey of clients receiving
  services from ACCESS (Arab Community Center for Economic & Social Services), the
  largest Arabic nonprofit organization in Michigan, during a 3 month period. The
  survey was presented verbally or in writing in English/Arabic. The questions were
  regarding demographics, CPR/AED knowledge, barriers to CPR training, and how best
  to inform and train respondents. A 5 point Likert scale was used and descriptive
  statistics are presented. Result(s): Of 434 potential respondents, 192(44.3%) completed
  the survey. Respondents were majority female (58%), adult (mean age 37) and first
  generation immigrant (73.9%). They were low income (66% textless $30K/year) and
  well educated (65% textgreater H.S. education). They were predominantly Muslims
  (81%), 23.8% lacked English proficiency, and 42% completed the survey in Arabic.
  About a third (30.4%) had prior CPR training. The vast majority (83.8%) support
  public CPR education and performance, with 63.1% believing they are currently capable
  of understanding and implementing CPR instructions given over the phone. Perceived
  barriers to CPR performance are listed in Table 1. The most common barrier to learning
  CPR was availability of nearby CPR courses (17.4%). Respondents identified the Internet
  as their preferred source of information and community centers as their preferred
  site for CPR training. Conclusion(s): Members of the Arabic community are aware
  of the importance of bystander CPR/AED and are willing to learn and perform CPR.
  Language and female chest exposure are two specific issues to address when designing
  community specific CPR/AED program. Internet and community center based initiative
  were preferred sites for educational programs.'
