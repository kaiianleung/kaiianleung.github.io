abstract: "Background: Research-based interventions for Canadian immigrant groups
  are usually developed without input from the people receiving the intervention.
  We need to design culturally and linguistically appropriate health education interventions
  as existing information materials on asthma for different cultural and language
  communities are not geared toward these ethno-cultural groups in Canada. Objective(s):
  Our study was a community-based participatory research project which aimed to assess
  immigrants' knowledge on asthma within Chinese and Punjabi communities living in
  BC, Canada. Method(s): A series of \\\"knowledge\\\" and \\\"community\\\" videos
  and \\\"pictorial pamphlets\\\" were created from group activities and shared information
  by key-informants, community members, and the research team. The Community videos
  were role played by asthma patients and their families. The knowledge videos were
  developed by two physicians from each of the involved communities. The videos were
  developed in Mandarin, Cantonese and Punjabi, with English subtitles. The pamphlets
  were prepared in the community languages and English. The participants were assigned
  at random to one of four groups: Group1 viewed the knowledge video, Group2 viewed
  the community video, Group3 viewed both videos, and Group4 read the printed educational
  pamphlet only. Result(s): 81 adults with physician-diagnosed asthma (40 Chinese
  and 41 Punjabi aged 19 to 78 including 39 male and 42 female; from which 21 spoke
  Cantonese, 19 Mandarin, and 41 Punjabi) participated in the study. Preliminary analyses
  showed patients' overall knowledge about asthma causes and triggers was improved
  significantly from pretest to follow-up post-test in all language groups. However,
  no significant differences were identified among intervention groups. Patients reported
  their intention to properly manage their asthma, following participation in this
  study. The areas of involvement, as reported by more than 64% of the participants,
  were: \\\"following doctor's instruction to manage asthma\\\", \\\"how to avoid
  asthma triggers\\\", and \\\"take medication properly and regularly\\\". Major reasons
  for understanding and following the information provided in the education materials,
  as reported by over 65% of the participants, were that information was in their
  own language and provided by people from their own community. Conclusion(s): We
  highlight the importance of patients understanding information and their adherence
  with physician instruction to manage their asthma while receiving education that
  is culturally and linguistically relevant. The implications of these findings are
  important when taking into consideration that \\\"language and cultural discordance\\\
  \" between health care provider and patient has been shown by several researchers
  to be associated with lower patient compliance and poor health outcomes."
