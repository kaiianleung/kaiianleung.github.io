abstract: Summary Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore and describe Khmer
  mothers' understanding of HBV and HPV prevention as well as their perception of
  parenting on health and health education of their daughters in the US. Methods The
  qualitative pilot study guided by the revised Network Episode Model and informed
  by ethnographic analysis and community-based purposive sampling method were used.
  Face-to-face audiotaped interviews with eight Khmer mothers were conducted by bilingual
  female middle-aged community health leaders who spoke Khmer. Results The findings
  revealed that Khmer mothers clearly lacked knowledge about HBV and HPV infection
  prevention and had difficulty understanding and educating their daughters about
  health behavior, especially on sex-related topics. The findings showed that histo-sociocultural
  factors are integrated with the individual factor, and these factors influenced
  the HBV and HPV knowledge and perspective of Khmer mothers' parenting. Conclusions
  The study suggests that situation-specific conceptual and methodological approaches
  that take into account the uniqueness of the sociocultural context of CAs is a novel
  method for identifying factors that are significant in shaping the perception of
  Khmer mothers' health education related to HBV and HPV prevention among their daughters.
  The communication between mother and daughter about sex and the risk involved in
  contracting HBV and HPV has been limited, partly because it is seen as a \"taboo
  subject\" and partly because mothers think that schools educate their children regarding
  sexuality and health.Copyright Â© 2015, Korean Society of Nursing Science.
