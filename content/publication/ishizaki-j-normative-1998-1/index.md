abstract: We investigated community-based data of the Mini-Mental State Examination
  (MMSE) scores of elderly residents along with the effects of age and educational
  level. MMSE was planned for all residents over 65 years of age in a town in northern
  Japan. The number of elders who took the MMSE was 2,266 (90%). The score significantly
  declined with age and lower educational level, although no effect of sex was apparent.
  For the MMSE subitems, all the values except for that of naming showed effects of
  both age and educational level. Those screened by MMSE who fell in the range of
  cognitive impairment (textless 24) accounted for 21.8% and those with severe cognitive
  impairment (textless 18) constituted 6.0%. Despite the differences in language and
  culture, the mean scores are remarkably similar between Japan and other countries.
  This is the first normative, community-based study of MMSE among elderly adults
  in Japan.
