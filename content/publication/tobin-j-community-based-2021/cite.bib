 abstract = {Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based meditation interventions (MBMIs) among Latino youth. Furthermore, joint parent-child participation in such programs is rare. Utilizing a community-based participatory research approach, this study evaluated the feasibility of a pilot bilingual MBMI among Latino adolescents and their parents in Los Angeles. Qualitative interviews were conducted to assess the practicality, implementation, and acceptability of the program. Challenges to attendance included health issues or conflicts with work. Several adolescents struggled with distractions from peers. However, overall responses suggest that parents and children found the program convenient and enjoyable, and perceived benefits from the curriculum. This study supports the feasibility of a MBMI among Latino family dyads.},
