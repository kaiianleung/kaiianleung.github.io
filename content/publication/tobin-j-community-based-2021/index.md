abstract: Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based meditation
  interventions (MBMIs) among Latino youth. Furthermore, joint parent-child participation
  in such programs is rare. Utilizing a community-based participatory research approach,
  this study evaluated the feasibility of a pilot bilingual MBMI among Latino adolescents
  and their parents in Los Angeles. Qualitative interviews were conducted to assess
  the practicality, implementation, and acceptability of the program. Challenges to
  attendance included health issues or conflicts with work. Several adolescents struggled
  with distractions from peers. However, overall responses suggest that parents and
  children found the program convenient and enjoyable, and perceived benefits from
  the curriculum. This study supports the feasibility of a MBMI among Latino family
  dyads.
