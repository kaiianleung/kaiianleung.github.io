 abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: There is strong evidence that physical activity and adequate nutrition are important protective factors against type 2 diabetes, but these are linked to culture and socio-economic status. This study explores the traditional culture of the Pukapuka people living in the Illawarra region of New South Wales and how migration to the region has affected their lifestyle, health and well-being. METHOD(S): The study used an action research approach, including focus groups, planning workshops, reflection sessions and collaborative evaluation of interventions. Twenty-four adults (13 women and 11 men) from the Pukapuka community were recruited. RESULT(S): Participants increased their understanding of the relationship between lifestyle and health status, increased rates of physical activity, and enhanced their sense of self-efficacy. CONCLUSION(S): The study shows that action research methods can be used effectively to influence behaviour changes in small, culturally and linguistically diverse communities.},
