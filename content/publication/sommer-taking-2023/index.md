abstract: There is a growing global interest in puberty and early adolescence and
  the importance of ensuring young people have the information and support they need
  during this critical phase of transition in the life course. This article highlights
  an adaptable model being used to support the development of contextually appropriate
  puberty education, in the form of illustrated and often bilingual books, for early
  adolescent girls and boys in countries around the world. This youth-centered participatory
  research and design model, which relies on the generation of community and government
  partnerships, has been employed in 10 countries thus far. Valuable learning has
  been documented from various contexts, including the approach's flexibility in adapting
  to the inputs of government and community members, incorporating local buy-in as
  a key ingredient for sustainability, using in-country experts for social and cultural
  appropriateness of illustrations and translations, and ensuring that the authentic
  youth voices captured through the participatory data collection and field-testing
  shape the educational content. The continuous integration of insights and perceptions
  of adults who influence young people's lives into the development process is also
  essential to enabling the uptake of puberty content in each new country. Parents,
  educators, youth service providers, and government officials are often the gatekeepers
  to young adolescents receiving puberty content and are thus critical to the process.
  This review of more than a decade of experience using this model underscores the
  essentiality of 2 key components-local partnership and participatory data collection-and
  highlights the importance of flexible approaches that are adapted to the unique
  sociocultural and environmental conditions in each country context. Copyright Â©
