abstract: "Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine whether culturally
  diverse adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health care behaviors
  is associated with the following social and cognitive variables: health self-efficacy,
  value placed on health, perceived barriers to health promotion, and perceptions
  regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care
  behaviors.Procedure: A cross-sectional study involving 108 high school students
  in health education classes was conducted. The majority of these participants (59.3%)
  identified as a racial minority, and 68% of these participants were female.Results:
  Health self-efficacy, value placed on health, and perceptions regarding primary
  caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care practices were all
  significantly correlated with the participating adolescents' self-reported engagement
  in preventative health care behaviors. Primary caregivers' and peers' engagement
  in preventative health care behaviors emerged as significant predictors of the participating
  adolescents' preventative health care behaviors.Conclusions: Present findings suggest
  that family and peers are likely role models for adolescents in the area of preventative
  health care behaviors. Thus, interventions to promote these behaviors among adolescents
  similar to those in the present study need to be family, school, and community-based."
