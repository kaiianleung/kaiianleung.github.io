abstract: "CONTEXT: Primarily because of immigration, Asian Americans are one of the
  fastest growing and most ethnically diverse minority groups in the United States.
  However, little is known about their perspectives on health care quality., OBJECTIVE:
  To examine factors contributing to quality of care from the perspective of Chinese-
  and Vietnamese-American patients with limited English language skills., DESIGN:
  Qualitative study using focus groups and content analysis to determine domains of
  quality of care., SETTING: Four community health centers in Massachusetts., PARTICIPANTS:
  A total of 122 Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients were interviewed in focus
  groups by bilingual interviewers using a standardized, translated moderator guide.,
  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Domains of quality of care mentioned by patients in verbatim
  transcripts., RESULTS: In addition to dimensions of health care quality commonly
  expressed by Caucasian, English-speaking patients in the United States, Chinese-
  and Vietnamese-American patients with limited English proficiency wanted to discuss
  the use of non-Western medical practices with their providers, but encountered significant
  barriers. They viewed providers' knowledge, inquiry, and nonjudgmental acceptance
  of traditional Asian medical beliefs and practices as part of quality care. Patients
  also considered the quality of interpreter services to be very important. They preferred
  using professional interpreters rather than family members, and preferred gender-concordant
  translators. Furthermore, they expressed the need for help in navigating health
  care systems and obtaining support services., CONCLUSIONS: Cultural and linguistically
  appropriate health care services may lead to improved health care quality for Asian-American
  patients who have limited English language skills. Important aspects of quality
  include providers' respect for traditional health beliefs and practices, access
  to professional interpreters, and assistance in obtaining social services."
