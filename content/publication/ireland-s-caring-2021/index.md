abstract: "Background & problem: Birthing On Country (BOC) is an international movement
  for returning childbirth to First Nations peoples and their communities. The RISE
  Framework was developed to guide evidence-based BOC implementation but has not yet
  been tested in a remote Australian community setting. Aim(s): To test the transferability
  and acceptability of the RISE Framework in a remote multilingual setting in a Yolnu
  (First Nations) community in Northern Australia. Method(s): Working in partnership
  with one remote Yolnu community, we used a decolonising participatory action research
  (D-PAR) approach to begin co-designing services and test the acceptability of the
  RISE Framework. A three-phased transferability process was developed: Warming the
  ground; Co-Interpreting; and Acceptability Testing. Finding(s): The RISE Framework
  was customized to the local Yolnu context and called 'Caring for Mum on Country'.
  It was articulated in two languages: Djambarrpuynu and English. We successfully
  used it to guide discussions at a community gathering privileging the voices of
  senior women to inform the design of local maternity services. Discussion(s): Using
  the D-PAR approach, the RISE Framework was readily adapatable to this complex, remote
  and multilingual setting. It resonated with the Yolnu community and proved useful
  for identifying current limitations of existing maternity services and importantly
  facilitating the design of Yolnu centred strength-based maternity services. Conclusion(s):
  The RISE Framework, combined with our transformative methodology, offers a promising
  approach to guiding complex interventions for returning services to First Nations
  communities in diverse contexts. Testing in other settings will further contribute
  to growing an evidence-base for BOC service planning and implementation.Copyright
