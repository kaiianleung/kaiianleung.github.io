abstract: With the belief that diversity is strength, the community of Reading, Pennsylvania,
  set forth an effort to meet the challenges of the disparity within the local nursing
  workforce with a comprehensive, long-term approach for the recruitment and retention
  of an underrepresented group. An academic-community partnership was formed to develop
  multifaceted programs and support across school and community agency systems. The
  Alvernia College Nursing Department has taken a leadership role to coordinate many
  community and health care agencies with the goal of increasing the number of baccalaureate-prepared
  Hispanic and bilingual nurses to provide culturally competent and sensitive care
  to the community.
