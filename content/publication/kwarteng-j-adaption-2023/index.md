abstract: 'Background. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Wisconsin with
  higher mortality rates observed for Black/African American (B/AA) and Hispanic/Latino
  (H/L) communities. However, programs tailored to the interests of communities most
  impacted by cancer AND made available to the general population are lacking. In
  this project, we adapted the Moving Forward program for African American cancer
  survivors which included a program workbook, in-person education/supervised exercise
  classes and text messaging. We targeted two adaptations to inform a cancer prevention
  program available to the public through a public recreation system: 1) tailoring
  to include non-cancer affected individuals and 2) extending to meet the needs of
  the H/L community. Methods. This project was facilitated through partnerships between
  an academic cancer center, the Milwaukee public recreation system (MKE Rec) and
  the WI Department of Health and Human Services. We also engaged a community advisory
  board (CAB). Our approach comprised focus groups, surveys collected at community
  events, and an After-Action Review of a 4-week program pilot (2 groups, English
  or Spanish language). Translation was conducted using a forward/back translation
  process with workbook review by individuals from different Spanish language backgrounds.
  Our CAB contributed to the development and review of all study procedures and materials.
  Result(s): 42 H/L community members participated through two focus groups (1 English
  language, [N=4]), 1 Spanish language (N=6)], 16 surveys, and 16 pilot participants
  (N=9 Spanish language, N=7 English language). Adaptations targeted program content
  and materials, as well as program implementation/sustainability within MKE Rec.
  Program adaptations included: 1) integrating information on basic cancer biology;
  2) explaining associations between cancer, lifestyle and other risk factors; 3)
  adding cancer screening information; 4) including cooking demonstrations and recipes
  with culturally relevant tips; 5) updating workbook images and content to reflect
  the diversity of local communities; and 6) addressing comorbidity risk. Key adaptations
  related to conducting and sustaining within a public recreation system included:
  1) creating a standardized instructor training and manual; 2) dividing the program
  into two 8-week sessions to meet the public recreation system program calendar;
  3) eliminating the text message component; 4) providing the program workbook and
  classes in English and Spanish; and 5) integrating different exercise approaches
  to meet needs/interests of different age groups, genders, and different fitness
  levels. The adapted program, Total Wellness/Bienestar Total, is now offered as the
  first ever Spanish language wellness class within MKE Rec. Conclusion(s): Community-academic
  partnerships and ongoing community engagement led to meaningful adaptations to a
  cancer prevention and lifestyle program. These efforts leverage a public resource
  and can impact disparities by making widely available cancer prevention and lifestyle
  support.'
