abstract: 'This exploratory study assessed the use of functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) to examine hemodynamic response patterns during sentence processing. Four
  groups of participants: monolingual English children, bilingual Chinese-English
  children, bilingual Chinese-English adults and monolingual English adults were given
  an agent selection syntactic processing task. Bilingual child participants were
  classified as simultaneous or sequential bilinguals to examine the impact of first
  language, age of second-language acquisition (AoL2A), and the length of second language
  experience on behavioral performance and cortical activation. Participants were
  asked to select the agent of four types of sentences: subject-verb-object (SVO),
  passive (PAS), subject-extracted relative clause (SR), and object-extracted relative
  clause (OR) adopted from the \"Whatdunit\" task by Montgomery et al. (2016). Semantic
  cues were removed by using inanimate nouns for agents and patients, which constrained
  participants to make decisions based on syntactic knowledge. Behavioral results
  showed greater accuracy for canonical SVO and SR sentence types than for noncanonical
  OR and PAS sentence types, which aligns with prior studies. Neuroimaging results
  revealed greater hemodynamic responses to relative clauses (i.e., SR and OR sentences)
  than to simple sentences (SVO and PAS), especially for Chinese-English bilinguals
  suggesting first-language transfer influencing sentence processing in English. The
  effects AoL2A and the length of second language experience showed no significant
  differences between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals or between bilingual
  adults and children for identifying the correct agent in each sentence. However,
  neuroimaging results demonstrated greater hemodynamic responses in right dorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in simultaneous
  bilinguals compared to sequential bilinguals and greater hemodynamic responses in
  left and right DLPFC and left IPL among bilingual adults. Different behavioral and
  neural hemodynamic response patterns afford new insights into the effects of syntactic
  knowledge on sentence processing. Copyright Â© 2021 Ding, Mohr, Orellana, Hancock,
