 abstract = {CONTEXT: A paucity of literature describes the growing Chinese American community's end-of-life (EOL) priorities and preferences. OBJECTIVE(S): Develop a culturally-tailored advance care planning (ACP) tool to understand the EOL preferences of this underserved minority group. METHOD(S): Informed by the Cultural Appropriateness Theory, the Chinese American Coalition for Compassionate Care (CACCC) developed Heart to Heart (HTH) Cards using a 3-step approach. First, CACCC created and refined a list of bilingual, culturally relevant EOL issues. Next, CACCC organized the EOL issues into a card deck. Finally, CACCC developed a unique playstyle of the cards-the HTH Cafe. From 2014-2019, CACCC recruited Chinese American volunteers and participants for HTH Cafes. Following each Cafe, participants completed an anonymous survey describing their sociodemographics, top 3 cards, and cafe evaluation. RESULT(S): The 54 HTH Cards were organized into 4 suits (spiritual, physical, financial/legal, and social). Each card displayed a culturally-tailored EOL issue in English and Chinese. Playstyles included one-on-one and group formats (ie. HTH Cafe). CACCC volunteers conducted 316 HTH Cafes for 2,267 Chinese American adults. Most participants were female (61.6%), between 18-50 years old (56.7%), lived in California (80.2%) and born in Asia (74.3%). The top priority (25.5%) was "If I'm going to die anyway, I don't want to be kept alive by machines." Participants thought the session was pleasant (99.5%) and expressed intent to complete advance directives (86.5%). CONCLUSION(S): HTH Cards represents the first, theory-driven, culturally-tailored ACP tool for Chinese Americans. More research is needed to establish its impact on ACP conversations and outcomes.},
