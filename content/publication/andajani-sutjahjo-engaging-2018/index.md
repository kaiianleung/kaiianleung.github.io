abstract: This article discusses the experiences of community volunteers' participation
  in a community-based participatory research project in Tāmaki, a low socio-economic
  and ethnically diverse suburban community within greater Auckland City, New Zealand.
  In the Tāmaki Community Action Research project, community volunteers were recruited
  and trained to conduct random household surveys (RHS) and asset mapping commissioned
  by community groups and government agencies in that area. The volunteers were involved
  in planning, coordination and ongoing governance of the project and ~70 residents
  and local university students participated at different stages of the 2-year project.
  Over 600 RHS were completed and the volunteers' experiences were recorded in field
  notes, informal group discussions, daily team meetings and individual interviews
  and form the basis of this article. Only their experiences are discussed here, not
  the survey results which will be presented elsewhere. The project reflected the
  inherent asset-rich nature of the community via examples of individual volunteer
  empowerment and collective social/community capacity building. Volunteers increased
  their interpersonal and organizational skills, their understanding of the complexity
  of their community's logistics and cultural diversity, and gained an increased sense
  of community purpose and commitment. There was very strong endorsement of culturally
  sensitive research practice to recognize cultural differences and to engage productively
  within their richly ethnically diverse community. Full community volunteer participation
  in the project's governance (i.e. through design, training, implementation and ongoing
  consultation/management phases) was considered key to sustaining the life of project.
