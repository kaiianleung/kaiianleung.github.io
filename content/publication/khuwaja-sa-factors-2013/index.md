abstract: This study explored post-migration experiences of recently migrated Pakistani
  Muslim adolescent females residing in the United States. In-depth, semi-structured
  interviews were conducted with thirty Pakistani Muslim adolescent females between
  the ages of 15 and 18 years living with their families in Houston, Texas. Data obtained
  from the interviews were evaluated using discourse analysis to identify major reoccurring
  themes. Participants discussed factors associated with the process of adaptation
  to the American culture. The results revealed that the main factors associated with
  adaptation process included positive motivation for migration, family bonding, social
  support networks, inter-familial communication, aspiration of adolescents to learn
  other cultures, availability of English-as-second-language programs, participation
  in community rebuilding activities, and faith practices, English proficiency, peer
  pressure, and inter-generational conflicts. This study provided much needed information
  on factors associated with adaptation process of Pakistani Muslim adolescent females
  in the United States. The results have important implications for improving the
  adaptation process of this group and offer potential directions for intervention
  and counseling services.
