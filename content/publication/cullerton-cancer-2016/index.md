abstract: "Issue addressed: Screening for cancer of the cervix, breast and bowel can
  reduce morbidity and mortality. Low participation rates in cancer screening have
  been identified among migrant communities internationally. Attempting to improve
  low rates of cancer screening, the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland developed
  a pilot Cancer Screening Education Program for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.
  This study determines the impact of education sessions on knowledge, attitudes and
  intentions to participate in screening for culturally and linguistically diverse
  (CALD) communities living in Brisbane, Queensland.Methods: Seven CALD groups (Arabic-speaking,
  Bosnian, South Asian (including Indian and Bhutanese), Samoan and Pacific Island,
  Spanish-speaking, Sudanese and Vietnamese) participated in a culturally-tailored
  cancer screening education pilot program that was developed using the Health Belief
  Model. A pre- and post-education evaluation session measured changes in knowledge,
  attitudes and intention related to breast, bowel and cervical cancer and screening.
  The evaluation focussed on perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness and the
  target population's beliefs about reducing risk by cancer screening.Results: There
  were 159 participants in the three cancer screening education sessions. Overall
  participants' knowledge increased, some attitudes toward participation in cancer
  screening became more positive and intent to participate in future screening increased
  (n=146).Conclusion: These results indicate the importance of developing screening
  approaches that address the barriers to participation among CALD communities and
  that a culturally-tailored education program is effective in improving knowledge,
  attitudes about and intentions to participate in cancer screening.So what?: It is
  important that culturally-tailored programs are developed in conjunction with communities
  to improve health outcomes."
