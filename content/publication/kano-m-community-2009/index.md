abstract: "In 2005, New Mexico implemented a unique reform in managed behavioral health
  services that seeks to ensure delivery of consumer-driven, recovery-oriented care
  to low-income individuals. Distinguishing features of the reform are the Local Collaboratives
  (LCs), regionally based community organizations designed by state government to
  represent behavioral health concerns of New Mexico's diverse cultural populations.
  We examine community response to the LCs, focusing on two broad sets of themes derived
  from 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork. The first set--structure and function--encompasses
  several issues: predominance of provider versus consumer voice; insufficient resources
  to support internal operations; imposition of state administrative demands; and
  perceived lack of state response to LC efforts. The second set--participation and
  collaboration--reveals how problems of information flow and other logistical factors
  impact involvement in LCs and how the construction of \\\"community\\\" introduced
  under this initiative exacerbates tensions across localities with varied histories
  and populations."
