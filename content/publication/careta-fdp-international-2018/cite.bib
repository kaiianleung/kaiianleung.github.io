 abstract = {Introduction and Objectives: In the realm of bleeding disorders (BD), knowledge translation (KT) is a constant challenge. Patients without an adequate understanding of their disease are not aware of the mechanisms of the pathology, treatment options, and the importance of treatment. A good use of Information and communication technologies (ICT) could help remedy this problem. This project intends to facilitate KT pertaining to the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of BD, prognosis, treatment options and the importance of treatment for patients with coagulopathies; and to give patients from NMOs around the world the opportunity to further develop their understanding of their pathology, making them patient experts who will be able to help educate their peers. Material(s) and Method(s): After a survey of the most important concepts relating to BD, a series of 5 minute YouTube videos will be developed. These videos will be hosted on a website named the International Hemophilia Knowledge Translation Program (HemoKT). It will contain a community-driven wiki, a forum, useful links and a FAQ page. This material will be developed by two hemophilia patients (both authors). The website will be translated into multiple languages by collaborating hemophilia patients in different regions of the world. All video content in each different language will be reviewed by qualified hematologists who will be identified on the website. Result(s): This is an ongoing project. Two videos on hemophilia and three on von Willebrand disease have already been produced and have been published on YouTube. The videos total 3,719 views; 57% of the views were by males; the age group that most viewed included between 35 and 44 years, followed by the population aged 25 to 34 years, and the population aged 45 to 54 years. Conclusion(s): The high number of views obtained for the first videos demonstrate that there is a need for KT in the BD community, and that engaged and informed patients are well positioned to accomplish this task using ICT. During the 2018 World Congress, the project team will present the first version of the HemoKT website (in Portuguese and English) and current statistics.},
