abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether exposure to
  a second language in bilingual families influences the spoken German skills after
  cochlear implantation. A further question was how many children with migration background
  are bilingual., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review., SETTING: Tertiary referral
  center; cochlear implant program., PATIENTS: Ninety-three profoundly hearing-impaired
  children; 52 of these children reside in bilingual and 41 in monolingual homes.,
  INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation before the age of 6 years, speech and language
  skills assessments., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standard speech perception and receptive
  and expressive language measures. Data on used primary and secondary languages were
  obtained by questionnaire., RESULTS: Children growing up in bilingual homes performed
  worse than children from monolingual homes in all performed speech tests. Almost
  all children with bilingual parents indicated German as their main language. In
  some cases, the second language is used actively, but in most children, the use
  is limited to single words and expressions. However, some children from bilingual
  homes achieve high skill level in German language and, furthermore, develop competency
  in second spoken language., CONCLUSION: Advanced language skills including the learning
  of a second spoken language are possible for children with cochlear implant living
  in bilingual homes, but that is the exception rather than the rule. It seems that
  other factors, such as spoken German language skills of the parents, integration
  of the family, and compliance with the rehabilitation program, play an important
  role. Therefore, a special support for children with cochlear implants from bilingual
  homes is needed.'
