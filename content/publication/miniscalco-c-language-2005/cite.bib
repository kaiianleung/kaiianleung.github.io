 abstract = {This study concerns language outcome in 6-y-old children who participated in a longitudinal community-based study of 105 children screened for language delay (LD) at 2 1/2 y of age. The purpose was to investigate (1) whether results from the 2 1/2-y screening were persistent at 6 y of age, and (2) what language domains at age 6 were difficult for (a) children with LD at age 2 1/2 y and (b) children with normal language (LN) at the same age. Significant differences between LD and LN at age 2 1/2 y were persistent at age 6. The vulnerability that was identified at 2 1/2 y of age, such as problems with going from single-word utterances to multiword utterances, seems to persist as delayed development at different language levels and across language domains. Conclusion(s): This study has shown that children who failed the 2 1/2-y screening are at high risk of having persistent language problems at age 6 y. Â© 2005 Taylor & Francis.},
