abstract: 'This study concerns language outcome in 6-y-old children who participated
  in a longitudinal community-based study of 105 children screened for language delay
  (LD) at 2 1/2 y of age. The purpose was to investigate (1) whether results from
  the 2 1/2-y screening were persistent at 6 y of age, and (2) what language domains
  at age 6 were difficult for (a) children with LD at age 2 1/2 y and (b) children
  with normal language (LN) at the same age. Significant differences between LD and
  LN at age 2 1/2 y were persistent at age 6. The vulnerability that was identified
  at 2 1/2 y of age, such as problems with going from single-word utterances to multiword
  utterances, seems to persist as delayed development at different language levels
  and across language domains. Conclusion(s): This study has shown that children who
  failed the 2 1/2-y screening are at high risk of having persistent language problems
  at age 6 y. Â© 2005 Taylor & Francis.'
