 abstract = {Latinos with serious mental illness get sick and die much younger than other adults. In this paper, we review findings of a community based participatory research project meant to identify important healthcare needs, barriers to these needs, solutions to the barriers, and the promise of peer navigators as a solution. Findings from focus groups reflected general concerns of people with mental illness (e.g., insurance, engagement, accessibility) and Latinos with serious mental illness (e.g., immigration, language, and family). Feedback and analyses especially focused on the potential of peer navigators. Implications of these findings for integrated care of Latinos with serious mental illness are discussed.},
