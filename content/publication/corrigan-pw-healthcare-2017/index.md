abstract: Latinos with serious mental illness get sick and die much younger than other
  adults. In this paper, we review findings of a community based participatory research
  project meant to identify important healthcare needs, barriers to these needs, solutions
  to the barriers, and the promise of peer navigators as a solution. Findings from
  focus groups reflected general concerns of people with mental illness (e.g., insurance,
  engagement, accessibility) and Latinos with serious mental illness (e.g., immigration,
  language, and family). Feedback and analyses especially focused on the potential
  of peer navigators. Implications of these findings for integrated care of Latinos
  with serious mental illness are discussed.
