abstract: Objective. To assess the acceptability for use of information on osteomalacia
  for South Asian patients. Methods. Ten focus groups of South Asian persons speaking
  Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu (one male and one female group for each
  language) were used to evaluate the written (leaflets) and spoken information (CD)
  on osteomalacia for South Asian patients produced by the Arthritis Research Campaign
  (ARC). Focus group discussion was facilitated by community-based workers using the
  Social Action Research Method. A subsidiary evaluation of the information was conducted
  by a questionnaire-based survey sent to British Society of Rheumatology/ British
  Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BSR/BHPR) members and others who had requested
  such materials from ARC in the past. Results. Evaluation by focus groups revealed
  that there were potential difficulties relating to the understanding of the information
  leaflets and CDs and problematic issues regarding the quality of translation and
  pronunciation. Evaluation by BSR/BHPR members and others who had requested such
  material was that although the information was culturally appropriate, there were
  some weak areas such as mispronunciation, the quality of translation and specific
  customs. Conclusion. Healthcare information resources for minority ethnic groups
  has traditionally been developed depending upon the needs of the community, the
  language spoken and cultural norms. Such information is regarded as 'culturally
  sensitive'. However, an additional dimension is required. Information should be
  evaluated by the community and also specific users in order to determine its acceptability.
  This test of 'cultural competence' can ensure that such information has real practical
  value. An iterative evaluation process with feedback and refinement of information
  resources for minority ethnic groups is essential. Â© The Author 2009. Published
