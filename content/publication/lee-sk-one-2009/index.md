abstract: "Background: Consumer participation in primary health care is important
  in providing quality consumer-focused care, but challenging when working with disadvantaged
  groups of diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Women's Health Services (WHS)
  works with women from over 60 different nationalities, including many newly arrived
  migrants and refugees. New arrivals access a wide range of WHS programmes including
  medical services, counselling, information, community talks and workshops, referral,
  and outreach, but few ethnic women attended the alcohol and other drug (AOD) services
  offered by the organisation. Aim(s): To establish an active consumer reference group
  to assist understanding and reducing the barriers to AOD services for a heterogeneous
  disadvantaged group that includes individuals from different cultural, language
  and educational backgrounds. Result(s): Leaning heavily on experiences from the
  mental health field, WHS overcame many practical and philosophical considerations
  which included: agreeing upon the purpose of the group and how it would operate
  within the structure of the organisation; the level of English language required
  by participants for the group to function; issues of resourcing the group; and ensuring
  an appropriate, workable demographic mix in terms of age, language, and migration
  experiences. Conclusion(s): The process and the outcome of establishing a consumer
  reference group (CRG) in a primary healthcare setting has been valuable for consumers'
  and health service providers within the organisation. Â© 2009 Radcliffe Publishing."
