abstract: Aims and ObjectivesThis study was designed to assess whether bilingual caregivers,
  compared to monolingual caregivers, modify their nonverbal gestures to match the
  increased communicative and/or cognitive-linguistic demands of bilingual language
  contexts - as would be predicted based on the Facilitative Strategy Hypothesis.MethodologyWe
  recorded the rate of gestures (i.e., representational and beat gestures) in monolingual
  and bilingual caregivers when they retold a cartoon story to their child or to an
  adult, in a monolingual and a bilingual context (‘synonym’ context for monolingual
  caregivers).Data and AnalysisWe calculated the frequency of all gestures, representational
  gestures, and beat gestures for each addressee (adult-directed vs. toddler-directed)
  and linguistic context (monolingual vs. bilingual/synonym), separately for the monolingual
  and the bilingual caregivers. Using Linear Mixed Models, we contrasted monolingual
  vs. bilingual caregivers’ gesture frequency.Findings/ConclusionsBilingual caregivers
  gesture more than monolingual caregivers, irrespective of addressee and language
  context. Furthermore, we found evidence in support of the Facilitative Strategy
  hypothesis across both monolingual and bilingual caregivers, as all caregivers increased
  the rate of their representational gestures in the child-directed re-telling. Furthermore,
  both bilingual and monolingual caregivers used more gestures in the context of increased
  communicative demands (bilingual context or using synonyms for monolingual caregivers).OriginalityTo
  our knowledge, this is the first study of gesture use in child-directed communication
  in monolingual and bilingual caregivers.Significance/ImplicationsIndependent of
  their monolingual or bilingual status, caregivers adjust their multimodal communication
  strategies (specifically gestures) when interacting with their children. Furthermore,
  both monolingual and bilingual caregivers increase their gesture rate when communicative
  demands are higher.
