 abstract = {Aims and ObjectivesThis study was designed to assess whether bilingual caregivers, compared to monolingual caregivers, modify their nonverbal gestures to match the increased communicative and/or cognitive-linguistic demands of bilingual language contexts - as would be predicted based on the Facilitative Strategy Hypothesis.MethodologyWe recorded the rate of gestures (i.e., representational and beat gestures) in monolingual and bilingual caregivers when they retold a cartoon story to their child or to an adult, in a monolingual and a bilingual context (‘synonym’ context for monolingual caregivers).Data and AnalysisWe calculated the frequency of all gestures, representational gestures, and beat gestures for each addressee (adult-directed vs. toddler-directed) and linguistic context (monolingual vs. bilingual/synonym), separately for the monolingual and the bilingual caregivers. Using Linear Mixed Models, we contrasted monolingual vs. bilingual caregivers’ gesture frequency.Findings/ConclusionsBilingual caregivers gesture more than monolingual caregivers, irrespective of addressee and language context. Furthermore, we found evidence in support of the Facilitative Strategy hypothesis across both monolingual and bilingual caregivers, as all caregivers increased the rate of their representational gestures in the child-directed re-telling. Furthermore, both bilingual and monolingual caregivers used more gestures in the context of increased communicative demands (bilingual context or using synonyms for monolingual caregivers).OriginalityTo our knowledge, this is the first study of gesture use in child-directed communication in monolingual and bilingual caregivers.Significance/ImplicationsIndependent of their monolingual or bilingual status, caregivers adjust their multimodal communication strategies (specifically gestures) when interacting with their children. Furthermore, both monolingual and bilingual caregivers increase their gesture rate when communicative demands are higher.},
