abstract: Hemopoietic stem cells can be used from bone marrow or blood or umbilical
  cord blood of matched siblings or appropriately matched unrelated volunteers. Today,
  large bone marrow registries have been established to help identify volunteer unrelated
  bone marrow donors for patients lacking a family donor. Despite there being almost
  10 million registered potential bone marrow donors (PBMD) worldwide, only 50% of
  white patients have a suitable bone marrow match. Growth in the number of PBMD increases
  the likelihood of finding a compatible donor for a patient. The attitudes and knowledge
  of 250 registered PBMD and 315 not registered PBMD toward bone marrow donation,
  tissues and organs donation, and blood donation were surveyed, using a questionnaire
  with 27 items. Multivariate logistic regression identified gender (females more
  often than males), regular blood donation, having a relative or a friend who has
  already been registered as PBMD, having a relative or a friend who needs bone marrow
  transplantation, family discussion about tissue and organ donation, knowledge about
  bone marrow transplantation, information about bone marrow transplantation, and
  trust in health professionals were independent predictive factors influencing people's
  decision to register as PBMD. Knowledge of these factors is important to target
  recruitment efforts.
