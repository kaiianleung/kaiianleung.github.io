abstract: 'Latinos in the United States have been disproportionately affected by the
  intersecting epidemics of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Using a
  community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to problem identification
  and exploration, a total of 74 Latino men (mean age 22.3, range 18-37) residing
  in an urban city in northwest North Carolina participated in one of eight focus
  groups on sexual health. Among the findings of this study, textgreater75% of participants
  reported Mexico as their country of origin; other participants reported being from
  Central and South American countries. Qualitative data analysis identified 13 themes,
  which were grouped into the following three domains: 1) psychosocial factors identified
  as influencing sexual risk health behaviors; 2) system-level barriers to sexual
  health; and 3) characteristics of potentially effective HIV prevention intervention
  approaches. The study findings suggest that community-based, male-centered interpersonal
  networks that provide individual and group education and skill-building and incorporate
  curanderos (Latino healers) and bilingual experts may be important elements of potentially
  effective intervention approaches to reach Latino men, who have been inaccessible
  to conventional HIV prevention programs.'
