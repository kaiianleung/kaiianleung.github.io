abstract: Latinx people living with HIV (PLWH) experience disparities in health outcomes
  and face unique barriers to care related to language, intersectional stigma, and
  immigration status. We aimed to explore the lived experience of Spanish-speaking
  Latinx PLWH in the non-urban South to better understand how to improve care for
  this minority language population. We conducted semi-structured interviews with
  22 participants (10 men, 10 women, 2 transgender women) who were recruited from
  a Ryan White HIV/AIDS program (RWHAP) and a community-based organization. Almost
  all participants were foreign born. Emerging themes included language barriers,
  cultural differences, inadequate interpreter services, HIV-related and intersectional
  stigma, isolation, and relationships as a source of support. These barriers may
  contribute to disparities in outcomes for Latinx PLWH. New interventions are needed
  to overcome barriers, foster community, and ensure culturally tailored models of
  care. Potential clinic-level interventions include the development of specialized
  training for RWHAP interpreters and inclusion of interpreters in care teams.
