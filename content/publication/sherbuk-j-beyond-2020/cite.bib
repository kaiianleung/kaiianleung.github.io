 abstract = {Latinx people living with HIV (PLWH) experience disparities in health outcomes and face unique barriers to care related to language, intersectional stigma, and immigration status. We aimed to explore the lived experience of Spanish-speaking Latinx PLWH in the non-urban South to better understand how to improve care for this minority language population. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 participants (10 men, 10 women, 2 transgender women) who were recruited from a Ryan White HIV/AIDS program (RWHAP) and a community-based organization. Almost all participants were foreign born. Emerging themes included language barriers, cultural differences, inadequate interpreter services, HIV-related and intersectional stigma, isolation, and relationships as a source of support. These barriers may contribute to disparities in outcomes for Latinx PLWH. New interventions are needed to overcome barriers, foster community, and ensure culturally tailored models of care. Potential clinic-level interventions include the development of specialized training for RWHAP interpreters and inclusion of interpreters in care teams.},
