abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Montagnard refugees, an indigenous multilingual tribal people
  from Vietnam, experience lifestyle changes and post-resettlement challenges in the
  United States that contribute to chronic health conditions. Foundational research
  and health data are lacking. OBJECTIVE(S): We describe the Montagnard Hypertension
  Study, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project documenting chronic
  disease risk. METHOD(S): We developed a Montagnard dictionary of hypertension-specific
  terminology and conducted two focus group discussions (FGD), 131 biological assessments
  (blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, scalp hair and saliva sample
  collection), and 127 behavioral surveys. We implemented two health fairs that offered
  services to the community. LESSONS LEARNED: This is the first study to examine chronic
  disease using a CBPR framework for Montagnard health. We highlight lessons learned
  specific to constituents and their capacities, historical and current conflicts,
  and the iterative processes in CBPR design. CONCLUSION(S): CBPR is a practically
  achievable approach to studying chronic disease risk within indigenous, tribal communities,
  with implications for future research with Asian American subgroups and other minority
  populations.'
