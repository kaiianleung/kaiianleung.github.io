abstract: Spontaneous, task-free, hemodynamic activity of the brain provides useful
  information about its functional organization, as it can describe how different
  brain regions communicate to each other. Neuroimaging studies measuring the spontaneous
  activity of the brain are conducted while the participants are not engaged in a
  particular task or receiving any external stimulation. This approach is particularly
  useful in developmental populations as brain activity can be measured without the
  need for infant compliance and the risks of data contamination due to motion artifacts.
  In this project we sought to i) characterize the intrinsic functional organization
  of the brain in 4-month-old infants and ii) investigate whether bilingualism, as
  a specific environmental factor, could lead to adaptations on functional brain network
  development at this early age. Measures of spontaneous hemodynamic activity were
  acquired in 4-month-old infants (n = 104) during natural sleep using functional
  near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Emphasis was placed on acquiring high-quality
  data that could lead to reproducible results and serve as a valuable resource for
  researchers investigating the developing functional connectome. Copyright Â© 2022.
