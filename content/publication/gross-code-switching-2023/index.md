abstract: "PURPOSE: This study examined the frequency, direction, and structural characteristics
  of code-switching (CS) during narratives by Spanish-English bilingual children with
  and without developmental language disorder (DLD) to determine whether children
  with DLD exhibit unique features in their CS that may inform clinical decision-making.,
  METHOD: Spanish-English bilingual children, aged 4;0-6;11 (years;months), with DLD
  (n = 33) and with typical language development (TLD; n = 33) participated in narrative
  retell and story generation tasks in Spanish and English. Instances of CS were classified
  as between utterance or within utterance; within-utterance CS was coded for type
  of grammatical structure. Children completed the morphosyntax subtests of the Bilingual
  English-Spanish Assessment to assist in identifying DLD and to index Spanish and
  English morphosyntactic proficiency., RESULTS: In analyses examining the contributions
  of both DLD status and Spanish and English proficiency, the only significant effect
  of DLD was on the tendency to engage in between-utterance CS; children with DLD
  were more likely than TLD peers to produce whole utterances in English during the
  Spanish narrative task. Within-utterance CS was related to lower morphosyntax scores
  in the target language, but there was no effect of DLD. Both groups exhibited noun
  insertions as the most frequent type of within-utterance CS. However, children with
  DLD tended to exhibit more determiner and verb insertions than TLD peers and increased
  use of \\\"congruent lexicalization,\\\" that is, CS utterances that integrate content
  and function words from both languages., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce that
  use of CS, particularly within-utterance CS, is a typical bilingual behavior even
  during narrative samples collected in a single-language context. However, language
  difficulties associated with DLD may emerge in how children code-switch, including
  use of between-utterance CS and unique patterns during within-utterance CS. Therefore,
  analyzing CS patterns may contribute to a more complete profile of children's dual-language
  skills during assessment., SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23479574."
