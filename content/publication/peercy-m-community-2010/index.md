abstract: Significant health disparities exist among culturally diverse minority populations
  in the United States. The ways in which healthcare providers recognize and respond
  to this issue is critical. Methods must be effective, culturally appropriate, and
  engage the community if they are to be utilized, and they also need to be sustainable
  to make a significant impact. American Indians and Alaska Natives face many unique
  health disparities and challenges and they confront many barriers when seeking care
  and treatment. These obstacles make it essential for healthcare professionals to
  engage the community in the development of culturally appropriate strategies with
  which to address health issues. This article describes a community-based participatory
  approach that was executed successfully by the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. By utilizing
  the Community Readiness Model, it effectively built on the culture and resiliency
  that exists in each of 10 communities to more successfully implement community-responsive
  health prevention and treatment. This article discusses the experience of the Choctaw
  Nation in its assessment and engagement of the community in addressing cardiovascular
  disease. Data are presented that reflect the successful use of the Community Readiness
  Model and discussion is provided. This article emphasizes the use of an effective
  community-based participatory method, Community Readiness, that enabled the Choctaw
  Nation to make strong 'inroads' into its respective service area through successful
  community engagement.
