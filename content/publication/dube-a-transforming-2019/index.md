abstract: "Aim: This paper describes how the transformation of youth mental health
  services in the rural Francophone region of the Acadian Peninsula in New Brunswick,
  Canada, is meeting the five objectives of ACCESS Open Minds. Method(s): Implementation
  of the ACCESS Open Minds framework of care in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick
  began in 2016 at a well-established volunteer centre and community-based mental
  health organization. Through focus groups with youth aged 14 to 22 (n = 13), community
  mapping was used to describe the youth-related mental health service transformation,
  followed by thematic analysis, validation by member checking and triangulation.
  Result(s): Preliminary results show a generally successful implementation of the
  ACCESS Open Minds model, as evidenced by the transformation of mental health service
  provision, the enhancement of capacity in human resources and the participation
  of youth. Transformation was evidenced across the five objectives of mental healthcare
  of ACCESS Open Minds, albeit to variable extents. Several facilitating factors and
  challenges are identified based on youths' accounts. Conclusion(s): It is possible
  to successfully implement the ACCESS Open Minds model among francophones living
  in a minority setting and despite the constraints of a rural area. Most key components
  of the framework were implemented with high program fidelity. The rural context
  presents unique challenges that require creative and effective use of resources,
  while offering opportunities that arise from a culture of resourcefulness and collaboration.Copyright
