abstract: Yolnu (Aboriginal Australians of northeast Arnhem Land) are interested in
  developing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems in their own
  languages to support communication opportunities and participation for their family
  members living with Machado-Joseph disease. Designing AAC systems in Aboriginal
  languages requires consideration of unique linguistic and cultural elements. Participatory
  action research in strength-based communication contexts was carried out by Yolnu
  and Balanda (the Yolnu word for non-Aboriginal people) researchers working together
  through a collaborative intercultural process. Culturally responsive literacy, language,
  and AAC activities were used to develop four prototype Yolnu AAC sytems for Yolnu
  with varied literacy skills. Data were coded using gerunds to identify and focus
  on action in the data. Reflective and analytical collaborative, oral group discussions
  were used to identify key considerations and, ultimately, a Yolnu metaphor for the
  research. Yolnu language, culture and worldview impacted all aspects of prototype
  design and decision making. Salient considerations related to representation, organization,
  layout, and access, are presented. Clinical implications and future research considerations
  are outlined.
