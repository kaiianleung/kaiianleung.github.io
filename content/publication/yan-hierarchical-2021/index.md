abstract: Deficits have been documented in visuo-orthographic processing as well as
  phonological retrieval/manipulation during visual word reading in individuals with
  reading disability (RD); however, the relationship between these deficits remains
  unclear. Previously, we found that during word reading, visuo-orthographic deficit
  appears to be a neural signature of RD, but deficits in phonological retrieval/manipulation
  appears to be a consequence of being RD (Cao et al., 2020). Therefore, in the current
  study, we directly tested the hypothesis that during visual word reading, deficit
  in phonological retrieval/manipulation may result from weakened input from visuo-orthographic
  regions, and that this relationship tends to be universal across languages. We conducted
  a dynamic causal modelling analysis of fMRI data from Chinese-English bilingual
  children (9-11 years, N = 78) with or without RD during a visual word rhyming judgment
  task. We found a weaker connection from the left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to
  the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) in children with RD and reading controls
  than the connection found in age controls for both Chinese and English. This finding
  suggests that the phonological deficit at the dIFG may result from weak input from
  the visuo-orthographic region and this connection appears to be responsive to reading
  level rather than RD, because the reading-control children were similar to children
  with RD. We also found that the left ITG was selectively connected with language-specific
  regions (i.e., the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) for Chinese and the left ventral
  inferior frontal gyrus (vIFG) for English) depending on the language being processed;
  however, this language selectivity was reduced in children with RD, suggesting that
  decreased language specialization is associated with RD. Using a double control
  design, our study suggests that during reading, the visuo-orthographic deficit of
  RD constrains the development of the connection from orthography to phonology and
  to other language-specific processing due to distorted quantity and quality of reading.
