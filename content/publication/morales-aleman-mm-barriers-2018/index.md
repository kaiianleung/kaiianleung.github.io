abstract: "Purpose: Alabama (AL) experienced a 145% increase in its Latino pop-ulation
  between 2000 and 2010; making it the state with the second fastest growing Latino
  population in the United States (US) during that time. Job opportunities in the
  agricultural, lumber and poultry industries drew (mostly Mexican and Central-American)
  immigrant families to AL. Since then, AL has become one of the states with the most
  severe anti-immigrant policies in the nation. Adolescent Latinas in the US and in
  AL are disproportionately affected by sexual health disparities compared to their
  non-Hispanic, white counterparts. However, to our knowledge, no other researchers
  have examined barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access for this sub-population.
  The purpose of this study is to examine barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare
  access among adolescent Latinas' through in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews
  (phase 1 of 3-phase study) to develop community driven, theory based, culturally-relevant,
  multilevel intervention strategies through a community-engaged process. Community
  based participatory research (CBPR) and the socioecological model of health provided
  the philosophical and theoretical frameworks, respectively. Method(s): From January
  to June of 2017, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with adolescents
  who: self-identified as Latina, were between 15 and 20 years, had been in the US
  for over five years, and lived in West AL. Participants were recruited through venue-based,
  purposeful-convenience sampling. Two bilingual (in English and Spanish) coders used
  an iterative process (between independent coding and consensus building) to analyze
  the data in NVivo 11. Result(s): Twenty young women participated in the study. Sixty-five
  percent self-identified as Mexican, 45% were between 15-16 years of age and 55%
  were between 17-19 years of age. Sixty-percent reported that they had health insurance
  and 35% reported that they had initiated sexual intercourse in their lifetime. With
  regard to sexual healthcare access, three main facilitators/barriers emerged: (1)
  parental approval/disapproval and embarrassment (\\\"pena\\\"); (2) structural facilitators/barriers
  to care (e.g., lack of transportation, flexible clinic hours); and (3) positive/negative
  experiences with providers (e.g., perceived discrimination based on immigrant status).
  When we asked what they would like in a sexual health promotion program, emergent
  themes included: (1) \\\"parents should be involved in programming\\\"; and (2)
  \\\"the program should be delivered by young Latinas who understand our experience\\\
  \". Conclusion(s): This work points to the importance of community driven, theory
  based, culturally-relevant approaches to address the healthcare access needs of
  under-served immigrant populations in emerging Latino/a communities in states like
  Alabama, where anti-immigrant sentiment and policies create real and perceived barriers
  to care. We will discuss our findings in light of the current sociopolitical context
  both in Alabama and nationally and position our findings within the extant literature
  which conceptualizes immigration (a global phenomenon) as a social determinant of
  health. Sources of Support: This research is funded by a supplement to promote diversity
  from the National Center for Advancing Transla-tional Sciences (3UL1TR001417-02S1)
  under the parent grant for the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Center for
  Clinical and Trans-lational Science (UL1TR001417)."
