abstract: "PURPOSE: Bilingual children are both over- and under-identified with developmental
  language disorder (DLD). We propose that this may be a function of monolingual approaches
  that fail to consider the dynamic nature of bilingualism as well as assumptions
  of bilingual delay. We explored the extent to which bilingual children with and
  without DLD demonstrated mixed dominance as a function of exposure to English. We
  document patterns of performance in bilingual children with and without DLD on the
  Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment or Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment-Middle
  Extension in Spanish, English, and their best language scores., METHOD: A total
  of 595 (100 with DLD) Spanish-English bilingual children between the ages of 5 and
  12 years were included in the analyses. We employed logistic regression to evaluate
  the probability of demonstrating mixed dominance across semantics and morphosyntax
  in Spanish and English by ability status. We then evaluated the association between
  English exposure and performance in Spanish, English, and the best language on semantics
  and morphosyntax measures., RESULTS: There were similar typically developing and
  DLD probabilities of Spanish or English dominance associated with high degrees of
  Spanish and English exposure. Mixed dominance was associated with both ability and
  exposure. Children with DLD demonstrated more mixed dominance from 0% to 60% English
  exposure. The patterns of mixed dominance were similar by ability when they had
  more than 60% exposure to English. There were significant associations between single
  language testing in Spanish and English with percentage of exposure for children
  with and without DLD. When the best score (comparing English and Spanish) was used,
  there were no significant associations with exposure for semantics or morphosyntax.,
  CONCLUSIONS: These results inform researchers and clinicians about the nature of
  bilingual proficiency in children with and without DLD. Mixed dominance was observed
  in both groups but with different patterns at lower levels of English exposure in
  children with and without DLD. We also see that when children's best score is considered,
  all differences in performance along the bilingual continuum are related to ability
  not language exposure. This has implications for how to consider children's language
  test scores in making clinical decisions about bilingual children. Presentation
