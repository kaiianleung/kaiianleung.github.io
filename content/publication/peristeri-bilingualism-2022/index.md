abstract: "LAY ABSTRACT: Previous research has suggested that bilingualism may improve
  cognition in children with autism, and that this boost may stem from improvement
  in executive functions. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children are considered
  to be reliable and valid measures of intelligence when administered to autistic
  children. These measures have so far revealed unusual psychometric properties in
  monolingual autistic children, notably distinctive patterns of strengths and weaknesses
  and low inter-correlation among verbal and nonverbal IQ subtests. The way bilingualism
  affects the intellectual functioning of autistic children has not been explored
  yet. Nor has there been a satisfactory factor structure that explains monolingual
  and bilingual autistic children's IQ performance in terms of individual factors,
  such as age and socioeconomic status. The current study examined the intelligence
  profiles of 316 bilingual and age- and gender-matched monolingual children with
  autism using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Third Edition. The study
  applied clustering models to extract intelligence subtypes of autism, and mediation
  analyses to examine potential mediation effects of age and socioeconomic status
  on the children's verbal and nonverbal IQ performance. The results support the mediational
  role of the children's socioeconomic status in the association between bilingualism
  and intelligence. Low-socioeconomic status bilingual autistic children outperformed
  their monolingual peers on both verbal and nonverbal subtests, while the differences
  faded in medium-socioeconomic status and high-socioeconomic status children. The
  findings emphasize the positive effects of bilingualism on low-socioeconomic status
  autistic children's intelligence and also highlight high-socioeconomic status as
  a factor that may mitigate discrepant patterns of strengths and weaknesses in monolingual
  children's IQ performance."
