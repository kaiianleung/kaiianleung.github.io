 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in vision impairment are prevalent as are low rates for recommended eye screenings, such as annual dilated eye exams for people with diabetes (40-65 %). A communityacademic partnership aimed to improve vision screening in a low-income, minority neighborhood by developing a multi-component vision health toolkit for social service providers to promote comprehensive vision exams among their consumers. METHOD(S): The team developed and tested a bilingual toolkit that included posters, brochures, table tents and magnifier cards. Thirty-seven local social service agencies (i.e., senior centers, food pantries), faith-based organizations and health centers were recruited to adopt the toolkit and have at least one staff member or volunteer serve as a Vision Health Champion for that site. We surveyed a subset of consumers at 15 intervention and 3 control sites before and 6 months after disseminating the toolkits to assess receipt of comprehensive eye exams, vision knowledge and comorbidities, and surveyed Vision Health Champions to assess implementation and provider knowledge at these same times. RESULT(S): The 156 consumers surveyed were largely female (68 %), Black (55 %) and had high diabetes (23 %) and hypertension (33 %) rates. At baseline, 72 % reported an eye exam in the past year and vision knowledge was fairly high (91 % correctly answered 3 or more out of 7 vision knowledge items). There was no baseline difference between intervention and control sites self-reported eye exam rates in the past year. Six month follow-up surveys were completed with 62 % of consumers. People at intervention sites were more likely to report a comprehensive eye exam in the past 6 months (45 % vs. 24 %, p=0.06). Those with diabetes at intervention sites were also more likely to have had an eye exam in the past 6 months than those with diabetes at control sites (66 % vs. 33 %, p\textless0.01). With respect to 44 of 61 Vision Health Champions surveyed at follow-up (72 % response rate), 80 % stated that the toolkit was easy to implement, 32 % integrated it into pre-existing programming and 90 % planned to continue using it. CONCLUSION(S): Even in a small pilot project, we demonstrated a significant increase in comprehensive eye examinations at intervention sites compared with control sites and among the targeted group - individuals with diabetes. We further demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a sustainable community-based intervention in a low-income setting at locations where people frequently congregate and interact with a range of social service providers. Novel, scalable approaches such as the use of Vision Health Champions in social service settings are a viable means of preventing and controlling diabetes complications, including vision loss.},
