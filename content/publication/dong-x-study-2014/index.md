abstract: Multiple barriers in research participation have excluded the Chinese older
  adults from benefitting the recent advancement of aging sciences. The paucity of
  systematic understanding of Chinese aging population necessitated the Population-Based
  Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE). Guided by community-based participatory
  research approach, the PINE study is a population-based epidemiological study of
  Chinese older adults aged 60 and above in the Greater Chicago area. We described
  study design and implantation of the PINE study, highlighting strategies in adapting
  a population-based study design to the Chinese community. These measures included
  community-engaged recruitment, innovative data collection methods, and culturally
  and linguistically sensitive study infrastructure. The intricate cultural and linguistic
  diversity among U.S. Chinese older adults, coupled with their demographic characteristics
  and residential pattern, present challenges and opportunities in implementing a
  population-based study of older adults. Implications for the research and practice
  in relation to future minority aging and social sciences studies are discussed.
