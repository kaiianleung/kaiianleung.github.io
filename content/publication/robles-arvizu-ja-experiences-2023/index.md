abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency
  virus (HIV) disproportionately affect young gay, bisexual and other men who have
  sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women of colour. We explored the experiences
  of community-based peer navigators ('Community Navigators') who participated in
  Impact Triad, a bilingual multilevel intervention developed by our community-based
  participatory research partnership to reduce STIs and HIV and address social determinants
  of health (e.g., employment, education, social support and discrimination) among
  young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. METHOD(S): Individual in-depth interviews
  were conducted with 15 Community Navigators who participated in Impact Triad. Themes
  were identified through constant comparison. RESULT(S): Community Navigators' mean
  age was 31.4 years. Seven were self-identified as African American/Black, 5 as Latine,
  2 as multiracial/multiethnic, 1 as Asian American, 10 as cisgender men, 4 as transgender
  women and 1 as gender nonbinary. Thirteen themes emerged in three domains: (1) key
  aspects of the Community Navigator role (e.g., desire to serve as a community resource,
  the importance of being part of the communities in which one was working, the value
  of having an official role, being connected to other Community Navigators to problem-solving
  and sustaining intervention aspects long-term); (2) experiences implementing Impact
  Triad (e.g., engaging community members, meeting prioritized needs, building trust,
  using social media, increasing awareness and knowledge and challenges related to
  COVID-19) and (3) lessons learned for future interventions (e.g., facilitating access
  to broader resources, building additional skills and increasing interactions among
  Community Navigators). CONCLUSION(S): Interviews identified important learnings
  about serving as Community Navigators and implementing Impact Triad that can guide
  future efforts to address STI/HIV disparities and social determinants of health
  through community-based peer navigation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Throughout
  this intervention trial, our partnership worked collaboratively with a study-specific
  community advisory board (CAB) comprised primarily of young GBMSM and transgender
  women of colour. Members of this CAB participated in all aspects of the trial including
  trial design, intervention development, recruitment and retention strategies, data
  collection and analysis, interpretation of findings and dissemination.Copyright
