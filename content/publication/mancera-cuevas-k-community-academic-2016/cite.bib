 abstract = {Background A community-university partnership was developedto address lupus disparities in the Hispanic/Latino Chicagolandcommunity. Lupus significantly impacts Latinos due to lack ofearly detection, diagnosis, and care. A curriculum was created toeducate Popular Opinion Leaders (POLs) as leaders who thenprovide lupus education to the community. POLs were trained inthree local communities; the POL groups consisted of 1) HighSchool Students, 2) Community Health Workers, and 3) ParentLeaders. Our goal was to pilot test this education program acrossdifferent age groups and literacy levels as a prelude to field workincreasing lupus awareness in the targeted communities.Materials and methods To measure knowledge acquisition ofthe newly trained POLs, pre-and post-test questionnaires wereadministered over four sessions. Questionnaires were designedwith a health literacy expert for content, clarity and literacy level.As part of the assessment, we also analysed the following demographic and acculturation variables: birthplace (Mexico/U.S./Other); # of years in the US; strong sense of belonging to an ethnic group (4-point scale) and the following lupus knowledge variables: lupus is a chronic disease (Yes/No/don't know); there is acure for lupus (Yes/No/don't know); and which symptom is not alupus symptom (choose from a list). Demographic and acculturation characteristics and knowledge responses pre-and post-testresponses were summarised by community using descriptivestatistics.Results We trained community health workers from Erie Neighbourhood House (n = 14), high school students from Cicero(n = 14) and parent leaders from Burbank (n = 28). Participantcharacteristics and knowledge gain are shown in Table 1.Conclusions Overall, there was evidence to support lupusknowledge improvement after the completion of POL educational sessions. We encountered some difficulties in performingthis evaluation due language difficulty not only limited to literacylevel but also in interpretation of questions and bilingual interpreters were needed to assist POL assessments. The next phase isto document the community contacts reached by POLs in thefield using Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping.},
