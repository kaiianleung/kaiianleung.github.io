 abstract = {Storytelling is a traditional practice for sharing and building Aboriginal knowledge systems and also a method that allows researchers to capture a community's perspective on health and wellness. This community-based research (CBR) uses storytelling to provide a perspective of HIV/AIDS to inform education, prevention and/or support strategies in the central Alberta region. There exists a significant disparity in HIV/AIDS rates among Aboriginals when compared to non-Aboriginals; this reality, along with the growing percentage of HIV reports and AIDS cases in Aboriginal communities, necessitates examination of the gaps, barriers, and needs related to this specific population. Stories collected indicate that there are significant barriers to culturally competent health services for Aboriginals. Lack of information and a common cross-generational language to discuss HIV/AIDS were significant barriers. Gender issues, stigmas and misinformation surrounding HIV/ AIDS were also prominent. Building on a process of cultural revitalization and continued decolonialization as well as programming to develop culturally competent health services are key strengths that can be used to address this health issue.},
