abstract: Storytelling is a traditional practice for sharing and building Aboriginal
  knowledge systems and also a method that allows researchers to capture a community's
  perspective on health and wellness. This community-based research (CBR) uses storytelling
  to provide a perspective of HIV/AIDS to inform education, prevention and/or support
  strategies in the central Alberta region. There exists a significant disparity in
  HIV/AIDS rates among Aboriginals when compared to non-Aboriginals; this reality,
  along with the growing percentage of HIV reports and AIDS cases in Aboriginal communities,
  necessitates examination of the gaps, barriers, and needs related to this specific
  population. Stories collected indicate that there are significant barriers to culturally
  competent health services for Aboriginals. Lack of information and a common cross-generational
  language to discuss HIV/AIDS were significant barriers. Gender issues, stigmas and
  misinformation surrounding HIV/ AIDS were also prominent. Building on a process
  of cultural revitalization and continued decolonialization as well as programming
  to develop culturally competent health services are key strengths that can be used
  to address this health issue.
