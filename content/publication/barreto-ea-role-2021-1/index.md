abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To identify areas where transition from hospital to community
  could be improved, with a special focus on racial, ethnic, and language differences.
  STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey administered by postal mail and bilingual
  telephone interviewers. METHOD(S): Patients were randomly selected within strata
  by race, ethnicity, and language proficiency. A total of 224 patients (response
  rate: 63.5%) who had recently experienced a hospital stay completed the survey.
  RESULT(S): Overall, 1 in 4 patients were alone at discharge. More than half of patients
  with limited English proficiency reported lack of access to medical interpreters
  and translated materials. We noted significant differences by race, ethnicity, and
  language in technology access and in patient-reported worries in the posthospital
  period. Hispanic or Latino patients and patients with limited English proficiency
  were less likely to report access to a computer and less likely to access the Patient
  Gateway portal. Black or African American patients were also less likely to use
  the Patient Gateway portal. Asian patients were more likely to be worried about
  getting home health services. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings highlight the enhanced
  difficulties that diverse patients may experience when transitioning from hospital
  to community-based settings. When considering how to best address the complex needs
  of diverse populations, interventions must be sensitive to the presence or absence
  of others, potential digital divides, and medical interpretation.Copyright Â© 2021
