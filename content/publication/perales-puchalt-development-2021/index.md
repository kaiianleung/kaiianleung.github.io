abstract: 'Objectives To describe the development of CuidaTEXT: a tailored text message
  intervention to support Latino dementia family caregivers.Methods CuidaTEXT is informed
  by the Stress Process Framework and Social Cognitive Theory. We developed and refined
  CuidaTEXT using a mixed-method approach that included thematic analysis and descriptive
  statistics. We followed six user-centered design stages, including the selection
  of design principles, software vendor collaboration, evidence-based foundation,
  caregiver and research/clinical advisory board guidance, sketching and prototyping,
  and usability testing among five Latino caregivers.Results CuidaTEXT is a bilingual
  6-month long intervention tailored to caregiver needs that includes: 1) 1-3 daily
  automatic messages (n=244) about logistics, dementia education, self-care, social
  support, end-of-life, care of the person with dementia, behavioral symptoms and
  problem-solving strategies; 2) 783 keyword-driven text messages for further help
  with the above topics; 3) live chat interaction with a coach for further help; 4)
  a 19-page reference booklet summarizing the purpose and functions of the intervention.
  CuidaTEXT’s prototype scored 97 out of 100 in the System Usability Scale.Conclusions
  CuidaTEXT’s prototype demonstrated high usability among Latino caregivers. CuidaTEXT’s
  feasibility is ready to be tested.Clinical Implications CuidaTEXT’s usability and
  its potential for widespread implementation holds promise in supporting Latino caregivers.Competing
