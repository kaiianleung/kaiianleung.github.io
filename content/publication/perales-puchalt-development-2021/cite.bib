 abstract = {Objectives To describe the development of CuidaTEXT: a tailored text message intervention to support Latino dementia family caregivers.Methods CuidaTEXT is informed by the Stress Process Framework and Social Cognitive Theory. We developed and refined CuidaTEXT using a mixed-method approach that included thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. We followed six user-centered design stages, including the selection of design principles, software vendor collaboration, evidence-based foundation, caregiver and research/clinical advisory board guidance, sketching and prototyping, and usability testing among five Latino caregivers.Results CuidaTEXT is a bilingual 6-month long intervention tailored to caregiver needs that includes: 1) 1-3 daily automatic messages (n=244) about logistics, dementia education, self-care, social support, end-of-life, care of the person with dementia, behavioral symptoms and problem-solving strategies; 2) 783 keyword-driven text messages for further help with the above topics; 3) live chat interaction with a coach for further help; 4) a 19-page reference booklet summarizing the purpose and functions of the intervention. CuidaTEXT’s prototype scored 97 out of 100 in the System Usability Scale.Conclusions CuidaTEXT’s prototype demonstrated high usability among Latino caregivers. CuidaTEXT’s feasibility is ready to be tested.Clinical Implications CuidaTEXT’s usability and its potential for widespread implementation holds promise in supporting Latino caregivers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the NIH under Grants R21 AG065755, K01 MD014177, and P30 AG072973.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Institutional Review Board of the University of Kansas Medical Center gave approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
