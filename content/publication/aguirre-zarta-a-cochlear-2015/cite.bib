 abstract = {Introduction: Acording to Furmansky H. (2003), To obtain optimal results the patient candidate for a cochlear implant CI must comply with features like: Professional: Availability of services, training and type of aproach. Family: Dynamic, participation and expectations. Child: Chronological Age However, it is common to find higher emphasis on the physiological, cognitive and family aspects decreasing weight in the sociocultural factor who affects rehabilitation. It is therefore important to emphasize on an integral profile from the rehabilitation aproach based on community (RBC). Objective(s): Recognize the importance of an integral profile of the patient with CI, from a Rehabilitation aproach Based on Community. Methods and Results: The 6 patients evaluated, those who belongs to an ethnic community do not get the expected benefits for lack of rehabilitation. The 6 patients have left the device for damage at the accesories, little auditory benefit for lack of programing, little use because of the conditions of sociocultural lif. Conclusion(s): The RBC, involves a process of intervention that can recognize the individual integrally, as a biosocial being, which rehabilitation process canbepotentiated from an individualized intervention work, involving their members, generating training in the community. Convert the house into the framework of the rehabilitation. The goal of the CI should expand and focus it not only surgery but in rehabilitation. The CI, from a RBC approach, allows ensure the benefits of the device and strenghten rehabilitation. The RBC, is a strategy that should be included in public policy from a differential approach.},
