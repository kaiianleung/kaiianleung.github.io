abstract: 'Background We sought to understand the barriers and facilitators to participation
  in research from the perspectives of South Asian people with asthma. Methods Eight
  focus groups were conducted in the preferred language of participants. Sampling
  was purposeful to ensure inclusion of males and females from differing ethnic, linguistic
  and religious backgrounds. Results The forming of trusting relationships was described
  as pivotal to the successful recruitment of minority ethnic groups into research;
  personalized approaches were likely to be better received than more impersonal written
  approaches. Notable barriers to participation included: the stigma of being labelled
  with asthma; concerns surrounding participation in pharmaceutical trials; major
  time or travel commitments and a failure to show respect by not making information
  available in minority ethnic languages. Flexibility, in terms of timing, location
  and respecting of cultural and religious sensitivities around gender segregation,
  together with the offer of incentives, were highlighted as key factors to promote
  participation. Conclusions The barriers to recruitment are largely surmountable,
  but these will necessitate the use of resource intensive and more personalized approaches
  than are commonly employed for the White European origin population. Our proposed
  model to enhance recruitment is likely to have transferability beyond the field
  of asthma. Â© The Author 2011, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of
