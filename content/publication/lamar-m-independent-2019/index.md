abstract: Sixty percent of Hispanics/Latinos are bilingual which research suggests
  may confer certain cognitive advantages. Female sex confers cognitive advantages
  in verbal learning and memory compared to male sex, regardless of race or ethnicity.
  Understanding the independent and interactive associations of bilingualism and sex
  with cognition may aid in predicting cognitive aging in Hispanics/Latinos. We examined
  baseline (2008-2011) data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos,
  a multicenter, prospective community-based study. Our analyses included 6,110 males
  and females textgreater=45 years old who self-reported birth and parents' origin
  outside of the continental US, Spanish as their first language, and were evaluated
  in Spanish. Bilingualism was assessed along a Likert scale (1 = only Spanish to
  4 = EnglishtextgreaterSpanish) for language proficiency (reading/spoken) and patterns
  of use (thinking/socializing). Cognitive testing included verbal learning, memory,
  fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS). Linear regression models adjusted
  for relevant confounders, the complex survey design, and sampling weights. Participants'
  self-reported language proficiency was Spanish better than English, while patterns
  of use suggested more Spanish than English. Higher language proficiency was associated
  with higher performance on all cognitive indices while higher patterns of use associated
  with higher fluency and DSS scores (p-values textless 0.01). Female sex was associated
  with higher performance on all cognitive indices (p-values textless 0.05). There
  were no significant interactions with bilingualism (regardless of metric) by sex
  on cognition. For Hispanics/Latinos residing in the continental US and reporting
  birth and parents' origin elsewhere, bilingualism and female sex have independent
  cognitive benefits that are important to consider when evaluating cognitive performance.
