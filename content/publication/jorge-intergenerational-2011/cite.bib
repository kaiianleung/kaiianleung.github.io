 abstract = {The article discusses the intergenerational aspects of a college level Spanish learning program embedded in a community of native language speakers which was implemented at Pfizer College. A discussion of the aims and objectives of the program, which was created to act as a catalyst in the realignment of interpersonal relationships among multiple generations of its participants, is presented. The benefits that the program provides to all of its participants, including college faculty, students and participating extended families, are examined.},
