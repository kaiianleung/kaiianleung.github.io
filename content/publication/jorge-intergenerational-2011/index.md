abstract: The article discusses the intergenerational aspects of a college level Spanish
  learning program embedded in a community of native language speakers which was implemented
  at Pfizer College. A discussion of the aims and objectives of the program, which
  was created to act as a catalyst in the realignment of interpersonal relationships
  among multiple generations of its participants, is presented. The benefits that
  the program provides to all of its participants, including college faculty, students
  and participating extended families, are examined.
