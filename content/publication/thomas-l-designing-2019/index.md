abstract: "Context: The Canterbury region in Sydney is highly culturally and linguistically
  diverse, with 45% of residents speaking a non-English language at home. Services
  within this region have identified that non-English speaking mothers are less engaged
  with parenting programs. The first 2000 days of a child's life are critical for
  future health. As such, engaging non-English speaking migrant families with parenting
  groups is an important equity issue. Objective(s): We sought to re-design the recruitment
  processes, structure and content of parenting groups delivered within Sydney Local
  Health District for two target groups-Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. This
  project is funded by Healthdirect Australia. Design(s): The intervention was developed
  in collaboration with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service from Sydney Local
  Health District and with Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking community members. Setting(s):
  The new parenting groups will be delivered in Campsie and Lakemba Early Childhood
  Health Centres (within Sydney Local Health District). Participant(s): Bangla and
  Mandarin speaking new mothers and grandmothers with a 0-6 month old baby will be
  invited to attend the new parenting groups. Finding(s): Working with the Child and
  Family Health Nursing Service and members of the target community enabled a cultural
  re-design of current parenting program recruitment processes, structure, delivery
  and content for Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. Implication(s) for practice:
  Working in partnership with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service and the
  community increases the sustainability of this intervention. If the parenting groups
  and recruitment processes are successful, they have the potential to be delivered
  on an ongoing basis."
