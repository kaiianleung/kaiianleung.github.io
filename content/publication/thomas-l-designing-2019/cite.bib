 abstract = {Context: The Canterbury region in Sydney is highly culturally and linguistically diverse, with 45% of residents speaking a non-English language at home. Services within this region have identified that non-English speaking mothers are less engaged with parenting programs. The first 2000 days of a child's life are critical for future health. As such, engaging non-English speaking migrant families with parenting groups is an important equity issue. Objective(s): We sought to re-design the recruitment processes, structure and content of parenting groups delivered within Sydney Local Health District for two target groups-Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. This project is funded by Healthdirect Australia. Design(s): The intervention was developed in collaboration with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service from Sydney Local Health District and with Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking community members. Setting(s): The new parenting groups will be delivered in Campsie and Lakemba Early Childhood Health Centres (within Sydney Local Health District). Participant(s): Bangla and Mandarin speaking new mothers and grandmothers with a 0-6 month old baby will be invited to attend the new parenting groups. Finding(s): Working with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service and members of the target community enabled a cultural re-design of current parenting program recruitment processes, structure, delivery and content for Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. Implication(s) for practice: Working in partnership with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service and the community increases the sustainability of this intervention. If the parenting groups and recruitment processes are successful, they have the potential to be delivered on an ongoing basis.},
