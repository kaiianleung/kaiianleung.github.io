abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the growth of previously
  established clinical markers of developmental language disorder (DLD) in Spanish-speaking
  bilingual children with and without DLD., METHOD: Forty-three bilingual children
  with DLD and 57 typically developing children were tested 3 times over a 2-year
  period. Their average age at Time 1 was 5;10 (years;months). All children completed
  an elicitation task examining the production of articles, clitics, verbs, and the
  subjunctive mood in Spanish at each time point, in addition to other behavioral
  testing in Spanish and English. We used growth curve analysis to examine change
  patterns of the morphosyntactic structures over time., RESULTS: At the onset of
  the study, children without DLD produced higher accuracy rates than children with
  DLD across all morphosyntactic structures. In addition, there was a positive effect
  of time on all structures. Furthermore, the interaction between time and DLD was
  statistically significant for clitic pronouns., CONCLUSION: In agreement with previous
  literature on language growth in monolingual children with DLD, bilingual children
  with DLD showed language growth that was parallel to that of bilingual children
  without DLD but with significantly lower levels of attainment. Supplemental Material
