 abstract = {VFRs are at a greater risk of contracting travel-related illnesses such as malaria, and their knowledge about travel health tends to be poor. Since 2009, community-based activities targeting potential and impending VFRs were performed by a multidisciplinary team in Madrid, Spain. The design and distribution of multilingual and culturally-sensitive material following a qualitative research, and intercultural mediators were key tools of the health education programme.
