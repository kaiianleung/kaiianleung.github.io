abstract: Many behavioral health materials have not been translated into Spanish.
  Of those that are available in Spanish, some of them have not been translated correctly,
  many are only appropriate for a subgroup of Latinos, and/or multiple versions of
  the same materials exist. This article describes an innovative model of conducting
  bilingual English-Spanish translations as part of community-based participatory
  research studies and provides recommendations based on this model. In this article,
  the traditional process of conducting bilingual translations is reviewed, and an
  innovative model for conducting translations in collaboration with community partners
  is described. Finally, recommendations for conducting future health research studies
  with community partners are provided. Researchers, health care providers, educators,
  and community partners will benefit from learning about this innovative model that
  helps produce materials that are more culturally appropriate than those that are
  produced with the most commonly used method of conducting translations.
