abstract: 'Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Australia experience
  both significant health disparities and a lack of access to services. Consequently,
  there have been calls for culturally appropriate services for people with chronic
  disease in CALD populations. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature
  on the effectiveness of culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent
  chronic disease in CALD communities. Evidence was sought from randomized controlled
  trials and controlled studies that examined strategies for promoting cultural competence
  in health service delivery to CALD communities. The outcomes examined included changes
  in consumer health behaviours, utilisation/satisfaction with the service, and the
  cultural competence of health-care providers. Of the 202 studies that were identified
  only 24 met the inclusion criteria. The five categories of intervention that were
  identified included: (1) the use of community-based bi-lingual health workers; (2)
  providing cultural competency training for health workers; (3) using interpreter
  service for CALD people; (4) using multimedia and culturally sensitive videos to
  promote health for CALD people and (5) establishing community point-of-care services
  for CALD people with chronic disease. The review supported the use of trained bi-lingual
  health workers, who are culturally competent, as a major consideration in the development
  of an appropriate health service model for CALD communities. Â© 2011 Blackwell Publishing
