abstract: 'Background: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) predicts incident heart failure
  (HF) independent of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. In MESA, Components
  of CAC, volume and density, have opposite associations with incident CVD, such that
  for a given volume of CAC, higher CAC density is inversely associated with events.
  The relationship between CAC volume and density with HF is unknown. Method(s): We
  studied 6814 participants in a multi-ethnic, community-based cohort, free from clinical
  CVD at recruitment. CAC volume and density were measured by non-contrast CARDIAC
  CT at the baseline exam (2000-2002). Adjudicated HF events were assessed through
  2014, and analysis limited to those with imaging confirmation and estimated ejection
  fraction (EF). Cox proportional hazard was used to estimate independent associations
  of baseline CAC volume and density with incident HF: HF with reduced (textless 50%),
  and preserved EF (HFrEF & HFpEF respectively). Result(s): The mean age was 62+10
  years, 47% were men, 38% identified as European-, 28% as African-, 22% as Hispanic-,
  and 12% as Chinese-ethnicity. Average time to 189 HF events (119 HFrEF & 70 HFpEF)
  was 6.6 years. In unadjusted models, higher CAC volume (HR 1.27 [1.02-1.59], p=0.03),
  but not CAC density (HR 0.87 [0.67-1.13], p=0.29) was significantly associated with
  incident HF, non-significant associations were observed with HFrEF, or HFpEF, and
  no significant associations were observed for all three outcomes after adjustments
  for demographics and CVD risk factors (Table). Also, in unadjusted analyses, stratified
  by sex (p-value for interaction = 0.13), higher CAC volume was associated with increased
  risk for HF (HR 1.37 [1.03-1.81], p=0.03) and HFpEF (HR 1.76 [0.99-3.16], p=0.06),
  in males only. No significant associations were observed after adjustments. Conclusion(s):
  In a multi-ethnic cohort, CAC volume and density were not independently associated
  with HF, the trend for volume was positive while density was inverse. Low frequency
  of incident HF in our cohort was an important limitation.'
