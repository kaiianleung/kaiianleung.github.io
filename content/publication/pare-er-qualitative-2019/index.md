abstract: Disparities in minority health are strongly associated with reduced access
  to culturally familiar food and physical activity opportunities. This qualitative
  study explores a Midwest, urban Hispanic/Latino community, the members' experiences
  with their multidimensional environment and its influence on their nutrition and
  physical activity choices. Using the principles of community-based participatory
  research in collaboration with a trusted, local Hispanic/Latino community agency,
  we conducted five bilingual focus groups with a total of 46 self-selected participants
  (44 women and 2 men). We find that one's perception of the environmental factors
  of access, convenience, affordability, and safety influence food and physical activity
  decision making. Findings can be used to inform interventions to enhance culturally
  appropriate outreach, increase food equity, and decrease health disparities.
