abstract: 'Background: Compared with the general population in the United States (U.S.),
  Hispanics with hypertension are less likely to be aware of their condition, to take
  antihypertensive medication, and to adopt healthy lifestyles to control high blood
  pressure. We examined whether a multi-community intervention successfully increased
  the prevalence of actions to control hypertension among Hispanics.Methods: Annual
  survey from 2009-2012 was conducted in six Hispanic communities in the Racial and
  Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Across the U.S.Project: The survey
  used address based sampling design that matched the geographies of intervention
  program.Results: Age- and sex-standardized prevalences of taking hypertensive medication,
  changing eating habits, cutting down on salt, and reducing alcohol use significantly
  increased among Hispanics with self-reported hypertension in REACH communities.
  The 3-year relative percent increases were 5.8, 6.8, 7.9, and 35.2% for the four
  indicators, respectively. These favorable (healthier) trends occurred in both foreign-born
  and U.S.-born Hispanics.Conclusion: This large community-based participatory intervention
  resulted in more Hispanic residents in the communities taking actions to control
  high blood pressure.'
