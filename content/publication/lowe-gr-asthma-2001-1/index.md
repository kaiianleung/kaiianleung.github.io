abstract: "The Asthma Linking Project was a joint project of the Royal Children's
  Hospital and North Richmond Community Health Centre, in Melbourne. The primary aim
  of this longitudinal project was to evaluate the effectiveness of community based
  asthma education and support provided to culturally and linguistically diverse families
  and those with other complex health and social needs. The project, which took place
  between 1996 and 2000, evaluated a range of health and quality of life outcomes
  for 50 children and their families, using a triangulated approach incorporating
  quantitative and qualitative research methods. This paper presents five qualitative
  themes which were identified as important contributors to optimal asthma education
  and support with this inner city population: time and timing; language and cultural
  appropriateness; tailoring education and support to needs; collaboration and coordination
  of care; and educator-participant relationship. These themes are likely to be relevant
  to other health promotion and community development projects with similar populations."
