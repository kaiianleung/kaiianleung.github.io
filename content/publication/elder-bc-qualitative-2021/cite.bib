 abstract = {In this methodology article, the authors illustrate how they conducted multilingual qualitative research in an exploration of the barriers that Deaf people in Northern Ireland face when attempting to access the system of justice. The authors' research practices are informed, to the extent possible, by the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). They explore the challenges of conducting research in American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Irish Sign Language (ISL), and spoken English, facilitated by sign language interpreters fluent in BSL and ISL. Centering the research on the lived experiences of Deaf people who navigate the system of justice, the authors implemented CBPR-informed research methods, which ultimately led to sustained discussion and joint action by the authors and members of the Northern Ireland Deaf community aimed at the removal of barriers that Deaf people face when interacting with the justice system. By writing about their methodological approach in Northern Ireland, the authors wish to be transparent about their work in the hope that other researchers can replicate their successes and avoid the limitations of conducting this work in partnership with members of the Deaf community in other countries.Copyright © 2021},
