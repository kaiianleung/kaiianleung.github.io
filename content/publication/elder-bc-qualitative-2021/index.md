abstract: In this methodology article, the authors illustrate how they conducted multilingual
  qualitative research in an exploration of the barriers that Deaf people in Northern
  Ireland face when attempting to access the system of justice. The authors' research
  practices are informed, to the extent possible, by the principles of community-based
  participatory research (CBPR). They explore the challenges of conducting research
  in American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Irish Sign Language
  (ISL), and spoken English, facilitated by sign language interpreters fluent in BSL
  and ISL. Centering the research on the lived experiences of Deaf people who navigate
  the system of justice, the authors implemented CBPR-informed research methods, which
  ultimately led to sustained discussion and joint action by the authors and members
  of the Northern Ireland Deaf community aimed at the removal of barriers that Deaf
  people face when interacting with the justice system. By writing about their methodological
  approach in Northern Ireland, the authors wish to be transparent about their work
  in the hope that other researchers can replicate their successes and avoid the limitations
  of conducting this work in partnership with members of the Deaf community in other
  countries.Copyright Â© 2021
