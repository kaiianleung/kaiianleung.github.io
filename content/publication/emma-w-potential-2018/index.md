abstract: 'Background: End of life care takes place in a variety of non-cancer settings
  but how to ensure access for all patients who could benefit is less well understood
  than for people dying with cancer. There are inequalities in outcomes and access
  to care for people of South Asian ethnicity living with kidney disease in the UK
  and reducing these are priorities for policy makers, patients and practitioners.
  Action research methodology brings together investigation and practice for service
  improvement. Method(s): Using action research and working with renal clinicians
  at four NHS sites in the UK, primary data about access and experience of end of
  life care was collected through focus groups with 45 care providers and individual
  interviews with 16 South Asian patients with ESKF. 7 bilingual interviewers who
  conducted patient interviews also took part in a focus group providing feedback
  on the research process. Researcher reflection and analysis from the 3 qualitative
  data sources were synthesised thematically to produce a theory building model from
  this project. Result(s): Thirteen iterative themes described the overarching learning
  from the research process. The model was in a spiral form with each theme a step
  in the theory building process. Two dimensions: putting evidence into practice;
  and ethical care underpinned good practice in end of life kidney care. This analysis
  of the action research process suggested greater integration of research with practice
  in communicating about end of life care with patients and their families early on
  in the end of life phase could be a means to reduce inequalities in access. This
  has implications for the training of kidney care providers to conduct therapeutic
  exploratory interviews and for kidney care teams to include bilingual support for
  patients, both requiring cultural change in practice. Conclusion(s): Exploratory
  action research is a useful vehicle for building a theoretical base with which to
  understand and improve access and cultural competency in context. In complex and
  sensitive healthcare scenarios such as end of life kidney care, action research
  could facilitate closer integration of research and practice and become a culturally
  competent element of care.'
