abstract: The prevalence of autism worldwide has risen steadily in the last two decades,
  while bilingualism is also becoming increasingly prevalent in today's rapidly globalizing
  world. The current study aimed to investigate bilingualism effects in the pronoun
  resolution skills of children with autism in comparison to age-matched monolingual
  children with autism, as well as monolingual and bilingual children of typical development
  (Nu = 20 participants per group). Results showed that autistic children had general
  difficulty anchoring ambiguous pronouns to entities that were linguistically expressed
  in discourse, yet, the bilingual children with autism were more sensitive to the
  topicality of the entities in syntactic subject position and more prone to identify
  them as suitable referents of ambiguous null pronouns as compared to their monolingual
  peers. The findings suggest that bilingualism is not detrimental to autistic children's
  pronoun resolution skills. The current study aimed at determining how bilingualism
  influences ambiguous pronoun comprehension in children with autism as compared to
  bilingual and monolingual children of typical development. The findings show that
  bilingualism was not detrimental to the autistic children's pronoun resolution skills,
  further suggesting that having acquired more than one language does not exacerbate
  autistic children's deficits in the comprehension of pronouns. Copyright Â© 2021
