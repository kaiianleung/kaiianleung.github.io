 abstract = {Latino cancer survivors have lower survival rates for most cancers relative to non-Latino whites, including, colorectal, prostate, and breast. In addition, Latinos experience health disparities in both access to care and quality of care. Experts recommend providing psychosocial services as an integral part of quality cancer care; however, there continues to be a paucity of information on the efficacy of Patient Navigators (PNs) in linking Latino cancer survivors to appropriate psychosocial services. Redes En Accion: The National Latino Cancer Research Network partnered with LIVESTRONG Cancer Navigation Services Patient Navigation program (PN-LCNS) to provide an intervention to improve wellness and increase access to psychosocial services among non-metastatic Latino cancer survivors from Texas and Chicago using trained bilingual, bicultural PNs. The study design involved a mixed-methods approach in two phases. Phase I used a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach wherein PNs engaged community partners who provide services to breast, colorectal and prostate Latino cancer survivors. Phase II was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the efficacy of combining PN-facilitated interventions with the culturally tailored and CBPR-informed PN-LCNS in 300 breast, prostate and colorectal Latino cancer survivors. Outcomes investigated were improvements in: 1) quality of life (QOL), both general and disease-specific, and; 2) treatment follow-up compliance. While limited work has addressed the psychosocial needs of Latino cancer survivors, culturally-competent interventions using PNs have potential to address these needs and significantly improve Latino cancer survivorship.Copyright © 2018},
