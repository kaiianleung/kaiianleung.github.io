abstract: 'Latino cancer survivors have lower survival rates for most cancers relative
  to non-Latino whites, including, colorectal, prostate, and breast. In addition,
  Latinos experience health disparities in both access to care and quality of care.
  Experts recommend providing psychosocial services as an integral part of quality
  cancer care; however, there continues to be a paucity of information on the efficacy
  of Patient Navigators (PNs) in linking Latino cancer survivors to appropriate psychosocial
  services. Redes En Accion: The National Latino Cancer Research Network partnered
  with LIVESTRONG Cancer Navigation Services Patient Navigation program (PN-LCNS)
  to provide an intervention to improve wellness and increase access to psychosocial
  services among non-metastatic Latino cancer survivors from Texas and Chicago using
  trained bilingual, bicultural PNs. The study design involved a mixed-methods approach
  in two phases. Phase I used a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach
  wherein PNs engaged community partners who provide services to breast, colorectal
  and prostate Latino cancer survivors. Phase II was a randomized controlled trial
  (RCT) that evaluated the efficacy of combining PN-facilitated interventions with
  the culturally tailored and CBPR-informed PN-LCNS in 300 breast, prostate and colorectal
  Latino cancer survivors. Outcomes investigated were improvements in: 1) quality
  of life (QOL), both general and disease-specific, and; 2) treatment follow-up compliance.
  While limited work has addressed the psychosocial needs of Latino cancer survivors,
  culturally-competent interventions using PNs have potential to address these needs
  and significantly improve Latino cancer survivorship.Copyright Â© 2018'
