abstract: Although bilingual speakers are very good at selectively using one language
  rather than another, sometimes language selection errors occur. To investigate how
  bilinguals monitor their speech errors and control their languages in use, we recorded
  event-related potentials (ERPs) in unbalanced Dutch-English bilingual speakers in
  a cued language-switching task. We tested the conflict-based monitoring model by
  investigating the error-related negativity (ERN) and comparing the effects of the
  two switching directions (i.e., to the first language, L1 vs. to the second language,
  L2). Results show that the speakers made more language selection errors when switching
  from their L2 to the L1 than vice versa. In the EEG, we observed a robust ERN effect
  following language selection errors compared to correct responses, reflecting monitoring
  of speech errors. Most interestingly, the ERN effect was enlarged when the speakers
  were switching to their L2 (less conflict) compared to switching to the L1 (more
  conflict). Our findings do not support the conflict-based monitoring model. We discuss
  an alternative account in terms of error prediction and reinforcement learning.
