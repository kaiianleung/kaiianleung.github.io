abstract: 'Background: Latinx populations have experienced disproportionately high
  case rates of COVID-19 across the USA. Latinx communities in non-traditional migration
  areas may experience greater baseline day-to-day challenges such as a lack of resources
  for immigrants and insufficient language services. These challenges may be exacerbated
  by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This article describes the results of an initial
  community health needs assessment to better understand the prevention and care of
  COVID-19 infection in the Cincinnati Latinx community. Methods: We used convergent
  mixed methods to examine barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 prevention and care
  for those with infection. Results: Latinx adults â‰¥ 18 years old completed 255 quantitative
  surveys and 17 qualitative interviews. Overarching mixed methods domains included
  knowledge, prevention, work, challenges, and treatment. Quantitative results largely
  reinforced qualitative results (confirmation). Certain quantitative and qualitative
  results, however, diverged and expanded insights related to caring for COVID-19
  infection among Latinx adults (expansion). There were infrequent contradictions
  between quantitative and qualitative findings (discordance). Primary barriers for
  the Latinx community during the COVID-19 pandemic included insecurities in food,
  jobs, housing, and immigration. Key facilitators included having trusted messengers
  of health-related information. Conclusion: Public health interventions should be
  centered on community partnerships and the use of trusted messengers. Wraparound
  services (including resources for immigrants) are essential public health services.
  Close partnership with employers is essential as lack of sick leave and mask supplies
  were more frequent barriers than knowledge. These findings emerged from experiences
  during the COVID-19 pandemic but likely generalize to future public health crises.'
