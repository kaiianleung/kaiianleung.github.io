abstract: In the U.S., approximately half of maids and housekeeping cleaners are Latino
  or Hispanic, while the vast majority are women (88.3%). This largely immigrant,
  underserved workforce faces complex factors, which may contribute to adverse health
  outcomes. To understand relevant barriers and challenges, this mixed-methods study
  explored the environmental health needs of a heterogeneous group of Latinas in New
  Jersey (NJ) who clean occupationally, and consisted of 3 focus groups (N = 15) with
  a cross-sectional survey (N = 9), both conducted in Spanish. Participants were recruited
  from community-based English as a Second Language classes in Hackensack, NJ. Analysis
  of focus group audio recordings included descriptive and in vivo coding followed
  by inductive coding to explore thematic analysis. The survey responses were evaluated
  using descriptive statistics. As per the survey results, the environmental health
  needs of this population include sore muscles, back problems, asthma, other respiratory
  issues, migraine or headache, and skin issues (rash, etc.). In the group discussions,
  the roles of genetics, food, and chemical exposures in cancer etiology were of great
  interest and a variety of opinions on the topic were explored. Both the focus group
  discussions and survey responses suggested that this population also faces barriers
  including lack of training, chemical exposures and inadequate personal protective
  equipment (PPE). These barriers are compounded by daily environmental exposures
  from personal home cleaning practices. The development of culturally- and linguistically-appropriate
  interventions are warranted to better protect the health of essential occupational
  cleaners who keep homes, businesses and schools clean. Copyright Â© The Author(s)
