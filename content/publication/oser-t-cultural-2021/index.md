abstract: Diabetes impacts rural populations at higher rates compared to their urban
  counterparts. Diabetes selfmanagement education and support (DSMES) is an evidence-based
  standard of care for people with diabetes. Yet, in rural areas, DSMES is often not
  available, culturally relevant, or integrated into primary care practices where
  many people receive diabetes care. This study uses a community-based participatory
  research (CBPR) approach to adapt the language, tools, and delivery of a DSMES program
  for use in Spanish and Englishspeaking populations in the High Plains Research Network
  in rural eastern Colorado. Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a CBPR method that combines
  medical, research, and local community member expertise to create locally relevant
  language, messages and materials to promote discussion and action around a medical
  condition. For this study, community partners included 13 diverse community members
  (including bilingual Spanish-speakers, patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers).
  The group identified a particular need to increase awareness of the connection between
  diabetes and mental health, specifically depression, and diabetes burnout. Language
  and tools to address stigma and normalize the connection, talking points to initiate
  discussions with care teams, and calls for practices to increase screening for depression
  among patients with diabetes, are under development. Additional themes identified
  include incorporating nutrition information for food that is culturally appropriate
  and locally available, and integrating DSMES within the primary care practices where
  people with diabetes receive their care. Community engagement is crucial to support
  DSMES program adoption in rural communities.
