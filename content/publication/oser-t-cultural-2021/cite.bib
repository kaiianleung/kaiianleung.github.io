 abstract = {Diabetes impacts rural populations at higher rates compared to their urban counterparts. Diabetes selfmanagement education and support (DSMES) is an evidence-based standard of care for people with diabetes. Yet, in rural areas, DSMES is often not available, culturally relevant, or integrated into primary care practices where many people receive diabetes care. This study uses a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to adapt the language, tools, and delivery of a DSMES program for use in Spanish and Englishspeaking populations in the High Plains Research Network in rural eastern Colorado. Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a CBPR method that combines medical, research, and local community member expertise to create locally relevant language, messages and materials to promote discussion and action around a medical condition. For this study, community partners included 13 diverse community members (including bilingual Spanish-speakers, patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers). The group identified a particular need to increase awareness of the connection between diabetes and mental health, specifically depression, and diabetes burnout. Language and tools to address stigma and normalize the connection, talking points to initiate discussions with care teams, and calls for practices to increase screening for depression among patients with diabetes, are under development. Additional themes identified include incorporating nutrition information for food that is culturally appropriate and locally available, and integrating DSMES within the primary care practices where people with diabetes receive their care. Community engagement is crucial to support DSMES program adoption in rural communities.},
