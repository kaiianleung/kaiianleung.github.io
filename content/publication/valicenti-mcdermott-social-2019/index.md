abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Bilingualism is increasingly prevalent; however, research in
  bilingual children with autism is sparse. The purpose of this study was to compare
  social skills and autistic features in monolingual English and bilingual English-Spanish
  children with autism spectrum disorder., METHODS: We conducted a review of the multidisciplinary
  evaluations done in all children aged one to six years diagnosed with autism spectrum
  disorder in an inner city, university-affiliated clinic from 2003 to 2013. Collected
  information included demographics, developmental testing, and autistic characteristics.,
  RESULTS: We identified 462 children; 165 were bilingual English-Spanish and 297
  were monolingual English. Parents of bilingual children reported stereotyped or
  repetitive use of language more often (66% vs 48% P = 0.002) than monolinguals.
  Significant differences were not found in social interaction, use of nonverbal behaviors,
  peer relationships, sharing or social or emotional reciprocity, mannerisms, or autism
  severity., CONCLUSIONS: Bilingualism does not seem to confer an extra vulnerability
  on children with autism spectrum disorder; however, differences in qualitative use
  of language were observed. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'
