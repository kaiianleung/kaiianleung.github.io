abstract: The current paper describes a study that sought to determine the beliefs,
  practices, and needs of parents living in Montreal, Quebec, who were raising their
  children bi/multilingually. The parents (N = 27) participated in a total of nine
  focus group and individual interviews in which they discussed their family language
  policies (language ideologies, practices, and actions taken to maintain a language).
  Through rounds of deductive and inductive coding and analysis, family language policies
  regarding English and/or French were compared with policies regarding heritage languages.
  The participants’ family language policies were further examined in light of Quebec’s
  official language policy of interculturalism. Findings indicate a complex co-existence
  of family and official language policy in which parents both support Quebec’s official
  language policy by converging towards French as a common public language and questioning
  the policy’s stance on official institutional support for heritage languages.
