 abstract = {Purpose of Study: Cancer is the 2nd highest cause of mortality in Latinos after heart disease. Both of these illnesses have genetic as well as environmental components. Although overall rates of incidence and mortality are lower in Latinos than Whites, Latinos are diagnosed at more advanced stages of common cancers. The goals of this project were threefold a) educate Latinos on the value of knowing one's family health history b) connect Latinos with community resources for cancer screening, c) ultimately increase provider-patient communication around family health history and early detection in the clinical setting. Methods Used: A literature review was conducted to determine best practices for delivery of this project; published literature suggested collaboration with community organizations, along with bilingual presentations for Latinos of all educational backgrounds. Clinical staff and providers were consulted. Educational posters were made; collaboration with community partners yielded helpful brochures. Using self-reported family health history, community members were informed of sponsored cancer screening services and a sliding scale clinic at a community center health fair for almost 200 community members in Southwest Seattle. Motivational interviewing in Spanish and English was employed to empower community members to make lifestyle changes and to seek resources early to reduce cancer risk factors. Summary of Results: This presentation served as a pilot for bridging the gap between environmental and genetic disease risk. All community members remarked that they had not seen a focus on family health history and wanted to learn more about how to communicate disease risk with their provider. Staff & community members stressed the importance of continuing to have providers address family health history in a culturally sensitive but helpful way. Conclusion(s): Awareness of family health history has a role in preventive health, particularly in early detection for at risk families. Family health history may be more reliably acquired if patients feel that their family history if important in their own health. Community stakeholders, in partnership with providers, can mediate awareness of family health and promote healthy lifestyles, including regular cancer screening and access to primary care.},
