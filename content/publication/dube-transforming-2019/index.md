abstract: "AIM: This paper describes how the transformation of youth mental health
  services in the rural Francophone region of the Acadian Peninsula in New Brunswick,
  Canada, is meeting the five objectives of ACCESS Open Minds., METHODS: Implementation
  of the ACCESS Open Minds framework of care in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick
  began in 2016 at a well-established volunteer centre and community-based mental
  health organization. Through focus groups with youth aged 14 to 22 (n = 13), community
  mapping was used to describe the youth-related mental health service transformation,
  followed by thematic analysis, validation by member checking and triangulation.,
  RESULTS: Preliminary results show a generally successful implementation of the ACCESS
  Open Minds model, as evidenced by the transformation of mental health service provision,
  the enhancement of capacity in human resources and the participation of youth. Transformation
  was evidenced across the five objectives of mental healthcare of ACCESS Open Minds,
  albeit to variable extents. Several facilitating factors and challenges are identified
  based on youths' accounts., CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to successfully implement
  the ACCESS Open Minds model among francophones living in a minority setting and
  despite the constraints of a rural area. Most key components of the framework were
  implemented with high program fidelity. The rural context presents unique challenges
  that require creative and effective use of resources, while offering opportunities
  that arise from a culture of resourcefulness and collaboration. Copyright Â© 2019
