abstract: 'In this study, the authors compare the production of internal codas and
  branching onsets in four groups of children learning French: monolingual typically-developing
  children (n = 12), bilingual typically-developing children (n = 61), monolingual
  children with Specific Language Impairment (n = 17) and bilingual children with
  Specific Language Impairment (n = 20). Their elicited productions were collected
  using a nonword repetition task (LITMUS-NWR-French), containing 71 nonwords with
  different syllable types. Except for typically-developing monolingual children,
  all children performed significantly better on branching onsets than on internal
  codas. Moreover, the repair strategies used in erroneous productions also indicate
  that children had more difficulties with internal codas: all the cases of metathesis
  affecting a target internal coda resulted in the production of a branching onset
  whereas the contrary was not observed. The differences in the rates of target-like
  production and the patterns of metathesis of these two structures suggest that internal
  codas are more difficult than branching onsets for children learning French. (PsycInfo
