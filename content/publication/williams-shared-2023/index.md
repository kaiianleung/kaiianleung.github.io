abstract: Language control is an essential cognitive process that allows bilinguals
  to fluently produce language by reducing cross-language interference. Yet, it remains
  unclear whether the control processes implemented when reducing cross-language interference
  are similar to those when reducing within-language interference. Since prior research
  has shown contradictory results, we set out to investigate this issue further based
  on a combination of language switch costs, as a measure of control processes resolving
  cross-language interference, and Stroop incongruency, as a measure of control processes
  resolving within-language interference. Relying on a range of statistical techniques,
  the results across three experiments testing three different groups of bilinguals
  (i.e., Dutch-English, Arabic-English, and Chinese-English) showed no clear interaction
  between language switch costs and Stroop incongruency, and neither was this pattern
  influenced by language dominance. These results are more in line with the claim
  that different controlprocesses are implemented to reduce cross- and within-language
  interference.
