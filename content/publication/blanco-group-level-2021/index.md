abstract: "Significance: Early monolingual versus bilingual experience induces adaptations
  in the development of linguistic and cognitive processes, and it modulates functional
  activation patterns during the first months of life. Resting-state functional connectivity
  (RSFC) is a convenient approach to study the functional organization of the infant
  brain. RSFC can be measured in infants during natural sleep, and it allows to simultaneously
  investigate various functional systems. Adaptations have been observed in RSFC due
  to a lifelong bilingual experience. Investigating whether bilingualism-induced adaptations
  in RSFC begin to emerge early in development has important implications for our
  understanding of how the infant brain's organization can be shaped by early environmental
  factors. Aims: We attempt to describe RSFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) and to examine whether it adapts to early monolingual versus bilingual environments.
  We also present an fNIRS data preprocessing and analysis pipeline that can be used
  to reliably characterize RSFC in development and to reduce false positives and flawed
  results interpretations. Methods: We measured spontaneous hemodynamic brain activity
  in a large cohort ( N = 99 ) of 4-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants using
  fNIRS. We implemented group-level approaches based on independent component analysis
  to examine RSFC, while providing proper control for physiological confounds and
  multiple comparisons. Results: At the group level, we describe the functional organization
  of the 4-month-old infant brain in large-scale cortical networks. Unbiased group-level
  comparisons revealed no differences in RSFC between monolingual and bilingual infants
  at this age. Conclusions: High-quality fNIRS data provide a means to reliably describe
  RSFC patterns in the infant brain. The proposed group-level RSFC analyses allow
  to assess differences in RSFC across experimental conditions. An effect of early
  bilingual experience in RSFC was not observed, suggesting that adaptations might
  only emerge during explicit linguistic tasks, or at a later point in development.
