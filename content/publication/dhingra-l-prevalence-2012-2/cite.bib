 abstract = {Background: Chinese Americans are the largest Asian subgroup in the U.S., and many are recent immigrants with high rates of cancer, a leading cause of death for this population. Although Chinese American patients frequently present with advanced illness and poorly controlled pain, information on symptom burden in this population is very limited. As part of an ongoing community study to test the effectiveness of a rapid-cycle quality improvement (QI) intervention to enhance symptom management, we evaluated the prevalence and burden of cancer symptoms in a large sample of first-generation, non-English speaking, ethnic Chinese patients. Method(s): A consecutive sample of Chinese American patients in two large community-based oncology practices and one hospital-based practice in New York were screened for cancer symptoms. Eligible adults who self-identified as ethnic Chinese, spoke Cantonese or Mandarin as their primary language, and had a history of cancer completed translated instruments assessing symptom prevalence, severity, and distress administered by bilingual research assistants. The study was approved by the IRB at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Result(s): Of 1,018 cancer patients screened to date (62.2% women; M age = 64.0 years (SD = 13.7, range = 23 to 101); 20.6% reported persistent cancer pain for the past month. The most common cancers were breast (34.3%) lung (12.6%), and head and neck (11.8%) and 41.9% were undergoing active treatment. The mean worst pain intensity on a 0-10 numeric scale was 5.5 (SD = 2.2), with 34.4% rating their worst pain as \textgreater 6 of 10. Many (84.5%) reported other symptoms, including fatigue (54.4%), dry mouth (52.4%), difficulty sleeping (44.8%), and drowsiness (37.5%). Overall, 32.7% rated their symptoms as "quite a bit" or "very much" distressing, with sleep disturbance (33.1%), lack of appetite (31.3%), and constipation (29.2%) causing the most severe distress. Conclusion(s): Symptom burden is high among community-dwelling, economically-disadvantaged ethnic Chinese cancer patients. Our ongoing QI intervention may alleviate the high symptom rate in this population and clarify potential patient, provider, and system-related factors that are associated with symptom control outcomes.},
