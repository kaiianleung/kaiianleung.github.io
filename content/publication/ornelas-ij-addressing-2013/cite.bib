 abstract = {Purpose: Research suggests that Latino immigrant men face many difficulties in adapting to life in the United States with previous studies suggesting that heavy alcohol use is one coping mechanism in response. The aim of this study was to understand alcohol use and service needs among Latino immigrant men as a basis for development of an intervention to reduce heavy alcohol use in this population. Method(s): Latino immigrant men (N = 27) who were current drinkers and mental health and substance use providers (N = 13) were recruited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured 1:1 interviews. Data were collected in Spanish and English by trained bilingual research staff and recorded. Recordings were transcribed, then transcripts were coded and analyzed in Atlas.ti. Each transcript was coded by twomembers of the research staff. Case summaries and coded quotations were reviewed to identify themes. Result(s): Patterns of alcohol use included frequent drinking which often occurred daily or several times a week. Binge drinking was also common. Most men chose to drink at home or in "hidden" public areas where they would not be seen by authorities. Men were more likely to drink when feeling lonely, social isolated, and guilty about being away from their families. Men reported that drinking helped them feel stronger, and more confident, friendly and conversational. Some men reported wanting to decrease their drinking, but did not have support in their social networks and primarily coped with problems alone. Both providers and the men reported knowing about Alcoholics Anonymous, but did not feel comfortable going to meetings even though they stated a desire to seek treatment. Providers noted that there was a lack of substance use prevention and treatment programs focused on Latino immigrant men. Providers and male drinkers believed that screening and brief intervention offered in community settings (such as day labor worker centers, and community-based organizations) would be a culturally responsive and effective approach to reduce and prevent heavy drinking among Latino immigrantmen. Conclusion(s): Unhealthy drinking and negative consequences were common among this sample of Latino immigrantmen. As such, community based screening and intervention may help reduce heavy alcohol use in this vulnerable population.},
