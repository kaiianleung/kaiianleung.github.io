abstract: 'As the number of bilinguals in the USA grows rapidly, it is increasingly
  important for neuropsychologists to be equipped and trained to address the unique
  challenges inherent in conducting ethical and competent neuropsychological evaluations
  with this population. Research on bilingualism has focused on two key cognitive
  mechanisms that introduce differences between bilinguals and monolinguals: (a) reduced
  frequency of language-specific use (weaker links), and (b) competition for selection
  within the language system in bilinguals (interference). Both mechanisms are needed
  to explain how bilingualism affects neuropsychological test performance, including
  the robust bilingual disadvantages found on verbal tasks, and more subtle bilingual
  advantages on some measures of cognitive control. These empirical results and theoretical
  claims can be used to derive a theoretically informed method for assessing cognitive
  status in bilinguals. We present specific considerations for measuring degree of
  bilingualism for both clients and examiners to aid in determinations of approaches
  to testing bilinguals, with practical guidelines for incorporating models of bilingualism
  and recent experimental data into neuropsychological evaluations. This integrated
  approach promises to provide improved clinical services for bilingual clients, and
  will also contribute to a program of research that will ultimately reveal the mechanisms
  underlying language processing and executive functioning in bilinguals and monolinguals
  alike.'
