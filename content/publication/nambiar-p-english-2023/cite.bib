 abstract = {Purpose of Study: Amarillo has a culturally diverse refugee population. An estimated 4000 refugees have been accommodated by the US Refugee Resettlement Program with the help of Refugee Services of Texas and Catholic Charities as of December 2016. The Texas Tech faculty, medical students, and volunteers in association with local charities operate a bi-weekly introductory health screening clinic at the Amarillo International Market. The main barrier to this program is the language diversity the health care personnel face in communicating with the refugees and integrating them into the health care system. Methods Used: An exploratory qualitative design with a community-based research approach was adopted. The research team consisted of health care providers, medical students, and volunteers. The objective was to study the barriers to healthcare access among immigrants with limited or no English language proficiency. Volunteer groups screened 143 new refugees attending Amarillo Refugee Health Screening Project and 2-3 interpreters from the community to assist in translation services from December 2021 to March 2022. Summary of Results: Thematic analysis of healthcare providers and immigrants specified that limited language proficiency frequently delayed access to available healthcare services and interfered with developing a therapeutic relationship between the immigrant and the healthcare provider. Based on data collected from the Amarillo Refugee clinic, 72% of the refugees spoke the primary foreign language like Farsi, Arabic, Pashto. Approximately 54% had some English knowledge; however inadequate to communicate with the health care providers effectively. Conclusion(s): Immigrants from culturally diverse backgrounds live in Amarillo, Texas, with many challenges during the resettlement phase, influencing their access to healthcare services and health outcomes. The "Healthy Immigrant Effect" is when the immigrants arrive in the host nation, and their health is observed to deteriorate with increased length of stay in the host country is likely a possibility for the refugee population in Amarillo. Language barriers interfered with treatment adherence and the use of preventative and screening services, further delaying access to timely care, causing poor chronic disease management, and ultimately resulting in poor health outcomes. Language barriers also impeded effective communication between healthcare providers and the immigrants, leading to suboptimal care and dissatisfaction with the care received. Involving community interpreters, family members, or volunteers from within the immigrant population is being suggested as a solution to overcome the communication barriers to reduce the Healthy Immigrant effect.Copyright © 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.},
