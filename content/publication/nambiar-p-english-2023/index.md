abstract: 'Purpose of Study: Amarillo has a culturally diverse refugee population.
  An estimated 4000 refugees have been accommodated by the US Refugee Resettlement
  Program with the help of Refugee Services of Texas and Catholic Charities as of
  December 2016. The Texas Tech faculty, medical students, and volunteers in association
  with local charities operate a bi-weekly introductory health screening clinic at
  the Amarillo International Market. The main barrier to this program is the language
  diversity the health care personnel face in communicating with the refugees and
  integrating them into the health care system. Methods Used: An exploratory qualitative
  design with a community-based research approach was adopted. The research team consisted
  of health care providers, medical students, and volunteers. The objective was to
  study the barriers to healthcare access among immigrants with limited or no English
  language proficiency. Volunteer groups screened 143 new refugees attending Amarillo
  Refugee Health Screening Project and 2-3 interpreters from the community to assist
  in translation services from December 2021 to March 2022. Summary of Results: Thematic
  analysis of healthcare providers and immigrants specified that limited language
  proficiency frequently delayed access to available healthcare services and interfered
  with developing a therapeutic relationship between the immigrant and the healthcare
  provider. Based on data collected from the Amarillo Refugee clinic, 72% of the refugees
  spoke the primary foreign language like Farsi, Arabic, Pashto. Approximately 54%
  had some English knowledge; however inadequate to communicate with the health care
  providers effectively. Conclusion(s): Immigrants from culturally diverse backgrounds
  live in Amarillo, Texas, with many challenges during the resettlement phase, influencing
  their access to healthcare services and health outcomes. The \"Healthy Immigrant
  Effect\" is when the immigrants arrive in the host nation, and their health is observed
  to deteriorate with increased length of stay in the host country is likely a possibility
  for the refugee population in Amarillo. Language barriers interfered with treatment
  adherence and the use of preventative and screening services, further delaying access
  to timely care, causing poor chronic disease management, and ultimately resulting
  in poor health outcomes. Language barriers also impeded effective communication
  between healthcare providers and the immigrants, leading to suboptimal care and
  dissatisfaction with the care received. Involving community interpreters, family
  members, or volunteers from within the immigrant population is being suggested as
  a solution to overcome the communication barriers to reduce the Healthy Immigrant
  effect.Copyright Â© 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.'
