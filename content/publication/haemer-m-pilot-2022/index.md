abstract: 'Background: Hispanic children face marked disparities in childhood obesity
  prevalence and persistence, resulting in disproportionate morbidity and death in
  adulthood. Few childhood obesity interventions have been designed and tested in
  partnership with Hispanic families and safety-net clinics. The objective of this
  pragmatic pilot study was to assess preliminary effectiveness and guide design of
  an RCT of a novel whole-family program, HeLP (the Healthy Living Program, or La
  Vida Saludable). Method(s): HeLP is an intensive clinic-referred bilingual whole-family
  obesity prevention and treatment program delivered at recreation centers by teams
  of community fitness professionals and safety-net-clinicbased health educators.
  HeLP was designed in partnership with Hispanic families around the value Familism
  or Familismo. Safety-net providers trained in Motivational Interviewing refer families
  of children 2-16yrs with obesity (all caregivers and siblings). HeLP includes 12
  x 2hr group sessions over three months, followed by structured primary care visits.
  Topics include parenting, child feeding, nutrition, cooking, meal planning/shopping,
  fitness, and mindfulness. This study compared BMI trajectories of children (with
  and without obesity) from 1 year preto 1 year post-intervention, in terms of % of
  95th percentile (BMI%95). Result(s): Mean attendance was 8 of 12 sessions. 372 children
  had BMI measured clinically 1 year prior to HeLP, and 321(85%) had BMI measured
  1 year post-HeLP. 269 had obesity and 52 were siblings without obesity. 33% had
  severe obesity, 44% were female, and 71% had Spanish-speaking parents. Changes in
  mean(SD) BMI%95 by age group: 2-6yrs n=20 -8.0%(10.6%) p=0.06; 7-11yrs n=98 -5.3%(10.8%)
  ptextless0.001; and 12-16yrs n=95 -4.1%(9.8%) ptextless0.001. Siblings without obesity
  n=52 decreased -4.5%(11.6) ptextless0.001. Effects were similar between families
  with English and Spanish speaking parents. Conclusion(s): These pilot data suggest
  that HeLP, a whole-family intervention by clinic-community partnership, is well
  accepted and can prevent and treat obesity for children 2-16 years of age from Hispanic
  families with low income. This pilot data supports a recently commenced comparative
  effectiveness randomized controlled trial (R01DK130176) of the Healthy Living Program
  vs. best-practice primary care counseling.'
