abstract: "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative
  treatment for patients with blood disorders and genetic diseases. Approximately
  70% of the HSCTs currently performed in the United States use stems cells from an
  unrelated donor who donated voluntarily. Medical students (MS) are a young, diverse,
  influential population whose willingness to engage in altruistic acts, such as donating
  stem cells, may be correlated with knowledge on the topic. A literature gap exists
  in MS perspectives towards HSCT and the bone marrow registry (BMR) and prior studies
  suggest that misconceptions about donation deter MS from participation on the BMR,
  which may decrease opportunities to educate other potential donors. We performed
  a cross-sectional survey among the 4-year cohort of MS at Mayo Medical School in
  Rochester, Minnesota. The questionnaire evaluated multiple areas including whether
  MS were current members of the BMR and/or prior blood donors, MS current knowledge
  on donor eligibility (DE) and the donation process (DP), MS familiarity with HSCT
  and the DP, and MS attitudes towards joining the BMR and towards donating stem cells.
  The responses were analyzed and assessed alongside a self-reported, standardized
  scale measuring students' altruistic behaviors. There were 99 out of 247 potential
  respondents (40%), with 45% (n = 44) of MS in preclinical years 1 or 2, 37% (n = 37)
  in clinical years 3 or 4, and 18% (n = 18) in research or alternative portions of
  their training, of which 43% (n = 41) in total were current BMR members. BMR status
  correlated positively with prior blood donation (P = .015) and female sex (P = .014).
  Respondents had a 57.7% and 63.7% average correct response rate regarding knowledge
  of DE and DP, respectively, with knowledge of DE not surprisingly higher in BMR
  members (P textless .0001). The majority of MS surveyed, 68% (n = 65), had learned
  about HSCT during medical school. BMR status correlated with the following attitudes
  towards donating stem cells: lower concern with all evaluated aspects of HSCT—time,
  cost, pain, and side effects (for all subsections, P textless .05) but not with
  the altruism score (P = .32). The mean altruism score for respondents was 59.9 ± 11.3
  (of a possible 100 points) with no significant difference in age, race, sex, level
  of training, or participation in the BMR. Altruism scores did not directly correlate
  with lower concern with aspects of time, cost, and pain of HSCT but did with long-term
  side effects (P = .021). This latter correlation was regardless of BMR status. Among
  MS, positive predictors for participation in the BMR included prior blood donation
  and female sex. BMR status did not ensure knowledge of all aspects of donating stem
  cells, but it correlated with less concern regarding the DP and was unrelated to
  altruism score. Improving knowledge gaps regarding the BMR and HSCT for the next
  generation of physicians and health care providers through expanded medical education
  curriculum may be beneficial to for the recruitment and retention of donor populations
  to the BMR."
