 abstract = {Introduction: Reproductive health (RH) disparities have been described between migrants and the Swiss population. The study COMIRES (COmmunity MIgrant RESearch) aims to understand barriers to RH services for migrant women and the role of the community using a community-participatory approach. Method(s): Between July 2014 and June 2015, 13 focus groups were conducted in 7 different languages in 6 migrant communities in Geneva. A semi-structured interview guide explored women's experience and transcripts translated to French were thematically coded using ATLAS.ti. Most of the 78 participants from 21 countries, aged in between 18 - 66 years, were married, had children and lived in Switzerland since 3 months up to 24 years. Result(s): Three major themes explaining barriers were identified: 1.access to RH services (e.g. lack of interpreters, absence of information) 2.socio-economic barriers (e.g. costs, legal status) 3.negative emotional feelings (taboo of the female body, feeling of stigmatisation). Conclusion(s): Despite Switzerland's high-quality RH-care, migrant women require additional assistance to access services. Besides the improvement of health literacy, the development of a culturally sensitive health environment and the availability of interpreters are essential to reduce barriers. The community-based approach helps not only to understand barriers, it also improves trust of the participants towards the university hospital and suggests solutions for better access to RH services. In a follow-up, a mixed-method study explored maternity experiences of 420 women during pregnancy in Geneva and Zurich using a structured questionnaire. As data collection were finalised only end of October 2016, preliminary data might be presented in March 2017.},
