abstract: The National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy emphasizes the importance
  of community-based opportunities for education, such as English as a second language
  (ESL) programs. It recommends collaborations among the adult literacy and ESL communities.
  However, limited attention has been given to researching the effectiveness of community-based
  interventions that combine ESL and health literacy. The purpose of this study was
  to explore the feasibility of using different community settings for improving health
  literacy among adult Spanish speakers through an English language program. The study
  used a pre-experimental, single arm pretest-posttest design, and implemented the
  Health Literacy and ESL Curriculum. A collaborative was established between the
  community and university researchers. Participants were recruited at three distinctive
  sites. Health literacy was assessed using the Spanish version of the Test of Functional
  Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA). Analysis included descriptive and paired-group
  t test. Forty-nine participants completed the intervention and post-tests (92% retention
  rate). Overall--all sites--posttest scores significantly improved for total TOFHLA,
  raw numeracy, and reading comprehension (p textless 0.0001). Similarly, all three
  sites yielded significantly better mean differences for the total TOFHLA score while
  numeracy and reading comprehension significantly improved in some sites. Results
  suggest that community sites are viable venues for delivering health literacy/language
  instruction to Spanish speaking adults. The study also points to community engagement
  and ESL programs as two essential components of effective health literacy interventions
  among Spanish speakers.
