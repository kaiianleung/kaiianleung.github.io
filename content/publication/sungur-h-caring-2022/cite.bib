 abstract = {Background: Due to various socio-cultural and language related factors, healthcare providers experience barriers when communicating with older culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients with cancer, which can lower the quality of care received by patients and negatively impact healthcare providers. Studies focusing on communication barriers of older CALD patients with cancer and a systematic comparison of those barriers between different healthcare providers have been largely missing. Objective(s): In order to lay out the healthcare providers' perceived barriers to communication, the present study identified and compared communication barriers among different healthcare providers when caring for older CALD patients with cancer. Method(s): An online survey was conducted among healthcare providers in the Netherlands who identified as being involved in the care of CALD patients with cancer (N = 191), specifically; GPs (NGPs = 54), specialists (Nspecialists = 29), oncology nurses (Nnurses = 77), and pharmacists (Npharmacists = 31). Providers assessed twelve pre-specified factors on (i) importance and (ii) frequency of these factors as barriers to communication. A composite score by employing the QUOTE (Quality Of care Through the patients' Eyes) methodology was used to rank, and classify factors as either potential or influential barriers. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Overall, low Dutch language proficiency of older CALD patients with cancer, family interpreters providing inadequate translations, not knowing the extent of patients' informational needs, cultural differences in views about healthcare (i.e., illnesses and treatments) and family members blocking communication were found to be influential communication barriers. Healthcare providers showed several differences in what they perceived to be a potential or an influential barrier: Cultural differences in views about healthcare and patients getting treatment in their home countries were important barriers for GPs, while not knowing the patient's contact person was for pharmacists. Nurses perceived the highest number of influential barriers, while specialists perceived the least. We conclude that specific interventions that address differences in perceived barriers among providers are needed, and we highlight potential interventions that involve digital communication tools, such as the Conversation Starter.Copyright © 2022},
