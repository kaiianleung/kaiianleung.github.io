abstract: Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual
  identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they
  believe they are hearing. Following Gonzales, Byers-Heinlein, and Lotto (2019),
  we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based
  cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English
  adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions participants identified
  the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually via
  the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners
  categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing
  English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, ‘voiceless’ responses
  increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double
  phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing
  selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.
