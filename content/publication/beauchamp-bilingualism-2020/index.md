abstract: Preschool-aged bilingual children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can
  keep pace with their monolingual peers with ASD. However, can older children with
  ASD continue to do so as language demands become greater? Also, can they reach language
  levels similar to those of neurotypically developing (ND) bilingual children? The
  current study compares the language abilities of 3 school-aged bilingual children
  with ASD to those of 2 monolingual peers, and 19 ND bilingual and 12 ND monolingual
  peers. Using cluster analyses, we found that bilingual children with ASD had similar
  language to those of monolingual children with ASD and neurotypically developing
  bilingual and monolingual children. Results suggest that bilingual children with
  ASD can keep pace with their peers with similar intellectual abilities.
