 abstract = {Despite the existence of numerous efficacious treatments for mental disorders, many individuals in need do not receive adequate treatment particularly racial and ethnic minorities. Community stakeholders can provide: (1) a more nuanced understanding of community mental health needs, and in (2) informing the planning and provision of mental health services. Qualitative data for this mental health needs assessment come from 61 individuals who represent local residents and/or consumers of mental health services, Executive Directors, providers of mental health and non-mental health community based services. We identified systems-related and psychosocial barriers to seeking mental health services: difficulty navigating the mental health system, language barriers, dearth of culturally competent providers; and mental health stigma and mental health literacy and non-Western notions of mental health. Collaborative efforts across stakeholders are called for to address the mental health needs of racial and ethnic minorities in a local community.},
