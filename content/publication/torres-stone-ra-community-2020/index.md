abstract: 'Despite the existence of numerous efficacious treatments for mental disorders,
  many individuals in need do not receive adequate treatment particularly racial and
  ethnic minorities. Community stakeholders can provide: (1) a more nuanced understanding
  of community mental health needs, and in (2) informing the planning and provision
  of mental health services. Qualitative data for this mental health needs assessment
  come from 61 individuals who represent local residents and/or consumers of mental
  health services, Executive Directors, providers of mental health and non-mental
  health community based services. We identified systems-related and psychosocial
  barriers to seeking mental health services: difficulty navigating the mental health
  system, language barriers, dearth of culturally competent providers; and mental
  health stigma and mental health literacy and non-Western notions of mental health.
  Collaborative efforts across stakeholders are called for to address the mental health
  needs of racial and ethnic minorities in a local community.'
