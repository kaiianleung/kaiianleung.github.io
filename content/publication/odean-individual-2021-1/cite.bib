 abstract = {The current study explores whether individual differences in the dimensional adjectives (e.g., big, tall) children understand, relates to individual differences in two non-verbal spatial abilities, an extrinsic spatial task (i.e., spatial scaling) and an intrinsic spatial task (i.e., mental rotation) in two studies that looked at spatial scaling and mental transformations respectively. Ninety-two Spanish-English bilingual children between 37.65 and 71.87 months (42 male) participated in Study 1 and with 79 of the children aged 48- to 72-months (40 male) also participating in study 2. Results show number of dimensional adjectives preschool children comprehend utilizing a new interactive, tablet-based task relates to performance on non-verbal spatial tasks. Children may use language when solving spatial tasks, or language may be indicative of overall stronger understanding of spatial relations.},
