abstract: Low cervical cancer screening rates among Vietnamese American women have
  been attributed, in part, to inadequate knowledge about cervical cancer and health
  beliefs that hinder screening. A community-based educational program was developed
  to improve knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer screening in this underserved
  population. It was hypothesized that the program would result in increases in knowledge,
  as well as enhanced health beliefs and self-efficacy toward obtaining cervical cancer
  screening. Using a group-randomized design, 1488 women from 30 Vietnamese community-based
  organizations were assigned to either the intervention (n=816) or control (n=672)
  conditions. The intervention group received cervical cancer education delivered
  by bilingual community health educators. Intervention content addressed individual
  beliefs and expectancies regarding cervical cancer screening (e.g., perceived risk
  of developing cervical cancer; perceived benefits and barriers to screening; social
  and cultural norms regarding screening). The control group received general health
  education, including information about cancer screening. Knowledge and health beliefs
  were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Among women in the intervention
  group, overall knowledge about cervical cancer and screening guidelines increased
  from pre- to post-program (30% vs. 88%, ptextless0.001), perceived benefits of screening
  increased (3.50 vs. 4.49, ptextless0.001), and perceived barriers to screening decreased
  (3.13 vs. 2.25, ptextless0.001). Changes in knowledge and health beliefs were not
  observed among women in the control group. A community-based educational program
  can help increase knowledge about cervical cancer and screening, promote positive
  changes in women's beliefs about the benefits of cervical cancer screening, and
  reduce perceived barriers to screening. Such programs may play an important role
  in addressing health disparities and informing underserved populations about recommended
  screening tests.
