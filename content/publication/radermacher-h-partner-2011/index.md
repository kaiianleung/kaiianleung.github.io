abstract: Given an Australian national and state policy agenda that continues to promote
  collaborative work, many community organisations are attempting to engage in partnerships
  with mixed results. This paper reports on a qualitative study conducted to explore
  the experiences of existing partnerships between organisations and small community
  groups who deliver community based support services to older people from culturally
  diverse backgrounds. In particular, this study sought to identify the key factors
  that facilitate and hinder the formation, maintenance and effectiveness of partnerships
  within the ethnic and multicultural community aged care (EMCAC) sector. Fourteen
  participants representing nine community and health service organisations located
  in the Melbourne metropolitan area took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants
  reported that partnerships between organisations are necessary and beneficial within
  the EMCAC sector. Organisational capacity, access to information and guidelines,
  and the inequality experienced by smaller organisations were key issues identified
  by participants. Increasing organisational capacity and reducing the inequalities
  experienced in partnerships may be addressed via training and education about the
  nature of partnerships, as well as by advocating for increased resources to smaller
  ethno-specific organisations. Further investigation is required to examine whether
  not engaging in partnerships will deem an organisation unsustainable in the longer
  term. Â© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
