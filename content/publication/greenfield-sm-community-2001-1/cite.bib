 abstract = {The United Kingdom (UK) population is diverse with nearly 6% minority ethnic communities. Both patients and doctors experience difficulties when dealing with someone from a different ethnic group. Medical education has failed to keep pace with the changing needs of the diverse population. We report a project in which 12 established (religious/cultural and specific interest) community groups expressed their views on what future doctors should learn about serving diverse populations. Data were obtained by group discussion and through the media using a structured format. Fifteen themes emerged which were grouped under three broad themes: firstly, the identification by group members of their perception of the 'differences' in social and cultural beliefs and behaviours of their individual community; secondly, the identification of characteristics of a culturally sensitive doctor; and lastly, recommendations for changes in medical training. New teaching has been introduced to the medical curriculum that incorporates the themes raised by the communities and which reflects consciousness raising and communication issues.
