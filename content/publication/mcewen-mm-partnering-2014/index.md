abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to refine and expand a culturally
  tailored individual-level diabetes self-management intervention to a family-level
  intervention., METHODS: Using community-based participatory research principles,
  Mexican American adults (n = 12) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and family
  members (n = 12) in the United States-Mexico border region participated in 6 focus
  group interviews, conducted by bilingual, bicultural facilitators. Facilitators
  and barriers to T2DM management were identified. Transcripts were analyzed using
  qualitative content analysis., RESULTS: Through an iterative analysis process, 5
  categories represented participants with T2DM: (1) strategies my family can use
  to support our managing T2DM, (2) be sensitive to my challenges, (3) stop telling
  me what to eat or do, (4) how can we peacefully coexist, and (5) I feel supported.
  Categories identified by family members were (1) changing behaviors together, (2)
  sharing not controlling, (3) supporting positive behaviors, and (4) your behaviors
  frustrate me., CONCLUSIONS: The family was reinforced as a major influence for successful
  T2DM management. Family support requires that families value and develop knowledge
  and skills for T2DM management. This family intervention builds on family assets
  and relationships, shifting from traditional externally motivated individual models
  to create a shared commitment to manage T2DM among Mexican American adults.Copyright
