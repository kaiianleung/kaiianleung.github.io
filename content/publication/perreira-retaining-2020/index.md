abstract: 'We aimed to examine the retention of Hispanics/Latinos participating in
  the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a prospective cohort
  study of 16,415 adults in 4 US cities who were enrolled between 2008 and 2011. We
  summarized retention strategies and examined contact, response, and participation
  rates over 5 years of annual follow-up interviews. We then evaluated motivations
  for participation and satisfaction with retention efforts among participants who
  completed a second in-person interview approximately 6 years after their baseline
  interview. Finally, we conducted logistic regression analyses estimating associations
  of demographic, health, and interview characteristics at study visit 1 (baseline)
  with participation, high motivation, and high satisfaction at visit 2. Across 5
  years, the HCHS/SOL maintained contact, response, and participation rates over 80%.
  The most difficult Hispanic/Latino populations to retain included young, single,
  US-born males with less than a high school education. At visit 2, we found high
  rates of motivation and satisfaction. HCHS/SOL participants primarily sought to
  help their community and learn more about their health. High rates of retention
  of Hispanics/Latinos can be facilitated through the employment of bilingual/bicultural
  staff and the development of culturally tailored retention materials. Copyright
