  transfusion is an intervention widely used in therapeutics (e.g., in the perioperative
  period), thus, knowledge about factors associated with blood donation is important.
  The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of sociodemographic factors,
  personal values and life satisfaction on blood donation in Poland.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectextgreatertextlesssectextgreatertextlesstitletextgreaterMethodstextless/titletextgreatertextlessptextgreaterSecondary
  analysis of data. A multiple logistic regression was carried out to assess the relationship
  between sociodemographic factors, life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale),
  personal values (Personal Values List) and blood donation.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectextgreatertextlesssectextgreatertextlesstitletextgreaterResultstextless/titletextgreatertextlessptextgreaterOf
  the 770 respondents aged 18–65 years, 262 respondents (34%) donated blood at least
  once in their lives. Respondents who believed that blood donation is safe (OR =
  1.71; Cl95%: 1.20 to 2.43), were male (OR = 1.47; Cl95%: 1.26 to 1.72), married
  (OR = 1.31; Cl95%: 1.11 to 1.54) and those with high school education (OR = 0.81;
  Cl95%: 0.66 to 0.99) were more often blood donors.textless/ptextgreatertextless/sectextgreatertextlesssectextgreatertextlesstitletextgreaterConclusiontextless/titletextgreatertextlessptextgreaterPerceived
  blood donation safety and sociodemographic factors such as gender, marital status,
