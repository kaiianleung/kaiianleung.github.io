abstract: Mental health services are increasingly encouraged to use co-design methodologies
  to engage individuals and families affected by mental health problems in service
  design and improvement. This scoping review aimed to identify research that used
  co-design methods with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities
  in mental health services, and to identify methodological considerations for working
  with this population. In October 2019, we searched five electronic databases (CINAHL,
  PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science) to identify papers published in which
  people from CALD backgrounds were engaged in the co-design of a mental health service
  or program. Searches were limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English
  in the last 25 years (1993-2019). The search identified nine articles that matched
  the inclusion criteria. Using a scoping review methodology, the first author charted
  the data using extraction fields and then used qualitative synthesis methods to
  identify themes. Data were grouped into themes relevant to the research question.
  The two key themes relate first, to improving the experience for CALD communities
  when engaging in co-design research and second, to the development of co-design
  methods themselves. These findings support the need for further research into the
  transferability of co-design tools with CALD communities, particularly if co-design
  is to become a best practice method for service design and improvement. This scoping
  review identified methodological and practical consideration for researchers looking
  to use co-design with CALD communities for mental health service design, re-design
  or quality improvement initiatives. Further research is required to explore experiences
  of co-design methods, including documented protocols such as experience-based co-design,
  with CALD communities. This review indicates that explanatory models of mental health,
  community and co-design impact partnerships with CALD communities, and need to be
  understood to optimise the quality of these relationships when using co-design methods.Copyright
