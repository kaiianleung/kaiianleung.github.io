abstract: The methods of ethnography and action research have much to offer to the
  field of speech-language pathology, particularly as our clinical populations are
  becoming increasingly diverse. We suggest that practicing speech-language pathologists
  and students, as well as researchers, will benefit from strategies that use the
  methods of participatory action research and ethnography as guiding principles to
  their work. Ethnography seeks to discover meaningful structures in a culture from
  the perspective of those whose culture it is. Action research, which shares a methodological
  basis with ethnography, is undertaken with the aim of improving the functioning
  of the social institution, practice, or structure investigated for the benefit of
  those most closely involved with that institution or practice. By way of illustration,
  we use data collected during fieldwork in Louisiana, involving persons with dementia
  from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds. Copyright Â© 2009 by Thieme
