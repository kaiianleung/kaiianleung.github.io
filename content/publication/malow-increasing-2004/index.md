abstract: This article describes an HIV prevention study among Haitian youths, based
  on the cultural adaptation of a cognitive behavioral HIV risk reduction intervention
  entitled \"Becoming a Responsible Teen.\" The aim of the parent study is to evaluate
  whether the BART intervention is more effective than a control condition in reducing
  HIV risk behavior in the target population. The project explores how self-efficacy,
  behavioral intentions, social factors and acculturation influence the risk behavior
  of Haitian American adolescents. This community based translation of a risk reduction
  intervention, previously found to be effective in other populations, can serve as
  a model for reducing health disparities in a vulnerable adolescent population that
  lacks access to preventive health care. The purpose of this paper is to present
  preliminary data from the pre-assessment phase of the intervention, which enabled
  the project to incorporate health disparity issues with this population and address
  barriers to health care access.
