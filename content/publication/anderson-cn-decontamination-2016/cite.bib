 abstract = {Purpose: While there is an abundance of research on the after effects of the 3.11 triple disaster on subsets of affected individuals, including nuclear power plant workers, there is a dearth of literature examining the experiences of those who remain internally displaced by the disaster. This project was designed to create a visual and oral narrative of the daily lives of internally displaced individuals in Fukushima, Japan. Method(s): Using Photovoice, a community based participatory research method that uses documentary photography and storytelling, seven residents of the Onodai temporary housing shelter underwent three rounds of photo-taking during July, 2015. Each round of photos was followed by individual in-depth interviews, and group discussions. Bilingual medical students acted as translators during the interview process. The English portions of each interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using grounded theory to identify broad categories that were then refined to generate consistent themes. Outcome & Evaluation: The resident's stories, elicited by the photographs they took, showed how the long-term effects of the disaster manifested as a series of juxtapositions in their lives. Several participants reported feeling torn between their loss of purpose, as their farmland was destroyed, and their enjoyment of new-found leisure time. They also reported that while they enjoyed the sense of community that they had within the temporary housing shelter, they often felt stifled by the new level of physical proximity to their neighbors. Finally, they reported feeling that nature, with which they reported having close communion, had been tarnished by the radiation that now covered their homes, forests, and fields. All participants, however, reported a desire to build a better life, either by building new homes in areas that had not been affected by the radiation, or by rebuilding their lives and legacies in their hometown. Going Forward: This small study may give some insight into the feelings of internally displaced Japanese people in the wake of this disaster, and may hopefully inform the efforts of those who are attempting to aid in this recovery.},
