abstract: "Purpose: While there is an abundance of research on the after effects of
  the 3.11 triple disaster on subsets of affected individuals, including nuclear power
  plant workers, there is a dearth of literature examining the experiences of those
  who remain internally displaced by the disaster. This project was designed to create
  a visual and oral narrative of the daily lives of internally displaced individuals
  in Fukushima, Japan. Method(s): Using Photovoice, a community based participatory
  research method that uses documentary photography and storytelling, seven residents
  of the Onodai temporary housing shelter underwent three rounds of photo-taking during
  July, 2015. Each round of photos was followed by individual in-depth interviews,
  and group discussions. Bilingual medical students acted as translators during the
  interview process. The English portions of each interview was transcribed verbatim
  and analyzed using grounded theory to identify broad categories that were then refined
  to generate consistent themes. Outcome & Evaluation: The resident's stories, elicited
  by the photographs they took, showed how the long-term effects of the disaster manifested
  as a series of juxtapositions in their lives. Several participants reported feeling
  torn between their loss of purpose, as their farmland was destroyed, and their enjoyment
  of new-found leisure time. They also reported that while they enjoyed the sense
  of community that they had within the temporary housing shelter, they often felt
  stifled by the new level of physical proximity to their neighbors. Finally, they
  reported feeling that nature, with which they reported having close communion, had
  been tarnished by the radiation that now covered their homes, forests, and fields.
  All participants, however, reported a desire to build a better life, either by building
  new homes in areas that had not been affected by the radiation, or by rebuilding
  their lives and legacies in their hometown. Going Forward: This small study may
  give some insight into the feelings of internally displaced Japanese people in the
  wake of this disaster, and may hopefully inform the efforts of those who are attempting
  to aid in this recovery."
