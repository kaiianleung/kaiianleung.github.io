abstract: In the United States, approximately 78% of agricultural farmworkers are
  immigrants. In Oregon, a growing number of these farmworkers are indigenous and
  speak an indigenous language as their primary language. This group of farmworkers
  suffers from linguistic, cultural and geographic isolation and faces a unique set
  of challenges yet little has been done to identify their health needs. Using data
  from focus groups, partners from this community-based participatory research project
  examined indigenous farmworkers' concerns regarding occupational injury and illness,
  experiences of discrimination and disrespect, and language and cultural barriers.
  The data revealed examples of disrespect and discrimination based on the languages
  and cultures of indigenous farmworkers, and a lack of basic occupational health
  and safety information and equipment. For example, participants mentioned that occupational
  safety information was inaccessible because it was rarely provided in indigenous
  languages, and participants felt there were no legal means to protect farmworkers
  from occupational hazards. Community-based strategies designed to address the occupational
  health status of farmworkers must consider the unique circumstances of those farmworkers
  who do not speak Spanish or English. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.
