 abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 2011-2014 CATIE developed an Ethnocultural Hepatitis C Outreach project that produced in-language hepatitis C resources and a media campaign for four major immigrant communities living in Ontario: Pakistani, Punjabi, Chinese and Filipino. PURPOSE: Of all the hepatitis C infections reported in Canada, 35 per cent are estimated to be among immigrants (PHAC, 2014). Immigrants also face cultural and linguistic barriers to healthcare, and in Canada immigrant health is shown to decline over time. In-language resources and community development are required to engage these communities in health issues. METHOD(S): The project was developed through partnership and community consultation including community advisory councils. The project implemented a multi-level strategy including education, outreach and social marketing. The education component included facilitator training, a multilingual website, in-language workshops and brochures. Educational tools developed include puzzles, case studies and curriculum. The outreach component included community partnerships and event outreach. The social marketing component included a media campaign across four communities, in print, radio and online. Evaluation activities included collecting key performance indicators (to measure the type and quantity of work performed) and in-person evaluation forms for workshops. RESULT(S): Education: yourlanguage.hepcinfo.ca has hepatitis C information in 9 languages and receives over 1000 visits monthly. Between 2012-2014 43 in-language workshops reached 877 people. Multilingual brochures are available in 6 languages and 16621 have been distributed. Outreach: The project has partnered with 20 organizations. Event outreach each year reaches over 2000 people. Social Marketing: Three waves of a hepatitis C awareness campaign have run in up to 26 ethnocultural print, radio and online outlets. Editorial content was also produced including articles, radio interviews and tv programs. CONCLUSION(S): Meaningful partnership, community engagement and a strong interest to raise awareness of hepatitis C within immigrant communities facilitated the project's success and reach.},
