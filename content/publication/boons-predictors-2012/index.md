abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Although deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) are able
  to develop good language skills, the large variability in outcomes remains a significant
  concern. The first aim of this study was to evaluate language skills in children
  with CIs to establish benchmarks. The second aim was to make an estimation of the
  optimal age at implantation to provide maximal opportunities for the child to achieve
  good language skills afterward. The third aim was to gain more insight into the
  causes of variability to set recommendations for optimizing the rehabilitation process
  of prelingually deaf children with CIs., DESIGN: Receptive and expressive language
  development of 288 children who received CIs by age five was analyzed in a retrospective
  multicenter study. Outcome measures were language quotients (LQs) on the Reynell
  Developmental Language Scales and Schlichting Expressive Language Test at 1, 2,
  and 3 years after implantation. Independent predictive variables were nine child-related,
  environmental, and auditory factors. A series of multiple regression analyses determined
  the amount of variance in expressive and receptive language outcomes attributable
  to each predictor when controlling for the other variables., RESULTS: Simple linear
  regressions with age at first fitting and independent samples t tests demonstrated
  that children implanted before the age of two performed significantly better on
  all tests than children who were implanted at an older age. The mean LQ was 0.78
  with an SD of 0.18. A child with an LQ lower than 0.60 (= 0.78-0.18) within 3 years
  after implantation was labeled as a weak performer compared with other deaf children
  implanted before the age of two. Contralateral stimulation with a second CI or a
  hearing aid and the absence of additional disabilities were related to better language
  outcomes. The effect of environmental factors, comprising multilingualism, parental
  involvement, and communication mode increased over time. Three years after implantation,
  the total multiple regression model accounted for 52% of the variance in receptive
  language scores and 58% of the variance in expressive language scores., CONCLUSIONS:
  On the basis of language test scores of this large group of children, an LQ of 0.60
  or lower was considered a risk criterion for problematic language development compared
  with other deaf children using CIs. Children attaining LQs below 0.60 should be
  monitored more closely and perhaps their rehabilitation programs should be reconsidered.
  Improved language outcomes were related to implantation under the age of two, contralateral
  stimulation, monolingualism, sufficient involvement of the parents, and oral communication
  by the parents. The presence of an additional learning disability had a negative
  influence on language development. Understanding these causes of variation can help
  clinicians and parents to create the best possible circumstances for children with
  CIs to acquire language.'
