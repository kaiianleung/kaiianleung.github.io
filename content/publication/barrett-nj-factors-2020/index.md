abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Engaging diverse populations in biomedical research, including
  biospecimen donation, remains a national challenge. This study examined factors
  associated with an invitation to participate in biomedical research, intent to participate
  in biomedical research in the future, and participation in biomedical research and
  biospecimen donation among a diverse, multilingual, community-based sample across
  3 distinct geographic areas. METHOD(S): Three National Cancer Institute-designated
  cancer centers engaged in community partnerships to develop and implement population
  health assessments, reaching a convenience sample of 4343 participants spanning
  their respective catchment areas. Data harmonization, multiple imputation, and multivariable
  logistic modeling were used. RESULT(S): African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and
  other racial minority groups were more likely to be offered opportunities to participate
  in biomedical research compared to whites. Access to care, history of cancer, educational
  level, survey language, nativity, and rural residence also influenced opportunity,
  intent, and actual participation in biomedical research. CONCLUSION(S): Traditionally
  underserved racial and ethnic groups reported heightened opportunity and interest
  in participating in biomedical research. Well-established community partnerships
  and long-standing community engagement around biomedical research led to a diverse
  sample being reached at each site and may in part explain the current study findings.
  However, this study illustrates an ongoing need to establish trust and diversify
  biomedical research participation through innovative and tailored approaches. National
  Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers have the potential to increase opportunities
  for diverse participation in biomedical research through community partnerships
  and engagement. Additional work remains to identify and address system-level and
  individual-level barriers to participation in both clinical trials and biospecimen
  donation for research.Copyright Â© 2020 American Cancer Society.'
