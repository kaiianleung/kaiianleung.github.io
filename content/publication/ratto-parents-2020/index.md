abstract: More dual language learners (DLLs) are being identified early with autism
  spectrum disorder (ASD). However, many families are still being advised against
  dual language exposure, despite a lack of evidence of negative impacts on language
  development in ASD. Research in typically developing children has noted advantages
  for bilinguals in domains such as executive functioning and social skills, but less
  is known about the effects in ASD. The present study evaluated differences in executive
  functioning and social communication in young children (n = 55) with ASD. Dual-language
  learners with ASD had significantly fewer parent reported executive functioning
  problems and repetitive behaviors; parent-reported social communication skills were
  generally comparable across groups. Our findings indicate that the bilingual advantage
  in executive functioning may extend to children with neurodevelopmental conditions.
