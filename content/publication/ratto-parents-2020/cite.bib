 abstract = {More dual language learners (DLLs) are being identified early with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, many families are still being advised against dual language exposure, despite a lack of evidence of negative impacts on language development in ASD. Research in typically developing children has noted advantages for bilinguals in domains such as executive functioning and social skills, but less is known about the effects in ASD. The present study evaluated differences in executive functioning and social communication in young children (n = 55) with ASD. Dual-language learners with ASD had significantly fewer parent reported executive functioning problems and repetitive behaviors; parent-reported social communication skills were generally comparable across groups. Our findings indicate that the bilingual advantage in executive functioning may extend to children with neurodevelopmental conditions.},
