abstract: Recently renamed \"Listening to Ethnic Communities about Diabetes\", this
  project was a winner of the 2003 Innovation and Excellence in Primary Health Care
  Award, Community and Consumer Participation category. The project is also being
  promoted as a model of best practice in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD)
  community engagement. Listening to Ethnic Communities about Diabetes focused on
  Type 2 diabetes by developing, piloting and evaluating culturally appropriate primary
  and secondary prevention health promotion strategies with Maltese, Filipino and
  Vietnamese communities in the municipality of Brimbank, Victoria. One of the critical
  success factors for the project was that, while the project was grounded in a health
  promotion framework, the lead agency did not have a great deal of health expertise.
  Rather, the focus of its expertise was on relationships with ethnic communities.
  This allowed for a shift in traditional power structures as the communities were
  given a real voice and decision-making powers. While the health service providers
  had the clinical and practical knowledge and expertise in diabetes, it was the involvement
  of the ethno-specific organisations and ethnic community representatives that enabled
  the project to develop and pilot models of service provision which had relevance
  and accessibility to the target community. The project also demonstrated the value
  in utilising a diverse range of strategies that reflect the cultural practices and
  preferences of the target communities through being developed and tested in partnership
  with the communities.
