abstract: "Introduction: Despite evidence that Hispanic/Latino populations are 1.5
  times more likely than non-Latino Whites to develop Alzheimer's disease and related
  dementias (ADRD), Latinos are underrepresented in clinical trials testing treatments
  for ADRD. Data are needed on facilitators of ADRD clinical trial participation in
  Latinos. We leveraged in-depth qualitative methods to elucidate barriers and facilitators
  to participating in ADRD clinical trials in a large and diverse sample of Latinos;
  and to provide timely and actionable strategies to accelerate representation of
  Latinos in clinical trials on ADRD. Method(s): Data were collected in California
  between January 2019 and June 2020 from 25 focus groups (FGs): eight with Latino
  adults ages 18 to 49 (n = 54), nine with Latino adults ages 50+ (n = 75), and eight
  with caregivers of Latino older adults with ADRD (n = 52). Twelve community-based
  organization administrators were also interviewed. Transcripts of FGs and interviews
  were entered into Atlas.ti software. Three independent team members analyzed the
  transcripts with inductive/deductive qualitative content analysis. We triangulated
  data from stakeholder groups across sites, we used collaborative coding, and used
  the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Result(s): An overarching
  theme was a tension between wanting to learn more about ADRD and to participate
  in ADRD research but having limited awareness and opportunity. Five themes were
  identified: (1) remaining in limbo, (2) wanting information about ADRD, (3) wanting
  information on research about ADRD, (4) clearing researchers through trusted local
  organizations, and (5) practicing altruism through engagement in research opportunities.
  Discussion(s): To increase representation of Latino communities in clinical trials
  on ADRD, bilingual information and education on ADRD and clinical trials needs to
  be better disseminated. Also, working with trusted local, regional, and national
  organizations can increase participation. Importantly, Latino participation can
  increase when research teams demonstrate altruistic actions and inform participants
  of public health reasons requiring their involvement. HIGHLIGHTS: Participation
  in clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is limited
  among Latinos/Hispanics. Knowing the high prevalence of ADRD in Latinos increases
  willingness to participate. Observing altruism from researchers increases willingness
  to participate. Invitations from multiple organizations increases willingness to
  participate. Researchers should include public health reasons requiring Latinos'
  involvement.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational
