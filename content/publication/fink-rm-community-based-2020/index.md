abstract: 'Background: Widespread community engagement in advance care planning (ACP)
  is needed to overcome barriers to ACP implementation. Objective(s): Develop, implement,
  and evaluate a model for community-based ACP in rural populations with low English
  language fluency and health care access using lay patient navigators. Design(s):
  A statewide initiative to improve ACP setting/subjects-trained in a group session
  approach, bilingual patient navigators facilitated 1-hour English and Spanish ACP
  sessions discussing concerns about choosing a surrogate decision maker and completing
  an advance directive (AD). Participants received bilingual informational materials,
  including Frequently Asked Questions, an AD in English or Spanish, and Goal Setting
  worksheet. Measurement: Participants completed a program evaluation and 4-item ACP
  Engagement Survey (ACP-4) postsession. Result(s): For 18 months, 74 ACP sessions
  engaged 1034 participants in urban, rural, and frontier areas of the state; 39%
  were ethnically diverse, 69% female. A nurse or physician co-facilitated 49% of
  sessions. Forty-seven percent of participants completed an ACP-4 with 29% planning
  to name a decision maker in the next 6 months and 21% in the next 30 days; 31% were
  ready to complete an AD in the next 6 months and 22% in the next 30 days. Evaluations
  showed 98% were satisfied with sessions. Thematic analysis of interviews with facilitators
  highlighted barriers to delivering an ACP community-based initiative, strategies
  used to build community buy-in and engagement, and ways success was measured. Conclusion(s):
  Patient navigators effectively engaged underserved and ethnically diverse rural
  populations in community-based settings. This model can be adapted to improve ACP
  in other underserved populations.'
