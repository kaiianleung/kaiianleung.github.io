abstract: Obesity and insulin resistance disproportionately impact Latino youth who
  experience one of the highest lifetime risks for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D).
  Few diabetes prevention programs have addressed \"upstream\" factors related to
  T2D, nor the specific culturally relevant lifestyle needs of overweight Latino youth.
  The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a culturally informed, community-based
  diabetes prevention program for overweight Latino adolescents on insulin sensitivity
  and glucose tolerance. Overweight Latino adolescents (n=18, BMI%=96.2+/-4.1, age
  15.2+/-1.0 yrs) were invited to participate in a 12-week lifestyle education program
  developed through a partnership between a community health clinic, an academic institution,
  and a local YMCA. Weekly group nutrition and lifestyle education classes were delivered
  to families by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 1-hr moderate to vigorous
  exercise sessions per week were held for youth. The program was designed to improve
  health by empowering youth and their families to make healthy lifestyle choices
  as well as empower community agencies to collaboratively facilitate these choices.
  A multi-sample 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with 30 minute sampling for insulin
  and glucose was used to assess T2D risk before and after the program. Fifteen youth
  (7 boys / 8 girls) completed the program and attended 91% of the education and physical
  activity sessions where mean heart rate was 146 +/- 21 BPM. Compared to baseline,
  insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) increased by 33.1% from 2.4 +/- 1.3 to 3.1 +/-
  1.4; p=0.01, 2-hour post-challenge glucose decreased by 9.2% from 117.2 +/- 4.8
  to 104.5 +/- 2.7 mg/dl; ptextless0.01, and 2-hr post-challenge insulin decreased
  by 37.6% from 161.2 +/- 21.3 to 88.8 +/- 16.7 muIU/ml; p=0.001. No significant changes
  were noted for fasting glucose or insulin. The improvements in insulin sensitivity
  and 2-hr glucose measures following the lifestyle intervention indicate a potential
  reduction in T2D risk among this high-risk population. Communitybased efforts are
  needed to close the diabetes-related health disparities gap and collaborative partnerships
  may prove most effective for reaching high-risk youth.
