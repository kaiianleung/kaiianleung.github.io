 abstract = {Obesity and insulin resistance disproportionately impact Latino youth who experience one of the highest lifetime risks for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Few diabetes prevention programs have addressed "upstream" factors related to T2D, nor the specific culturally relevant lifestyle needs of overweight Latino youth. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a culturally informed, community-based diabetes prevention program for overweight Latino adolescents on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Overweight Latino adolescents (n=18, BMI%=96.2+/-4.1, age 15.2+/-1.0 yrs) were invited to participate in a 12-week lifestyle education program developed through a partnership between a community health clinic, an academic institution, and a local YMCA. Weekly group nutrition and lifestyle education classes were delivered to families by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 1-hr moderate to vigorous exercise sessions per week were held for youth. The program was designed to improve health by empowering youth and their families to make healthy lifestyle choices as well as empower community agencies to collaboratively facilitate these choices. A multi-sample 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with 30 minute sampling for insulin and glucose was used to assess T2D risk before and after the program. Fifteen youth (7 boys / 8 girls) completed the program and attended 91% of the education and physical activity sessions where mean heart rate was 146 +/- 21 BPM. Compared to baseline, insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) increased by 33.1% from 2.4 +/- 1.3 to 3.1 +/- 1.4; p=0.01, 2-hour post-challenge glucose decreased by 9.2% from 117.2 +/- 4.8 to 104.5 +/- 2.7 mg/dl; p\textless0.01, and 2-hr post-challenge insulin decreased by 37.6% from 161.2 +/- 21.3 to 88.8 +/- 16.7 muIU/ml; p=0.001. No significant changes were noted for fasting glucose or insulin. The improvements in insulin sensitivity and 2-hr glucose measures following the lifestyle intervention indicate a potential reduction in T2D risk among this high-risk population. Communitybased efforts are needed to close the diabetes-related health disparities gap and collaborative partnerships may prove most effective for reaching high-risk youth.},
