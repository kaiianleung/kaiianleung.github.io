abstract: We explored the association between community racial/ethnic composition
  and obesity risk. In this cross-sectional study, we used nationally representative
  data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey linked to geographic data from the
  US Decennial Census and Census Business Pattern data. Living in communities with
  a high Hispanic concentration (textgreater= 25%) was associated with a 0.55 and
  0.42 increase in body mass index (BMI; defined as weight in kilograms divided by
  the square of height in meters) and 21% and 23% higher odds for obesity for Hispanics
  and non-Hispanic Whites, respectively. Living in a community with a high non-Hispanic
  Asian concentration (textgreater= 25%) was associated with a 0.68 decrease in BMI
  and 28% lower odds for obesity for non-Hispanic Whites. We controlled for individual-
  and community-level social, economic, and demographic variables. Community racial/ethnic
  composition is an important correlate of obesity risk, but the relationship differs
  greatly by individual race/ethnicity. To better understand the obesity epidemic
  and related racial/ethnic disparities, more must be learned about community-level
  risk factors, especially how built environment and social norms operate within communities
  and across racial/ethnic groups.
