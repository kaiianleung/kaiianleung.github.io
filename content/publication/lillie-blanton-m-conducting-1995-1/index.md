abstract: This article examines strategies and methodologic issues for researchers
  to consider when conducting community-based research within a racial/ethnic minority
  community. Members of minority communities have considerable skepticism about the
  health care system and researchers who work under its auspices. To facilitate quality
  research, it is necessary to build a mutually beneficial partnership between the
  community and researchers. Suggested strategies for accomplishing this goal, such
  as seeking out information on the social and political forces shaping the community
  and developing the community's capacity to undertake research of this type, are
  described. Methodologic issues include the importance of community input in defining
  the minority population group and its leadership, the benefits and limitations of
  conducting comparative analysis, and the need for measurement tools and techniques
  that are culturally and socially appropriate. Minority and nonminority researchers
  must make a concerted effort to gain knowledge of and respect for a community whose
  culture, values, and beliefs may differ from their own.
