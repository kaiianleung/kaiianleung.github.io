abstract: 'Objectives: Patient-provider communication is essential for patient-centered
  care, yet Asian American immigrant populations face barriers. We aim to describe:
  1) patient-reported communication-related characteristics for 16 disaggregated Asian
  American subgroups; and 2) the association of patient comprehension of provider
  communication with socio-demographics, language proficiency and concordance, and
  perceived cultural sensitivity in this population. Method(s): Descriptive statistics
  are presented for 1269 Asian American immigrants responding to cross-sectional,
  venue-sampled surveys conducted in New York City. Logistic regression models examine
  predictors of low comprehension of provider communication. Result(s): Approximately
  11% of respondents reported low comprehension of provider communication: lowest
  among South Asians and highest among Southeast Asians. Eighty-four percent were
  language-concordant with their provider, 90.1% agreed that their provider understood
  their background and values, and 16.5% felt their provider looked down on them.
  Low comprehension of provider communication was significantly associated with Southeast
  Asian subgroup, less education, limited English proficiency, public health insurance,
  patient-provider language discordance, and perceived low cultural understanding.
  Conclusion(s): Among our sample, language and cultural sensitivity are associated
  with comprehension of provider communication. Practice implications: Strategies
  improving language access and cultural sensitivity may be important for Asian immigrant
  patients. These could include interpretation services, bilingual community-based
  providers, and cultural sensitivity training.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.'
