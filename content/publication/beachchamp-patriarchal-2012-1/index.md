abstract: Intimate partner violence is a universal public health and public safety
  problem. Its disproportionate infliction on women may be influenced by patriarchal
  beliefs that dismiss violence against the female partner as a socially rationalized
  act. This is a secondary analysis of a domestic violence survey conducted in a Spanish-speaking
  community. The relationship between patriarchal beliefs and attitudes toward violence
  was examined. Agreement with the statement 'some women like to be hit' was equal
  for both men and women. This response was also associated with having known someone
  abused. Sharing a common language, culture, or heritage can also mean sharing common
  beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. A researcher, educator, or responder who is
  familiar with these matters can hold a deeper appreciation of a victim's community
  construct.
