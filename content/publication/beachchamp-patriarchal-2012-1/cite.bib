 abstract = {Intimate partner violence is a universal public health and public safety problem. Its disproportionate infliction on women may be influenced by patriarchal beliefs that dismiss violence against the female partner as a socially rationalized act. This is a secondary analysis of a domestic violence survey conducted in a Spanish-speaking community. The relationship between patriarchal beliefs and attitudes toward violence was examined. Agreement with the statement 'some women like to be hit' was equal for both men and women. This response was also associated with having known someone abused. Sharing a common language, culture, or heritage can also mean sharing common beliefs, attitudes, and experiences. A researcher, educator, or responder who is familiar with these matters can hold a deeper appreciation of a victim's community construct.},
