abstract: 'Purpose: To develop a reliable and valid questionnaire of bilingual language
  status with predictable relationships between self-reported and behavioral measures.
  Method: In Study 1, the internal validity of the Language Experience and Proficiency
  Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) was established on the basis of self-reported data from 52
  multilingual adult participants. In Study 2, criterion-based validity was established
  on the basis of standardized language tests and self-reported measures from 50 adult
  Spanishâ€“English bilinguals. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were established
  on healthy adults whose literacy levels were equivalent to that of someone with
  a high school education or higher. Results: Factor analyses revealed consistent
  factors across both studies and suggested that the LEAP-Q was internally valid.
  Multiple regression and correlation analyses established criterion-based validity
  and suggested that self-reports were reliable indicators of language performance.
  Self-reported reading proficiency was a more accurate predictor of first-language
  performance, and self-reported speaking proficiency was a more accurate predictor
  of second-language performance. Although global measures of self-reported proficiency
  were generally predictive of language ability, deriving a precise estimate of performance
  on a particular task required that specific aspects of language history be taken
  into account. Conclusion: The LEAP-Q is a valid, reliable, and efficient tool for
  assessing the language profiles of multilingual, neurologically intact adult populations
  in research settings.'
