abstract: "Community-engaged research needs involving community organisations as partners
  in research. Often, however, considerations regarding developing a meaningful partnership
  with community organisations are not highlighted. Researchers need to identify the
  most appropriate organisation with which to engage and their capacity to be involved.
  Researchers tend to involve organisations based on their connection to potential
  participants, which relationship often ends after achieving this objective. Further,
  the partner organisation may not have the capacity to contribute meaningfully to
  the research process. As such, it is the researchers' responsibility to build capacity
  within their partner organisations to encourage more sustainable and meaningful
  community-engaged research. Organisations pertinent to immigrant/ethnic-minority
  communities fall into three sectors: public, private and non-profit. While public
  and private sectors play an important role in addressing issues among immigrant/ethnic-minority
  communities, their contribution as research partners may be limited. Involving the
  non-profit sector, which tends to be more accessible and utilitarian and includes
  both grassroots associations (GAs) and immigrant service providing organisations
  (ISPOs), is more likely to result in mutually beneficial research partnerships and
  enhanced community engagement. GAs tend to be deeply rooted within, and thus are
  often truly representative of, the community. As they may not fully understand their
  importance from a researcher's perspective, nor have time for research, capacity-building
  activities are required to address these limitations. Additionally, ISPOs may have
  a different understanding of research and research priorities. Understanding the
  difference in perspectives and needs of these organisations, building trust and
  creating capacity building opportunities are important steps for researchers to
  consider towards building durable partnerships.Copyright Â©"
