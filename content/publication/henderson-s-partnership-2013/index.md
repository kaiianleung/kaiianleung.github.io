abstract: "Background: Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in
  Queensland, Australia, do not access health services, contributing to poor health
  outcomes. To improve health in CALD communities, a partnership was formed between
  the state government, two nongovernment CALDspecific organizations (NGOs), and a
  university to develop a service that could facilitate health service use. This qualitative
  research explored the partners' perspectives on how the partnership functioned and
  its outcomes. Objective(s): We sought to (1) explore how participants engaged with
  the principles of partnership, the processes they used, and their beliefs about
  the facilitators and barriers to intersectoral collaboration and (2) gain insights
  into how the partners perceived the development and functioning of the partnership.
  Method(s): Qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with each of the
  key stakeholders in the partnership (n = 4). A focus group was also conducted with
  those working within the two NGO partners in the delivery of the service (n = 8).
  Open-ended questions drawn from the literature on partnership principles were used
  to guide the interviews and focus group data collection. The data were transcribed
  and analyzed using thematic principles. Result(s): The four themes identified were:
  (1) Perceived benefits of the partnership outweighed organizational differences;
  (2) respectful relationships sustained the partnership; (3) mitigating conflict
  enabled the purpose of the partnership to be fulfilled; and (4) a neutral interpersonal
  space enabled the partnership to be enacted. Conclusion(s): Our study showed how
  contextual pressures created within the system can damage tenuous connections that
  have been developed between otherwise competitive organizations, leading to dissolution
  of partnerships. However, the study has also shown that partnerships may be purpose
  and time bound, not necessarily with respect to longevity. Through strategic negotiations,
  partnerships can be sustained until the goal of the partnership is attained, which
  in this instance was the development of a new service delivery model. Â© 2013 The
