abstract: Increasingly, health scientists are becoming aware that research collaborations
  that include community partnerships can be an effective way to broaden the scope
  and enhance the impact of research aimed at improving public health. Such collaborations
  extend the reach of academic scientists by integrating a variety of perspectives
  and thus strengthening the applicability of the research. Communication challenges
  can arise, however, when attempting to address specific research questions in these
  collaborations. In particular, inconsistencies can exist between scientists and
  community members in the use and interpretation of words and other language features,
  particularly when conducting research with a biomedical component. Additional challenges
  arise from differing perceptions of the investigative process. There may be divergent
  perceptions about how research questions should and can be answered, and in expectations
  about requirements of research institutions and research timelines. From these differences,
  misunderstandings can occur about how the results will ultimately impact the community.
  These communication issues are particularly challenging when scientists and community
  members are from different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds that may widen the
  gap between ways of talking and thinking about science, further complicating the
  interactions and exchanges that are essential for effective joint research efforts.
  Community-driven research that aims to describe the burden of disease associated
  with Helicobacter pylori infection is currently underway in northern Aboriginal
  communities located in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, with the goal
  of identifying effective public health strategies for reducing health risks from
  this infection. This research links community representatives, faculty from various
  disciplines at the University of Alberta, as well as territorial health care practitioners
  and officials. This highly collaborative work will be used to illustrate, from a
  researcher's perspective, some of the challenges of conducting public health research
  in teams comprising members with varying backgrounds. The consequences of these
  challenges will be outlined, and potential solutions will be offered.
