 abstract = {Introduction: Evidence based medicine (EBM) is increasingly embraced by complementary and alternative medicine. Academics from China, Australia and UK developed a Summer School EBM course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) students in China. Method(s): An action research approach was used to evaluate the effects of an international collaborative approach to improve learning and teaching. A systematic analysis of an EBM course conducted in 2015 with (66) students and (16) teacher/assistants was used to inform the 2016 course design. Before and after implementation of the 2016 course, (10) teacher/assistant and (20) student pre-/post-course survey responses were recorded to measure attitudes, knowledge and intention to apply EBM in TCM practice. Focus groups, teachers' diaries, field notes and survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Result(s): Changes made in the 2016 course include changing topic focus, catering for different language abilities and varying the learning format. Students and teachers found the course engaging and relevant. Chinese teachers adopted interactive teaching methods and believed they improved student engagement and learning. Teachers reported teaching EBM to TCM students in English was challenging but benefited from the experience. Students embraced the concepts of EBM and performed beyond their and their teachers' expectations. Conclusion(s): Cross-cultural collaboration in teaching a culturally challenging topic in a foreign language using unfamiliar teaching methods is demanding However, utilisation of an action research model can result in positive student evaluation and change in teacher beliefs and practice through sharing reflections and ideas.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH},
