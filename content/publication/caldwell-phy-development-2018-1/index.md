abstract: "Introduction: Evidence based medicine (EBM) is increasingly embraced by
  complementary and alternative medicine. Academics from China, Australia and UK developed
  a Summer School EBM course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) students in China.
  Method(s): An action research approach was used to evaluate the effects of an international
  collaborative approach to improve learning and teaching. A systematic analysis of
  an EBM course conducted in 2015 with (66) students and (16) teacher/assistants was
  used to inform the 2016 course design. Before and after implementation of the 2016
  course, (10) teacher/assistant and (20) student pre-/post-course survey responses
  were recorded to measure attitudes, knowledge and intention to apply EBM in TCM
  practice. Focus groups, teachers' diaries, field notes and survey data were analysed
  using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative
  data. Result(s): Changes made in the 2016 course include changing topic focus, catering
  for different language abilities and varying the learning format. Students and teachers
  found the course engaging and relevant. Chinese teachers adopted interactive teaching
  methods and believed they improved student engagement and learning. Teachers reported
  teaching EBM to TCM students in English was challenging but benefited from the experience.
  Students embraced the concepts of EBM and performed beyond their and their teachers'
  expectations. Conclusion(s): Cross-cultural collaboration in teaching a culturally
  challenging topic in a foreign language using unfamiliar teaching methods is demanding
  However, utilisation of an action research model can result in positive student
  evaluation and change in teacher beliefs and practice through sharing reflections
  and ideas.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH"
