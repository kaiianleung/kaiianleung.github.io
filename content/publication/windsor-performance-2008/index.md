abstract: The performance of 8- to 13-year-old monolingual English-speaking children
  with language impairment (LI) on seven nonlinguistic tasks was compared with two
  groups of typically developing children, monolingual English-speaking children,
  and proficient Spanish-English sequential bilingual children. Group differences
  were apparent, with a key finding that the LI group was observably slower than both
  typical groups in mental rotation and arithmetic, and also slower than the typical
  monolingual group in odd man out, pattern matching, and form completion. Overall,
  the response time (RT) increased equivalently across groups as task difficulty increased.
  Chronological age and perceptual-motor speed contributed to task performance, especially
  for the shorter tasks. RT trajectories across the 6-year age span showed that task
  RT decreased with age, but with greater variability for longer tasks that may also
  be more vulnerable to the effect of experience. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021
