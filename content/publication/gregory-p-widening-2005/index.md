abstract: "Objective: The project's objective was to provide a course in community
  and career development to enable women with a diversity of educational and ethnic
  backgrounds to move into appropriate employment or to enter mainstream education
  or training. Design(s): The course was developed using action research with continuous
  feedback from participants. Setting(s): The course took place in an ethnically mixed
  and disadvantaged inner city area. Method(s): Women were recruited by the course
  leaders via existing community networks. Both leaders had wide experience of working
  with women in the area where learning took place. The course was developed collaboratively
  with participants and course leaders. Result(s): Action research provided an appropriate
  framework for developing the course to meet the needs of participants. Half the
  participants achieved accreditation and half had gained related paid employment
  by the end of the course. Conclusion(s): Collaborative development resulted in a
  course that was more appropriate to participants' expressed needs and provided the
  foundation for future work with 'widening participation' students. The movement
  of women from ethnic minority communities into appropriate work is likely to have
  positive health impacts on the wider community."
