abstract: "BACKGROUND: Patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) have more difficulty
  communicating with health care providers and are less satisfied with their care
  than others. Both interpreter- and language-concordant clinicians may help overcome
  these problems but few studies have compared these approaches. OBJECTIVE(S): To
  compare self-reported communication and visit ratings for LEP Asian immigrants whose
  visits involve either a clinic interpreter or a clinician speaking their native
  language. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey-response rate 74%. PATIENTS: Two thousand
  seven hundred and fifteen LEP Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant adults who received
  care at 11 community-based health centers across the U.S. MEASUREMENTS: Five self-reported
  communication measures and overall rating of care. RESULT(S): Patients who used
  interpreters were more likely than language-concordant patients to report having
  questions about their care (30.1% vs 20.9%, Ptextless.001) or about mental health
  (25.3% vs 18.2%, P=.005) they wanted to ask but did not. They did not differ significantly
  in their response to 3 other communication measures or their likelihood of rating
  the health care received as \\\"excellent\\\" or \\\"Very good\\\" (51.7% vs 50.9%,
  P=.8). Patients who rated their interpreters highly (\\\"excellent\\\" or \\\"Very
  good\\\") were more likely to rate the health care they received highly (adjusted
  odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval, 2.3 to 10.1). CONCLUSION(S): Assessments
  of communication and health care quality for outpatient visits are similar for LEP
  Asian immigrants who use interpreters and those whose clinicians speak their language.
  However, interpreter use may compromise certain aspects of communication. The perceived
  quality of the interpreter is strongly associated with patients' assessments of
  quality of care overall."
