abstract: This study describes the health conditions of African refugees in Boise,
  Idaho obtained through self-report interviews and medical chart review. Comparisons
  between self-report data and data obtained through the medical chart review are
  described. This paper also describes the challenges and successes of collecting
  health data from African refugees in a health fair setting, the use of interpreters
  and DVDs with participants who speak seven different languages, and collaborative
  research with different African refugee groups utilizing community based participatory
  research. Findings include descriptive statistics related to the health conditions
  of the population. Comparison of the self-report and medical chart review indicated
  discrepancies in the areas of limitations to running and walking, high blood pressure,
  high cholesterol and in the need for exercise. Other issues emerged such as concern
  for safe administration of OTC medications due to parents' lack of knowledge of
  their children's weight.
