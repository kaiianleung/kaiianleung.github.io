 abstract = {Purpose of Study This project aims to provide a multilingual intimate partner violence (IPV) screening tool and a list of local, multilingual IPV counseling and shelter services for the API community of Seattle. Methods Used A literature review found a few key points. First, studies have shown that IPV programs such as hotlines and shelters are effective in reducing survivors' fear, increasing self-efficacy, coping skills and helping survivors feel more supported. Second, screening can improve quality of life for IPV survivors. Third, subjective screening questions like, "Do you feel safe at home?" are not sensitive, and survivors prefer self-administered or written methods rather than face to face questioning. The STaT screening tool was chosen for its 3 objective questions and up to 94.9% sensitivity. The card format was discussed with community partner API Chaya. The project was proposed to a behavioral health specialist, community health advocates, the Health Education Supervisor and Health Advocacy Manager at the International Community Health Services (ICHS) clinic in Seattle's International District. Summary of Results A two-part card was created with the STaT screening tool on the top card and a list of three multilingual, local IPV resources on the bottom card. The top can be torn off and disposed of after use, which, with the business card size, makes it discreet and less likely to be found by an abuser. The card will be translated to API languages and distributed at the ICHS clinic and by ICHS community health advocates when they host health fairs, dance classes, visit with community members etc. A document about how to use the card was also given to the clinic. Conclusions Collaboration between a community health clinic and a local IPV resource organization along with evidence based implementation strengthens the impact of this project. It provides IPV survivors with a screening tool that can be self-administered, and with acces to local, multilingual counseling and shelter services. The card will now be translated by the clinic, distributed in the International District of Seattle, and may soon be used by other ICHS clinics in different neighborhoods. This card is mainly targeted towards women because unfortunately there is a lack of research about and resources for IPV survivors who are men.},
