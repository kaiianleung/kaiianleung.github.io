abstract: 'Home-based self-sample human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may be an alternative
  for women who do not attend clinic-based cervical cancer screening. We assessed
  barriers to care and motivators to use at-home HPV self-sampling kits during the
  COVID-19 pandemic as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating kit effectiveness.
  Participants were women, aged 30-65 years and underscreened for cervical cancer
  in a safety-net healthcare system. We conducted telephone surveys in English/Spanish
  among a subgroup of trial participants, assessed differences between groups and
  determined statistical significance at p&lt;0.05. Over half of 233 survey participants
  reported clinic-based screening (Pap) is uncomfortable (67.8%), embarrassing (52.4%),
  and discomfort seeing male providers (63.1%). The latter two factors were significantly
  more prevalent among Spanish versus English speakers (66.4% vs 30% and 69.9 vs 52.2%,
  respectively, p&lt;0.01). Most women who completed the kit found Pap more embarrassing
  (69.3%), stressful (55.6%) and less convenient (55.6%) than the kit. The first factor
  was more prevalent among Spanish versus English speakers (79.6% vs 53.38%, p&lt;0.05).
  The COVID-19 pandemic influenced most (59.5%) to participate in the trial due to
  fear of COVID, difficulty making appointments and ease of using kits. HPV self-sampling
  kits may reduce barriers among underscreened women in a safety-net system.Competing
