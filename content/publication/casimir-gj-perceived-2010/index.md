abstract: There are few data on the relationships of anxiety and depression to insomnia
  among immigrants in the United States. Observations of high rates of symptoms of
  these associated conditions among older Russians indicate the need to focus clinical
  atention on this population. Relationships of self-reported depression and anxiety
  to insomnia complaints were investigated in a community-based sample of older Russian
  immigrants. Volunteers (N = 307) were urban community-residing Russians (ages 50
  to 95 years; 54% women). Surveys were conducted in a semistructured environment
  by bilingual educators in various community centers. 93% reported a major health
  problem, 83% experienced pain, and 62% had problems engaging in daily activities.
  Of the sample, 61% reported an insomnia complaint, and 43% considered depression
  and/or anxiety to be a major impairment. Logistic regression analysis showed that
  insomnia was the most important predictor of perceived anxiety and depression; the
  corresponding multivariate-adjusted odds ratio was 4.37. Insomnia complaints and
  perceptions of depression and anxiety among older Russians may have a synergistic
  effect. Both patients and primary-care physicians should be beter educated regarding
  the recognition of barriers limiting access to adequate health care among older
  Russians. Â© Psychological Reports 2010.
