abstract: 'BACKGROUND: There is little empirical evidence on the effects of social
  connectedness on geriatric depression for Southeast Asians. Studies have rarely
  examined interethnic differences in the resilience factors for depression in this
  diverse population. Greater understanding is needed as the number of older Southeast
  Asians in the United States increases., OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the association
  between social connectedness and depressive symptoms in Vietnamese, Laotian, and
  Cambodian elders., METHODS: Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
  approach, bilingual/bicultural staff collected demographics, the Lubben Social Network
  Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Univariate and multivariate regression
  models were constructed for the full aggregated sample and for each ethnic subgroup.,
  RESULTS: In the full aggregated sample analysis, Southeast Asian elders were at
  increased risk for depression and had low social connectedness. Marriage and English
  proficiency were resilience factors, whereas social connectedness did not play a
  significant role. In disaggregated analyses, high social connectedness, marriage,
  and younger age were resilience factors for Vietnamese elders. English proficiency
  was the only significant resilience factor for Laotians, and age at the time of
  immigration was the only significant resilience factor for Cambodian elders., CONCLUSIONS:
  This study underscores the need for researchers to disaggregate data for ethnic
  subgroups in the Asian American population. Southeast Asian elders are at increased
  risk for depression and have low social connectedness. There exist important interethnic
  differences in resilience factors for geriatric depression, suggesting the need
  for more studies and interventions that are sensitive to subtle cultural differences
  among Southeast Asian subgroups.'
