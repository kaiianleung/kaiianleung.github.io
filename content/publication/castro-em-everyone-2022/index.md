abstract: "Objectives: In recent years, increased anti-immigrant hostility has trickled
  into school settings creating toxic climates for immigrant-origin (I-O) students
  (Rogers, School and society in the age of trump, 2019,UCLA's Institute for Democracy,
  Education, and Access). Through youth participatory action research (yPAR), this
  study qualitatively examined how a class of Emerging Bilingual (EB) students aimed
  to promote more inclusive learning environments by designing, implementing, and
  evaluating a school-wide program. Here, we consider how the students experienced
  growth in their civic development as well as how they contended with resistances
  encountered during the project. Method(s): The current study took place at amajority
  I-O, northeastern high school and was led by an EB class (n = 20) and its teacher.
  Participants were as follows: on average 16.5 years; 60% female; and 65% Latinx,
  30%Black, and 5% mixed-race (Black-Latino).Multiple data sources documenting the
  students' experiences were collected (including weekly student reflections and ethnographic
  field notes) and then thematically analyzed using open coding. Result(s): Participating
  students demonstrated civic development as evidenced through: growing confidence
  that the program could generate positive change; enhanced sense of connection toward
  their classmates; and increased commitment to future civic engagement. Nonetheless,
  some participants demonstrated initial trepidation in both disclosing their migration
  stories as well as the potential efficacy of engaging in the project. Furthermore,
  otherswere disappointed by the disinterest displayed by some of their peers and
  teachers. Conclusion(s): Collaborative research can support I-O youths' civic development,
  though, the resistances encountered and engendered illuminate possible challenges
  to ensure its benefits.Copyright Â© 2021. American Psychological Association"
