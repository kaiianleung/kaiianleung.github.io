abstract: One factor that may influence how executive functions develop is exposure
  to more than one language in childhood. This study explored the impact of bilingualism
  on inhibitory control in autistic (n = 38) and non-autistic children (n = 51). Bilingualism
  was measured on a continuum of exposure to investigate the effects of language environment
  on two facets of inhibitory control. Behavioural control of motor impulses was modulated
  positively through increased bilingual exposure, irrespective of diagnostic status,
  but bilingual exposure did not significantly affect inhibition involving visual
  attention. The results partially support the hypothesis that bilingual exposure
  differentially affects components of inhibitory control and provides important evidence
  for families that bilingualism is not detrimental to their development. Copyright
