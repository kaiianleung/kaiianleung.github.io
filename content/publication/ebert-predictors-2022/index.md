abstract: Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) have impairments in
  their language-learning abilities that may influence interactions with environmental
  opportunities to learn two languages. This study explores relationships between
  proficiency in L1 and L2 and a set of environmental and personal variables within
  a group of school-age Spanish-English bilingual children with DLD and a group of
  typically-developing peers. Within each group, current usage in the home, length
  of L2 exposure, gender, maternal education, analytical reasoning, and number of
  L1 conversational partners were used to predict proficiency in each language. Results
  showed that home language environment, particularly home L2 usage, strongly predicted
  L1 proficiency but had less influence on the L2. Female gender predicted L1 skills
  in both groups, whereas analytical reasoning predicted both L1 and L2 but only for
  children with DLD. This study expands the limited literature on how children with
  DLD interact with their environment to learn two languages.
