abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the long term effects of CI on
  auditory, language, educational and social-emotional development of deaf children
  in different educational-communicative settings., METHODS: The outcomes of 58 children
  with profound hearing loss and normal non-verbal cognition, after 60 months of CI
  use have been analyzed. At testing the children were enrolled in three different
  educational settings; in mainstream education, where spoken language is used or
  in hard-of-hearing education where sign supported spoken language is used and in
  bilingual deaf education, with Sign Language of the Netherlands and Sign Supported
  Dutch. Children were assessed on auditory speech perception, receptive language,
  educational attainment and wellbeing., RESULTS: Auditory speech perception of children
  with CI in mainstream education enable them to acquire language and educational
  levels that are comparable to those of their normal hearing peers. Although the
  children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing settings show similar speech perception
  abilities, language development in children in hard-of-hearing settings lags significantly
  behind. Speech perception, language and educational attainments of children in deaf
  education remained extremely poor. Furthermore more children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing
  environments are resilient than in deaf educational settings. Regression analyses
  showed an important influence of educational setting., CONCLUSIONS: Children with
  CI who are placed in early intervention environments that facilitate auditory development
  are able to achieve good auditory speech perception, language and educational levels
  on the long term. Most parents of these children report no social-emotional concerns.
