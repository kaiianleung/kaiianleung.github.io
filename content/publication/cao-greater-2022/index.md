abstract: It has been documented that processing L2 and L1 engages a very similar
  brain network in bilingual adults. However, it is not known whether this similarity
  is evident in bilingual children as well or it develops with learning from children
  to adults. In the current study, we compared brain activation in Chinese-English
  bilingual children and adults during L1 and L2 processing. We found greater similarity
  between L1 and L2 in adults than in children, supporting the convergence hypothesis
  which argues that when the proficiency of L2 increases, the L2's brain network converges
  to the L1's brain network. We also found greater differences between adults and
  children in the brain for L2 processing than L1 processing, even though there were
  comparable increase in proficiency from children to adults in L1 and L2. It suggests
  an elongated developmental course for L2. This study provides important insights
  about developmental changes in the bilingual brain. Copyright Â© 2022 Cao, Fan, Yan,
