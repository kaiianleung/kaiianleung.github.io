abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of inferring the logical relationship,
  typically entailment or contradiction, between a premise and hypothesis. Code-mixing
  is the use of more than one language in the same conversation or utterance, and
  is prevalent in multilingual communities all over the world. In this paper, we present
  the first dataset for code-mixed NLI, in which both the premises and hypotheses
  are in code-mixed Hindi-English. We use data from Hindi movies (Bollywood) as premises,
  and crowd-source hypotheses from Hindi-English bilinguals. We conduct a pilot annotation
  study and describe the final annotation protocol based on observations from the
  pilot. Currently, the data collected consists of 400 premises in the form of code-mixed
  conversation snippets and 2240 code-mixed hypotheses. We conduct an extensive analysis
  to infer the linguistic phenomena commonly observed in the dataset obtained. We
  evaluate the dataset using a standard mBERT-based pipeline for NLI and report results.
