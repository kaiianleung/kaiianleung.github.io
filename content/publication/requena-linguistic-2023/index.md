abstract: This exploratory study addresses variation along the animacy scale in the
  bilingual first language acquisition of Spanish Differential Object Marking (DOM).
  Through the analysis of elicited narratives by child heritage speakers (HSs) and
  monolingual children, we report evidence that both groups distinguish between human
  and nonhuman animate direct objects (DOs) based on their DOM use. The results, albeit
  tentative given the data examined, suggest that variable contexts can offer new
  insight into the complex nature of HS grammars in order to test hypotheses of structural
  simplification.
