abstract: This study aimed to understand how positive youth development through sport
  and physical activity is understood and experienced by urban indigenous youth. Research
  in positive youth development claims that structured physical activities are critical
  for development. The 5 Cs (i.e., confidence, competence, character, connection,
  caring) are a gold standard when discussing positive outcomes and are important
  characteristics for youth to possess to attain the sixth C-contribution. Indigenous
  leaders recognize the value of sport for indigenous children and youth. Recent works
  in sport psychology have called for research to understand youth sport and physical
  activity from diverse cultural perspectives. The current study used a community-based
  participatory framework, and 43 youth from across 3 Canadian settings were recruited.
  Talking circles were used to collect the data. Results point to some unique understandings
  of the 5 Cs by the participants-namely, the inclusion of the self within each C.
