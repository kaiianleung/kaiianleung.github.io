 abstract = {This study aimed to understand how positive youth development through sport and physical activity is understood and experienced by urban indigenous youth. Research in positive youth development claims that structured physical activities are critical for development. The 5 Cs (i.e., confidence, competence, character, connection, caring) are a gold standard when discussing positive outcomes and are important characteristics for youth to possess to attain the sixth C-contribution. Indigenous leaders recognize the value of sport for indigenous children and youth. Recent works in sport psychology have called for research to understand youth sport and physical activity from diverse cultural perspectives. The current study used a community-based participatory framework, and 43 youth from across 3 Canadian settings were recruited. Talking circles were used to collect the data. Results point to some unique understandings of the 5 Cs by the participants-namely, the inclusion of the self within each C.},
