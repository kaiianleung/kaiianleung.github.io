abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The insights of Latinx/@ immigrants are essential to developing
  interventions that better address complex multilevel phenomena impacting mental
  health. Despite important advances in methods that genuinely embody participatory
  research practices, attention to collaborative data collection, analysis, and dissemination
  are limited. Our aim is to describe the development and implementation of research
  practices to address these gaps through an emphasis on and understanding of the
  centrality of language in collaborative research processes. METHOD(S): Guided from
  the outset by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic
  research partnership recognized the importance of developing and intentionally studying
  our collaborative processes. As part of an ethnographic interview study with 24
  Latinx/@ immigrants, a community-university research team developed innovative methods,
  including practices related to research team meetings, data collection, analysis,
  and dissemination, which we documented through ongoing discussion and reflection.
  RESULT(S): The resulting participatory research processes were grounded in a theoretical
  framework of praxis and language and included six innovative and iterative stages:
  (a) Establishing the research team, (b) planning the interview process/data collection,
  (c) developing the data analysis methodology, (d) interpreting findings to adapt
  the intervention, (e) integrating results of the participatory process into the
  analysis, and (f) data analysis for dissemination. CONCLUSION(S): A focus on praxis
  and language revealed how the language of research structures' power, meaning, feeling,
  collaboration, analysis, and transformation. We also found that bilingual participatory
  analytic processes have important implications with respect to achieving genuine
  inclusion in rigorous research that moves toward equity for Latinx/@ immigrants
  and other populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."
