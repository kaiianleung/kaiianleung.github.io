abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the significance and
  directions of the relationships among oral and manual fine motor skills and language
  abilities among Spanish-English bilingual children. If such relationships exist,
  this would support a shared biological influence on motor and language development.,
  METHOD: Participants included 56 bilingual children, 24 of whom met criteria for
  developmental language disorder (DLD), recruited based on teacher concern for language
  and/or reading comprehension abilities. Students participated in a battery of baseline
  tests to determine motor, language, and cognitive abilities. Correlations among
  all variables were examined for direction of relationships. Regression models explored
  the predictive power of motor skills with Spanish and English language ability as
  the outcome measure., RESULTS: Oral fine motor abilities (diadochokinetic rate productions
  of /pa/ and /pata/) predicted Spanish (but not English) oral language abilities
  in the expected direction (i.e., faster rates were associated with better language).
  Manual fine motor performance on computer tapping tasks was not related to performance
  in either language., CONCLUSIONS: Oral fine motor abilities are related to language
  abilities in bilingual children, but only for the native language. We did not find
  reliable differences in oral and manual fine motor skills between groups of bilingual
  children with and without DLD. These findings support a limited role of shared biological
  influences on motor and language development.'
