abstract: "A population survey of awareness and attitudes regarding a bone-marrow
  bank was carried out in 19 cities and towns of Shiga prefecture in July 1991, to
  identify factors that would promote donor self-registration among the general population.
  The survey involved 832 residents (416 men and 416 women) selected as follows: Each
  social welfare commissioner of the cities and towns selected a total of eight residents,
  one male and one female from each of 4 age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59
  years old). The questionnaires were distributed and collected by the social welfare
  commissioners with an overall response rate of 97.4%. Subjects answered questions
  regarding their experience and desire to participate in social volunteer activities,
  knowledge about bone-marrow banks, their perception of it's necessity, and whether
  they would participate in a bone-marrow bank, etc. A total of 25.9% of male and
  20.6% of female subjects stated they had a desire to register in a bone-marrow bank.
  From the result of multiple regression analysis, the characteristics of those who
  showed interest in registration in a bone-marrow bank included having heard of the
  bone-marrow bank, experience in social volunteer activity, experience in blood donation,
  knowledge of bone-marrow transplantation and living in a town where need for establishment
  of a bone-marrow bank was widely discussed among residents. In the promotion of
  the idea of a bone-marrow bank, the role of motivating people to participate in
  voluntary blood donation and other social volunteer activities appears to be important.(ABSTRACT
