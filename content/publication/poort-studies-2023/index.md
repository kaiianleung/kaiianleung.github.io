abstract: Poort, Warren and Rodd (2016) showed that bilinguals profit from recent
  experience with an identical cognate in their native language when they encounter
  the same word in their second language. We conducted two experiments employing the
  same cross-lingual long-term priming paradigm to determine whether this is also
  the case for non-identical cognates, as this would indicate they share an orthographic
  representation in the bilingual lexicon. In Experiment 1, Dutch–English bilinguals
  read Dutch sentences containing identical cognates (e.g. “winter”–“winter”), non-identical
  cognates (e.g. “baard”–“beard”) or the Dutch translations (e.g. “fiets”) of English
  control words (e.g. “bike”). These words were presented again in an English lexical
  decision task approximately 19 minutes later. The analysis revealed only weak evidence,
  based both on p-values and Bayes factors, for a small 6-9 ms facilitative priming
  effect. Experiment 2 aimed to determine whether including interlingual homographs
  (e.g. “angel”–“angel”) in the experiment modulates the size of the priming effect.
  This time, the analysis revealed no evidence for a priming effect, either based
  on p-values or Bayes factors, in either version of the experiment for either the
  cognates or the interlingual homographs. In line with previous findings (Poort &
  Rodd, 2017, May 9), we did find strong evidence for an interlingual homograph inhibition
  effect and no evidence for a cognate facilitation effect. We conclude that, since
  the cross-lingual long-term priming effect is largely semantic in nature, the lexical
  decision tasks we used were not sensitive enough to detect an effect of priming.
