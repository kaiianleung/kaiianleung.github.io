abstract: Reflexivity, an important component of qualitative inquiry generally, gains
  additional significance in community-based participatory research (CBPR). The varying
  partnerships among researchers, community partners, and community members are strengthened
  when a co â€“ learning, reflective model is applied. The use of reflective field notes
  can be a powerful tool to help achieve this end. In this article, we describe the
  dynamics of community-engaged research team where members applied a co-learning
  model to reflect upon their positionality in the community and in research. Using
  reflective field notes examined through a narrative approach to the PI's time in
  the field, we assess these positionalities through the relationships between CBPR
  work and power relations. The reflective practice embedded in the CBPR process brought
  these power relations to our attention. We then turned to the literature on power
  relations to better understand what was occurring in the study. The current case
  details the additional complexity that occurs when issues of language, translation,
  gender, and culture are introduced. Thus, this paper is a reflective analysis of
  a bilingual researcher's experience in the field specific to cross-cultural CBPR
  work.
