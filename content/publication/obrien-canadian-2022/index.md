abstract: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
  galvanized blood donor seroprevalence studies, which continue to inform public health
  policy. We propose that the two Canadian blood suppliers, Héma-Québec and Canadian
  Blood Services, expand their role in public health surveillance in the post-pandemic
  period. Together blood suppliers have near-national reach, collecting blood donations
  nearly every day in all larger cities and many smaller municipalities. Blood donors
  are a healthy subset of the general population. Demographic data, routine infectious
  disease testing and screening questionnaire data are collected for all donations.
  Close to one million blood samples per year could be made available for surveillance.
  With 90% repeat donors, longitudinal sampling is possible. Current blood donor surveillance
  includes monitoring infectious marker rates in low risk (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C virus)
  or asymptomatic (e.g. West Nile virus) populations, and ad hoc studies to monitor
  transfusion-transmissible infections. These include tick-borne infections such as
  Babesia microti and foodborne infections such as hepatitis E. Canadian Blood Services
  and Héma-Québec are actively seeking to engage with public health professionals
  to further develop a role in public health surveillance.
