abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The healthcare industry is currently experiencing a severe
  shortage of nurses and other allied healthcare professionals. To compound this crisis,
  the current workforce does not mirror the growing linguistic and cultural diversity
  of the population needing health care. This article describes a community partnership
  approach to creating educational and career opportunities in nursing and other health
  sciences for young, multicultural, bilingual teenagers. METHOD(S): Several community
  organizations joined together to design and implement an 8-week summer program entitled
  \"Start Out,\" which served to integrate life planning, mentorship, nursing assistant
  training, and college application assistance while providing summer salary stipends
  and work scholarship opportunities. Twenty-seven students participated in the program.
  RESULT(S): Twenty-four bilingual, economically disadvantaged teenagers 16 to 19
  years old, from the greater Seattle metropolitan area, completed the first session
  of this innovative program and passed the certified nursing assistant examination.
  CONCLUSION(S): Culturally focused assistance programs may provide an avenue to meet
  the current nursing shortage and provide healthcare workers who can be sensitive
  to the cultural and linguistic needs of the growing ethnic population.'
