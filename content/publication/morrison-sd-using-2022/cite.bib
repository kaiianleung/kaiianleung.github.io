 abstract = {Montagnards, an indigenous multitribal refugee-origin population concentrated in North Carolina, remain an invisible, medically underserved, and socioeconomically underrepresented Asian American sub-group. Yet this group is resilient, with language diversity, rich cultural traditions and family caregiving in multigenerational households. Using community-based participatory research methods, we developed and administered a two-part survey to 144 Montagnard adults, documenting socioeconomic characteristics, health indicators and lifestyle behaviors. Forty-one percent of participants had no formal education, 76% had little/no English proficiency and 28% described having a very hard time paying their bills. Seventy-seven percent were overweight per BMI category, 79% had elevated blood pressure and 100% scored high for significant depressive symptoms. Participants reported high levels of physical inactivity and daily dietary intake of MSG. However, Montagnards reported limited tobacco and alcohol use, a diet of fresh vegetables and rice, and regular church attendance. These represent protective lifestyle behaviors and targets for culturally responsive health interventions.Copyright © 2021.
