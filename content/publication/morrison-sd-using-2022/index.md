abstract: Montagnards, an indigenous multitribal refugee-origin population concentrated
  in North Carolina, remain an invisible, medically underserved, and socioeconomically
  underrepresented Asian American sub-group. Yet this group is resilient, with language
  diversity, rich cultural traditions and family caregiving in multigenerational households.
  Using community-based participatory research methods, we developed and administered
  a two-part survey to 144 Montagnard adults, documenting socioeconomic characteristics,
  health indicators and lifestyle behaviors. Forty-one percent of participants had
  no formal education, 76% had little/no English proficiency and 28% described having
  a very hard time paying their bills. Seventy-seven percent were overweight per BMI
  category, 79% had elevated blood pressure and 100% scored high for significant depressive
  symptoms. Participants reported high levels of physical inactivity and daily dietary
  intake of MSG. However, Montagnards reported limited tobacco and alcohol use, a
  diet of fresh vegetables and rice, and regular church attendance. These represent
  protective lifestyle behaviors and targets for culturally responsive health interventions.Copyright
