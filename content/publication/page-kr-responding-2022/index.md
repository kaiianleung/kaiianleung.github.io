abstract: Latinx immigrants have been profoundly impacted by COVID-19. As the Johns
  Hopkins Health System faced a surge in admissions of limited English proficiency
  patients with COVID-19, it became evident that an institutional strategy to address
  the needs of this patient population was needed. The Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM)
  Latinx Anchor Strategy was established in April 2020 with diverse stakeholder engagement
  to identify the most urgent community needs and develop timely solutions. The JHM
  Latinx Anchor Strategy provided a platform for information sharing to promote equitable
  access to resources for Latinxs with limited English proficiency who were impacted
  by COVID-19. Leveraging institutional, community, and government resources and expertise,
  the JHM Latinx Anchor Strategy helped establish interventions to improve access
  to COVID-19 testing and care for low-income immigrants without a primary care doctor
  and helped mitigate economic vulnerability through the distribution of food for
  2,677 individuals and cash to 446 families and 95 individuals (May to August 2020).
  Expanded linguistic and culturally competent communication through webinars and
  livestream events reached more than 10,000 community members and partners. Over
  7,500 limited English proficiency patients received linguistically congruent direct
  patient services through the Esperanza Center bilingual hotline, community testing
  resulting efforts, and inpatient consultations. The first stage of the JHM Latinx
  Anchor Strategy relied heavily on volunteer efforts. Funding for a sustainable response
  will be required to address ongoing COVID-19 needs, including expansion of the bilingual/bicultural
  healthcare workforce, expanded access to primary care, and investments in population
  health strategies addressing social determinants of health.
