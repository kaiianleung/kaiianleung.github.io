abstract: Understanding and respecting different linguistic and socio-cultural needs
  of health service users is critical to design, adapt and provide appropriate health
  services. We explored access to male family planning methods in The Democratic Republic
  of Timor-Leste, a linguistically and culturally diverse nation, by conducting 14
  participatory group discussions (PGDs) with 175 participants across seven municipalities.
  Participants (84 men and 91 women, aged 18 to 72) spoke 13 different languages.
  PGDs were audio-recorded and translated to English using a multilingual panel translation
  approach that enabled rigorous and reflexive discussion and learning between researchers
  about context and meaning. Planning for language diversity helped us to centre participant
  voices and to hear perspectives that may have otherwise been excluded or misrepresented.
  Our study affirms the need for research teams to include diverse members who help
  ensure meaning and voice is not lost across cultural and linguistic differences.
  Linguistic respect, inclusion and transparency are required to realise improved
  health and development outcomes.
