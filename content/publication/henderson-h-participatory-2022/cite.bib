 abstract = {Understanding and respecting different linguistic and socio-cultural needs of health service users is critical to design, adapt and provide appropriate health services. We explored access to male family planning methods in The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, a linguistically and culturally diverse nation, by conducting 14 participatory group discussions (PGDs) with 175 participants across seven municipalities. Participants (84 men and 91 women, aged 18 to 72) spoke 13 different languages. PGDs were audio-recorded and translated to English using a multilingual panel translation approach that enabled rigorous and reflexive discussion and learning between researchers about context and meaning. Planning for language diversity helped us to centre participant voices and to hear perspectives that may have otherwise been excluded or misrepresented. Our study affirms the need for research teams to include diverse members who help ensure meaning and voice is not lost across cultural and linguistic differences. Linguistic respect, inclusion and transparency are required to realise improved health and development outcomes.},
