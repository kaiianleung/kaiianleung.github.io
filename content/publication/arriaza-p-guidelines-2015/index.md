abstract: The purpose of this article is to synthesize and chronicle the authors'
  experiences as four bilingual and bicultural researchers, each experienced in conducting
  cross-cultural/cross-language qualitative research. Through narrative descriptions
  of experiences with Latinos, Iranians, and Hmong refugees, the authors discuss their
  rewards, challenges, and methods of enhancing rigor, trustworthiness, and transparency
  when conducting cross-cultural/cross-language research. The authors discuss and
  explore how to effectively manage cross-cultural qualitative data, how to effectively
  use interpreters and translators, how to identify best methods of transcribing data,
  and the role of creating strong community relationships. The authors provide guidelines
  for health care professionals to consider when engaging in cross-cultural qualitative
  research.
