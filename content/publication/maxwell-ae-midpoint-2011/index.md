abstract: 'Background: Racial/ethnic minority groups have higher risks for disease
  resulting from obesity.Community Context: The University of California, Los Angeles,
  and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health partnered with community
  organizations to disseminate culturally targeted physical activity and nutrition-based
  interventions in worksites.Methods: We conducted community dialogues with people
  from 59 government and nonprofit health and social service agencies to develop wellness
  strategies for implementation in worksites. Strategies included structured group
  exercise breaks and serving healthy refreshments at organizational functions. During
  the first 2 years, we subcontracted with 6 community-based organizations (primary
  partners) who disseminated these wellness strategies to 29 organizations within
  their own professional networks (secondary worksites) through peer modeling and
  social support. We analyzed data from the first 2 years of the project to evaluate
  our dissemination approach.Outcome: Primary partners had difficulty recruiting organizations
  in their professional network as secondary partners to adopt wellness strategies.
  Within their own organizations, primary partners reported significant increases
  in implementation in 2 of the 6 core organizational strategies for promoting physical
  activity and healthy eating. Twelve secondary worksites that completed organizational
  assessments on 2 occasions reported significant increases in implementation in 4
  of the 6 core organizational strategies.Interpretation: Dissemination of organizational
  wellness strategies by trained community organizations through their existing networks
  (train-the-trainer) was only marginally successful. Therefore, we discontinued this
  dissemination approach and focused on recruiting leaders of organizational networks.'
