abstract: LA VIDA--the Southwest Detroit Partnership to Prevent Intimate Violence
  Against Latina Women--evolved in response to community concern about the problem
  of intimate partner violence (IPV) and the lack of culturally competent preventive
  and support services for Latino women and men in southwest Detroit. Since 1997,
  diverse organizations have mobilized as a community-academic partnership to ensure
  the availability, accessibility, and utilization of IPV services. This article describes
  and analyzes the evolution of LA VIDA within a community-based participatory research
  framework using a case study approach that draws on multiple data sources including
  group and individual interviews and field notes. The challenges and lessons learned
  in addressing a complex multifaceted problem such as IPV in an ethnic minority community
  are highlighted in an examination of the process of mobilizing diverse organizations,
  conducting community diagnosis and needs assessment activities, establishing goals
  and objectives within a social ecological framework, and integrating evaluation
  during the development phase.
