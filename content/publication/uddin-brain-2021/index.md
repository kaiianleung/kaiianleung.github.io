abstract: Cognitive flexibility enables appropriate responses to a changing environment
  and is associated with positive life outcomes. Adolescence, with its increased focus
  on transitioning to independent living, presents particular challenges for youths
  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often struggle to behave in a flexible way
  when faced with challenges. This review focuses on brain mechanisms underlying the
  development of flexible cognition during adolescence and how these neural systems
  are affected in ASD. Neuroimaging studies of task switching and set-shifting provide
  evidence for atypical lateral frontoparietal and midcingulo-insular network activation
  during cognitive flexibility task performance in individuals with ASD. Recent work
  also examines how intrinsic brain network dynamics support flexible cognition. These
  dynamic functional connectivity studies provide evidence for alterations in the
  number of transitions between brain states, as well as hypervariability of functional
  connections in adolescents with ASD. Future directions for the field include addressing
  issues related to measurement of cognitive flexibility using a combination of metrics
  with ecological and construct validity. Heterogeneity of executive function ability
  in ASD must also be parsed to determine which individuals will benefit most from
  targeted training to improve flexibility. The influence of pubertal hormones on
  brain network development and cognitive maturation in adolescents with ASD is another
  area requiring further exploration. Finally, the intriguing possibility that bilingualism
  might be associated with preserved cognitive flexibility in ASD should be further
  examined. Addressing these open questions will be critical for future translational
  neuroscience investigations of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in adolescents
  with ASD. Copyright Â© 2020 Society of Biological Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier
