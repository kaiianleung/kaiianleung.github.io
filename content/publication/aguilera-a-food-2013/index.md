abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between food insecurity
  and food patterns among Mexican-heritage children, ages 2-8 yrs., in Fresno County,
  California. The community-based sample was recruited from a predominantly agricultural
  worker population in a small Central Valley town as part of a five-year childhood
  obesity prevention study (Ninos Sanos, Familia Sana, Healthy Children, Healthy Family).
  Only baseline data from the first year are reported here. Using a 30-item food frequency
  questionnaire, bilingual researchers interviewed parents (n=61) about their child's
  diet and feeding practices during the past month (between July to Oct. 2012). Food
  security data during the previous 3 months were collected using the 18-item Food
  Security Survey. Over the summer months, prevalence of low food security and very
  low food security was 41% and 13%, respectively. Among the children, the most frequently
  consumed foods (% of parents reporting consumption textgreater= 1 time/day) included
  fresh fruit (76%); low-fat milk (70%); corn tortillas (48.6%); and instant cereal
  (31%). Among less nutrient dense foods, frequency of consumption (% textgreater=
  1 time/day) was 12.5% for soda; 20.5% for fruit drinks; 16% for cookies; and 8%
  for chips. Even during the summer months when many parents are employed, food insecurity
  is relatively high.
