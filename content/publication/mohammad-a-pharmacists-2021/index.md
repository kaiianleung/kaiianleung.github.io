abstract: Background There has been no in depth published study to date reporting
  on community pharmacists' current experiences and their future practice needs relating
  to providing culturally competent pharmaceutical care to Australian culturally and
  linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency. Objective To explore
  community pharmacists' experiences serving culturally and linguistically diverse
  patients who have low English proficiency. Setting Community pharmacists in Australia.
  Method Focus group discussions with practising community pharmacists were conducted.
  Participants were recruited from metropolitan Sydney. Discussion centred around
  their current experiences and practice changes needed to enhance the provision of
  culturally competent pharmaceutical care. Thematic analysis using the constant comparison
  method within a grounded theory approach was performed on the data collected. Main
  outcome measure Participants' experiences in providing culturally competent care
  to culturally and linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency.
  Results Thirty community pharmacists participated in six focus group discussions.
  Inadequate provision of culturally competent care was found to be primarily due
  to the issue of language incongruence between pharmacist and patient. Participants
  proposed various means with which such care may be provided to ensure patient safety.
  Conclusion Pharmacist participants expressed being inadequately equipped to provide
  culturally competent care in the community setting and identified potential means
  by which such care may be delivered. Addressing identified barriers that hinder
  community pharmacists' capacity to engage in culturally competent practice can potentially
  improve provision of pharmaceutical care to culturally and linguistically diverse
  patients with low English proficiency.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive
