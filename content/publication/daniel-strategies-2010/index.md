abstract: Hispanics are the largest minority group in United States and at a great
  risk for poor health outcomes linked to poor access to health care. Their large
  geographic distribution makes it critical that the underlying factors resulting
  in health care disparities among documented and undocumented Hispanics be addressed
  at local, state, and national levels. Health care systems should establish community
  partnership for effective strategies to address these disparities. This article
  presents factors identified in the literature that contribute to health care disparities
  among Hispanics and provides strategies for improving access to health care for
  health promotion.
