 abstract = {Purpose: High rates of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exist in foreign- born (FB) persons who are often not diagnosed. We implemented a HBV screening and care linkage program targeting Asian communities in New Jersey from 2014-16. Method(s): We conducted this program as a primary care practice based out of a community hospital and collaborated with local ethnic community and faith-based organizations. Screening occurred at an Asian-targeted primary care site, outreach events, and via a coupon for free testing at outpatient labs. Persons were tested for HBsAg, HBcAb and HBsAb. A patient navigator assisted with linking hepatitis B-infected persons to care. Result(s): Of 692 persons tested, 80% were Asian. Median age was 55, and 64% were female. Fifty-nine percent were screened through outreach events, 30% through primary care, and 11% through coupons. Five percent (36) were HBsAg positive, and country-of-origin stratification showed highest rates in China (11.1%) and Taiwan (7.7%). One-third of participants were HBV-susceptible, and vaccines were recommended. Fifty-six percent were immune, and immunity was due to previous exposure in 33% of FB versus 10% in US born (p\textless.001). Fourteen percent reported having no insurance. Of the insured, 69% reported having a primary care physician, and 36% of these reported having prior HBV testing. In the risk factor survey, 31% reported acupuncture, 34% body piercing, 32% medical procedure abroad, and 10% household member with CHB. Of Asians, 19% reported a family member with CHB. HBV knowledge survey revealed many gaps; only 52% were aware that HBV causes cancer and more than 20% believed that HBV is transmitted through food or sharing food. Among 36 patients with CHB, 86% were linked-to-care to the practice. Ninety-one percent received HBV care, an evaluation by an internist trained in HBV management. HBV testing included HBV DNA (97%), liver function tests (97%), and HBeAg/HBeAb (93%). Nineteen percent required antiviral treatment. Household contact testing was advised for all, and 50% (18) had a family member return, with 5 of those receiving vaccine. Insurance enrollment efforts reduced the number uninsured CHB patients from 13 to 3. Four patients obtained care in Taiwan or China. Conclusion(s): Collaborations of providers and community organi zations can be effective at screening hard-to-reach foreign-born populations who face lack of insurance, gaps in knowledge, and lack of PCP screening. We found high rates of previous HBV exposure in FB persons and counselled on potential HBV reactivation. Navigation services based out of a primary care office were successful at achieving high rates of follow-up and HBV-directed care.},
