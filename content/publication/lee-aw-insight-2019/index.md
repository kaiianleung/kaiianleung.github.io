abstract: "Objectives The aims of our study were to describe current hepatitis B prevalence
  among Vietnamese Americans and to examine predictors of hepatitis B risk in this
  specific ethnic community. Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from a community-based
  screening program. Setting This analysis was based on hepatitis screening community
  events in Southern California. Participants 2508 Vietnamese Americans in Southern
  California. Outcome measures Serological tests for hepatitis B surface antigen,
  hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody were used to classify
  participants as one of four hepatitis B infection statuses: currently infected,
  previously infected, susceptible, or immune due to a previous hepatitis B vaccination.
  Results Across 2508 participants, 9.0% were currently infected with hepatitis B
  and 17.7% were at risk for hepatitis B. Females and those reporting a previous hepatitis
  B vaccination were at significant decreased risk of hepatitis B (OR=0.48, 95% CI
  0.33 to 0.69 and OR=0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93, respectively) whereas those born
  outside of the USA and with a family history of the disease showed substantial increased
  risk (OR=13.36, 95% CI 1.62 to 110.05 and OR=4.68, 95% CI 2.66 to 8.22, respectively).
  Among those who reported a previous hepatitis B vaccination, less than half (42.9%)
  possessed the protective antibodies that result from a hepatitis B vaccination.
  Conclusions Vietnamese Americans remain disproportionately burdened by hepatitis
  B. Public health efforts that focus on improving hepatitis B awareness and vaccination
  knowledge and that are tailored to specific high-risk subgroups, such as immigrants
  and those with infected family members, could help in addressing the disease's burden
  in this high-prevalence population.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s))
