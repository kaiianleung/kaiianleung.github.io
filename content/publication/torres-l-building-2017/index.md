abstract: This article discusses the challenges and rewards, as well as the affective
  labor, involved in forging a Latina lesbian \"translengua,\" in other words a common
  language in the context of Latina lesbian organizing. I explore how members of Latina
  Lesbians en Nuestro Ambiente (LLENA) and Amigas Latinas, Chicago-based Latina lesbian
  organizations, attempted to foster consensus for collective action in the face of
  language differences and preferences. Through analysis of archives and interviews
  with activists, I untangle how LLENA and Amigas Latinas negotiated deeply personal
  and sensitive issues around language use as they worked to build an inclusive movement.
  I also identify strategies used to enact a translengua that could bridge linguistic
  differences within the Latina lesbian community.
