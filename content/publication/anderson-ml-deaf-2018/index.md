abstract: One of the most understudied health disparity populations in the United
  States is the Deaf community-a sociolinguistic minority group of at least 500,000
  individuals who communicate using American Sign Language. Research within this population
  is lacking, in part, due to researchers' use of methodologies that are inaccessible
  to Deaf sign language users. Traditional qualitative methods were developed to collect
  and analyze participants' spoken language. There is, therefore, a paradigm shift
  that must occur to move from an auditory data schema to one that prioritizes the
  collection and analysis of visual data. To effectively navigate this shift when
  working with Deaf sign language users, there are unique linguistic and sociopolitical
  considerations that should be taken into account. The current article explores these
  considerations and outlines an emerging method of conducting qualitative analysis
  that, we argue, has the potential to enhance qualitative researchers' work regardless
  of the population of focus.
