abstract: Bilinguals, in their foreign language, are spared from common decision-making
  biases. Typically, this “Foreign Language Effect” results in increased accuracy.
  We examined the Foreign Language Effect in the context of logical reasoning, in
  which reasoners are required to track the logical status of a syllogism, ignoring
  its believability. Across three experiments, we found the reverse Foreign Language
  Effect; foreign language reasoners are less able to evaluate the logical structure
  of syllogisms, but no less biased by their believability. One path to succeeding
  in reasoning tasks is always engaging in reflective processing. A more efficient
  strategy is metacognitively tracking whether belief-based intuitions conflict with
  logic-based intuitions and only reflecting when such conflict is present. We provide
  evidence that foreign language reasoners are less accurate because they struggle
  to detect belief-logic conflict, and in turn fail to engage in reflective processing
  when necessary to override the incorrect, intuitive response. We propose that foreign
  language reasoners are less able to detect belief-logic conflict either due to weakened
  intuitions or due to a more conservative threshold for the detection of conflict
  between multiple competing intuitions. Data for the experiments can be accessed
