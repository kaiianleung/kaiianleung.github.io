 abstract = {There is a growing demand for utilizing evidence-based approaches to increase physical activity. While systematic reviews have recommended strategies, researchers have cautioned that these strategies must be adapted to fit the needs of specific populations and the community context. The purpose of our work was to use a community-based participatory research approach to identify issues to consider when adapting evidence-based physical activity interventions with and within racial/ethnic minority communities. Concept mapping was used to enable members of racial/ethnic minority communities who were engaged in prevention research to identify issues to consider when adapting physical activity recommendations for use with and within racial and ethnic minority communities. Concept mapping resulted in ten issues to consider when adapting physical activity interventions. Areas of similarity and difference in how these issues were ranked among racial/ethnic groups were reviewed. The issues to consider when adapting evidence-based physical activity interventions with and within racial/ethnic minority communities were similar to those discussed in previous literature; however, the operationalization of many of these issues was seen as unique.},
