abstract: 'Objective: Sex differences following concussion are poorly understood.
  The purpose of this study was to examine whether male and female adolescent athletes
  with prior concussions differ regarding neurocognitive function and symptom reporting.
  Setting(s): Community-based hockey teams. Participant(s): Participants included
  615 elite hockey players 13 to 17 years old (mean = 15.5, 95% confidence interval
  [CI] = 15.4-15.6). There were 517 males and 98 females. Players with English as
  a second language, attention or learning problems, a concussion within 6 months
  of baseline, or suspected invalid test profiles were excluded from these analyses.
  Design(s): Cross-sectional. MAIN MEASURE: Domain scores and symptom ratings from
  the ImPACT computerized battery. Result(s): There were no significant neurocognitive
  differences between males and females with (F5,227 = 1.40, P =.227) or without (F5,376
  = 1.33, P = 0.252) a prior history of concussion. Male and female athletes with
  a history of concussion reported higher raw symptom scores than those without a
  prior concussion; however, sex differences disappear when symptom scores are adjusted
  for known sex differences in controls (total score, F2,230 = 0.77, P =.46; Cohen
  d = 0.01 or domain scores (F4,227 = 1.52, P =.197; Cohen d = 0.07-0.18). Conclusion(s):
  Although those with prior concussions report more symptoms (but do not differ on
  neurocognition), this study does not support sex differences with cognition or symptoms
  in adolescent athletes with prior concussions. Â© 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott
