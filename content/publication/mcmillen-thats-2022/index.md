abstract: Research has investigated how lexical-semantic and participant factors impact
  word learning in young children and adults. However, limited information pertaining
  to expressive vocabulary development exists for school-aged bilinguals-particularly
  those with developmental language disorder (DLD). Cross-linguistic differences in
  the semantic characteristics of words may impact the types of cues available for
  constructing expressive vocabulary knowledge. To address this gap, we evaluated
  the relationships between intrinsic factors (age, language ability), extrinsic factors
  (L1 exposure), and word characteristics (e.g. imageability, concreteness) with item
  difficulty and expressive vocabulary knowledge in school-aged Spanish-English bilinguals
  with and without DLD. While we found similar patterns of associations between item
  difficulty and word characteristics across language ability groups, divergent predictive
  patterns emerged across languages and across ability groups. Educators supporting
  the development of bilingual students' expressive vocabulary knowledge must account
  for not only cultural differences across students, but also characteristics inherent
  to words. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
