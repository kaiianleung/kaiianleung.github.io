 abstract = {Bilinguals often codeswitch between languages mid-sentence. Do incongruent codeswitches, which follow the word order of only one language, occur? If so, how do bilinguals comprehend them, given the clash in grammaticality? First, we demonstrated that incongruent codeswitches occur, based on a corpus analysis of Spanish-English speech. Then, we measured bilinguals’ assessments of congruent codeswitches (Experiment 1) and incongruent codeswitches (Experiment 2) using an offline rating task. This task was sensitive to codeswitching costs and grammaticality. More importantly, the ratings for incongruent codeswitches supported the Current Word hypothesis, which predicts that codeswitches follow the word order of the language of the current word, but not the Matrix Language hypothesis (Myers-Scotton, 2002). These results can be understood within a bilingual comprehension theory in which activation spreads from words in the input to language-independent grammatical structures, leading bilinguals to make language-independent predictions about the syntactic category of upcoming words.},
