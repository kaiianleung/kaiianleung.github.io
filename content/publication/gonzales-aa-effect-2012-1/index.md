abstract: American Indians have one of the lowest colorectal cancer (CRC) screening
  rates for any racial/ethnic group in the U.S., yet reasons for their low screening
  participation are poorly understood. We examine whether tribal language use is associated
  with knowledge and use of CRC screening in a community-based sample of American
  Indians. Using logistic regression to estimate the association between tribal language
  use and CRC test knowledge and receipt we found participants speaking primarily
  English were no more aware of CRC screening tests than those speaking primarily
  a tribal language (OR = 1.16 [0.29, 4.63]). Participants who spoke only a tribal
  language at home (OR = 1.09 [0.30, 4.00]) and those who spoke both a tribal language
  and English (OR = 1.74 [0.62, 4.88]) also showed comparable odds of receipt of CRC
  screening. Study findings failed to support the concept that use of a tribal language
  is a barrier to CRC screening among American Indians.
