abstract: 'Background: Culturally-appropriate family models of diabetes self-management
  education and support (DSMES) using community health workers (CHWs) have been shown
  to help address barriers to improving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) self-management
  for racial/ethnic minority communities; however, there is limited DSMES research
  among Marshallese and other Pacific Islanders. Using a community-based participatory
  research approach, we engaged community stakeholders to co-design a study to implement
  a culturally adapted family model DSMES (F-DSMES) intervention in faith-based organizations
  (FBOs) (i.e., churches). Method(s): Using a cluster-randomized controlled trial
  design, we will assess the effectiveness of the F-DSMES intervention for Marshallese
  patients with T2DM in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Twenty-four FBOs (with 12 primary participants
  per FBO) will be randomized to one of two study arms: the intervention arm or the
  wait-list control arm. Primary participants must have at least one family member
  willing to attend education sessions and data collection events. The F-DSMES intervention
  consists of ten h of diabetes education delivered by CHWs over eight to ten weeks.
  Data will be collected from the intervention arm at pre-intervention (baseline),
  immediate post-intervention (12 weeks), and three months post-intervention. The
  wait-list control arm will complete a second pre-intervention data collection before
  receiving the intervention. The primary study outcome will be glycemic control,
  as measured by HbA1c. Secondary measures include glucose, weight, body mass index,
  blood pressure, diabetes self-management behaviors, and diabetes management self-efficacy.
  Conclusion(s): The knowledge gained from this research will inform future DSMES
  and other health promotion interventions conducted with Marshallese and other Pacific
  Islander communities.Copyright Â© 2022'
