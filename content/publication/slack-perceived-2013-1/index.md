abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to explore the perceived impact of an interprofessional
  education (IPE) program for health sciences students on two culturally diverse,
  underserved communities. A community resilience/capacity framework, consisting of
  catalysts (primarily the creation of awareness) and capital components: human (workforce
  development), social (networking and empowerment) and economic (volunteer labor
  and money spent by the program), provided the conceptual underpinnings for the study.
  Focus groups with stakeholders in two communities, one rural and one metropolitan,
  were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed by categorizing data according to
  each capital component. In addition to the concepts contained in the capacity framework
  a new category, informational capital (data specific to the community) emerged during
  the analysis. We suggest that by acting as a catalyst a community based interprofessional
  program can affect components of community resilience/capacity, primarily human,
  social, and informational capital. Using the community resilience/capacity framework
  facilitated exploration of the perceived impact of an educational program on one
  rural and one urban underserved community beyond assessing student outcomes or number
  of clients served.'
