abstract: Recent work within the language sciences, particularly bilingualism, has
  sought new methods to evaluate and characterize how people differentially use language
  across different communicative contexts. These differences have thus far been linked
  to changes in cognitive control strategy, reading behavior, and brain organization.
  Here, we approach this issue using a novel application of Network Science to map
  the conversational topics that Montréal bilinguals discuss across communicative
  contexts (e.g., work, home, family, school, social), in their dominant vs. non-dominant
  language. Our results demonstrate that all communicative contexts display a unique
  pattern in which conversational topics are discussed, but only a few communicative
  contexts (work and social) display a unique pattern of how many languages are used
  to discuss particular topics. We also demonstrate that the dominant language has
  greater network size, strength, and density than the non-dominant language, suggesting
  that more topics are used in a wider variety of contexts in this language. Lastly,
  using community detection to thematically group the topics in each language, we
  find evidence of greater specificity in the non-dominant language than the dominant
  language. We contend that Network Science is a valuable tool for representing complex
  information, such as individual differences in bilingual language use, in a rich
  and granular manner, that may be used to better understand brain and behavior.
