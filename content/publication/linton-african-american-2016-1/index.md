abstract: Downloadable! African-Americans and Latinos make up about 60% of Chicago's
  population. This research looks at how these groups view local TV news coverage
  of their communities. A random telephone survey of 340 blacks and bilingual Latinos
  reveals that only 35% think their race or ethnic group is accurately portrayed on
  local TV news. They rate local news as \"good\" in general, but say it does only
  a \"fair\" job of covering their ethnic community. The most common complaint, brought
  up by more than half the blacks and nearly one-third of the Latinos is that TV news
  focuses on the bad things in their community and rarely reports the good. African-Americans
  are three times more likely than Latinos to say local TV news hurts race relations
  in the city, though the largest number said it makes no difference. The two groups
  watch about the same amount of local TV news, averaging 5.6 days a week. African-Americans
  are significantly more likely than Latinos to have a favorite anchor and show a
  strong preference for black anchors. While 80% of the Latinos surveyed also watch
  Spanish-language local TV news, they watch it less often than English-language stations.
