abstract: 'Intro: Uptake of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RATs) for self-testing
  has been high following authorisation by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration
  (TGA). However, there are no published Australian data assessing feasibility and
  compliance with home-based rapid antigen testing. The aim of this study was to determine
  the acceptability of daily rapid antigen self-testing. Method(s): We prospectively
  recruited a cohort of hospital employees and students from primary and secondary
  school to perform daily self-testing using RATs in the home over 14 consecutive
  days. Participants consenting to the study were supplied with 15 Roche SARS-CoV-2
  Antigen Nasal Self Tests, 3 saliva swabs for self-collection for RT-PCR and were
  asked to record results and answer a daily survey using a smartphone application.
  Finding(s): 38% (26/68) of the cohort were compliant to 14 consecutive days of testing;
  this was significantly higher in students (71%) than hospital employees (28%). The
  median number of tests performed over 14 consecutive days was 11 and time to first
  missed test was a median 5.5 days. The most common reasons for missing days were
  \"I forgot\" (37.5%) and \"too busy\" (8.9%). Ease of self- nasal swabbing, self-nasal
  testing. performing the test and using the app were rated as comfortable/very comfortable
  in over 80% of the cohort. Discussion(s): Most study participants in this Australian
  cohort were compliant with frequent home-based RATs. By study end most participants
  (93.8%) found the testing process acceptable/very acceptable. There is need for
  further work on the cost-effectiveness and impact of self-tested RATs under a range
  of specific uses and conditions. Conclusion(s): This study provided valuable information
  on acceptability and feasibility of regular home-based testing which could be applied
  to other diseases. Ongoing community engagement with clear information on RATs including
  accuracy and use cases is important for decision-making and addressing concerns,
  particularly for linguistically diverse peoples.Copyright Â© 2023'
