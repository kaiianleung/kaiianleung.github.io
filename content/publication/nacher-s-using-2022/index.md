abstract: 'Methods: PAR generally entails a 4-phase process: Planning, Action, Reflection,
  and Evaluation. A collaborative, ground-up approach was used in which bilingual,
  bicultural, native Spanishlanguage stakeholder translators and researchers co-created
  a translation planning framework that involved capacity building (e.g., on-going
  mindfulness immersion and practice by the translators), meeting weekly to share
  ideas, updates, insights, and concerns and creating a space to reflect on the multicultural
  lineage of this project (Pali/Sanskrit, English, Spanish) and linguistic and cultural
  considerations to keep in mind when adapting Wakeful for a Spanish-language audience.
  Result(s): A 4-phase PAR translation methodology entailed both translators exchanging
  the roles of primary translator and reviewer, which ensured that both translators
  had equal input on the translation of the entire script, without each having to
  translate the full script separately. In line with PAR, the translators were encouraged
  to trust their respective linguistic and cultural intuitions as a primary source
  for translating the script from English to Spanish and to conduct independent confirmatory
  research whenever necessary to check their choices and decisions if there was any
  doubt. Background(s): Participatory-action research (PAR) is an antioppressive,
  equity-empowering approach in which researchers and community stakeholders engage
  in an iterative, collaborative process together to enact social justice and change
  through shared research. To our knowledge, this approach has never been implemented
  as a part of linguistic translation, let alone translation of a mind-body intervention
  where socio-cultural factors may play a large role in understanding and uptake.
  The purpose of this abstract is to present themethodology of translating an English-languagemindfulness
  application (Wakeful) into Spanish using PAR principles. Conclusion(s): The Spanish
  version of Wakeful is inclusive and accessible, providing Spanish-speaking communities
  with a linguistically sound and culturally informed tool. The PAR translation methodology
  is innovative and applicable for any integrative medicine tool or program that needs
  to be translated.'
