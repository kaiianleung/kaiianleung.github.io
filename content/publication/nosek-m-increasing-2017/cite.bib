 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children of Latino immigrants often are torn between their native homes and new communities. Having supportive interpersonal relationships increases resilience to delinquent and violent behaviors stemming from immigration challenges. Communication fostering empathy may improve conflict resolution and supportive relationships. OBJECTIVE(S): Community-based participatory research (CBPR) was conducted to evaluate the impact of nonviolent communication (NVC) trainings in Latino adults and youth. METHOD(S): Four sessions in NVC were provided by bilingual Latino trainers for Latino adults and youth. Pre- and post-training focus groups evaluated effectiveness of training. RESULT(S): Three themes emerged from adult post training focus groups-enter the others' shoes, making a change, and learning in community. The youth reflected on new ways to manage conflict and understand emotions. LESSONS LEARNED: Research team embedded in community increased success. However, inconsistent participant attendance precluded quantitative analyses. CONCLUSION(S): Seeds were planted in this Latino community for future potential projects.},
