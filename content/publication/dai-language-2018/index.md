abstract: "Background: Parents and providers are sometimes concerned that exposure
  to two languages will impair language acquisition in children with autism spectrum
  disorder (ASD) or other developmental disorders (DD). However, research to date
  suggests that language milestones and abilities are unaffected by this exposure.
  The current study explored language abilities in toddlers with ASD or DD exposed
  to one versus multiple languages, prior to intervention. To our knowledge, this
  is the largest investigation of language learning in bilingual-exposed (BE) children
  with ASD., Methods: Participants were 388 children evaluated as part of a larger
  study on the early detection of ASD. Parents were asked to list all languages that
  primary caretakers use to communicate with their child. One hundred six BE children
  (57 ASD, 49 DD) were compared to 282 monolingual-exposed (ME) children (176 ASD,
  106 DD). The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assessed nonverbal and verbal abilities.
  Multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BE to language abilities,
  beyond the influence of nonverbal cognitive abilities, diagnosis, and socioeconomic
  status., Results: Results showed greater language impairment in ASD than DD, but
  no main effect for language exposure group nor any interaction of language group
  by diagnosis. Results remained consistent after controlling for socioeconomic status.,
  Conclusion: This study suggests that bilingual caregivers can communicate with their
  children in both languages without adverse effects on their children's language
  functioning."
