abstract: "BACKGROUND: Cambodian Americans have higher rates of health problems compared
  with the general U.S. POPULATION: A relatively modest community capacity for collecting
  data contributes to these disparities. OBJECTIVE(S): To (1) further develop the
  Cambodian American community's capacity to design and conduct health research meaningful
  to their community via a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach,
  (2) train and deploy bilingual community health workers (CHWs) to gather health-related
  data from their communities using mobile technology, and (3) measure the feasibility
  and effectiveness of our efforts. METHOD(S): A CBPR approach was used to engage
  leaders of Cambodian American communities in six states to identify their research
  needs, develop a short community health survey administered by CHWs, and conduct
  the survey using iPads programmed in Khmer spoken-language format. Administrative
  logs and surveys of CHWs and leaders measured feasibility and effectiveness of the
  project. RESULT(S): CHWs, leaders, and community members reported largely positive
  experiences with the community health survey, despite poor/inconsistent Internet
  connectivity. The institutional capacity of Cambodian American community-based organizations
  to collect health-related data in their own communities was strengthened. Our efforts
  proved to be both feasible and effective. CONCLUSION(S): The use of mobile technology
  with spoken format can be a valuable tool in accessing input from vulnerable community
  members, including persons who may not be literate in any language. Trained CHWs,
  backed by dedicated and experienced community leaders, are an asset to their communities.
  Together, they are uniquely placed to make important contributions to the well-being
  of their community."
