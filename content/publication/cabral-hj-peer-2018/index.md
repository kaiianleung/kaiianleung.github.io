abstract: 'Racial/ethnic minorities living with HIV and behavioral health co-morbidities
  are more likely to be disengaged from HIV primary care. Peer programs have been
  effective in HIV outreach and prevention but effectiveness of such programs for
  retention in care and viral suppression is understudied. Subjects (n = 348) were
  randomized in equal allocation to a peer navigation and education intervention versus
  standard clinical care at three urban clinics in the United States. The intervention
  group received seven structured interventions plus weekly contact to address medical
  and social needs. Primary outcomes included time-to-first 4-month gap in HIV care
  and viral suppression up to 12 months of follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis
  showed no difference between groups on 4-month gap in HIV primary care, but subgroup
  analysis showed a suggestive effect of the peer intervention in reducing gaps in
  care among stably housed subjects. Fully compliant subjects in the peer intervention
  experienced significantly fewer 4-month gaps in HIV primary care (p textless 0.0001).
  Those in the peer group who had more clinical face-to-face encounters in the first
  3 months were also significantly more likely to have better retention in care (p
  = 0.04). There were no significant differences between any study subgroups in viral
  suppression at 12 months. Peer interventions may improve retention in primary care
  among subgroups of people living with HIV from racial/ethnic minority communities,
  although such improved retention may not increase viral load suppression. Attending
  and completing structured educational sessions along with early, intensive contact
  with peers could improve retention in HIV primary care for patients. Future peer
  programs should consider training on housing referral systems to help increase retention
  for patients who are not stably housed. clinicaltrials.gov registration number:
