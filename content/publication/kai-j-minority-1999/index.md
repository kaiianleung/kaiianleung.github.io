abstract: "Objectives: To promote community participation in exploring perceptions
  of psychological distress amongst Pakistani and Bangladeshi people, in order to
  develop appropriate services. Design(s): Training and facilitation of resident community
  members (as community project workers), to define and conduct qualitative research
  involving semistructured interviews in their own communities, informing primary
  care led commissioning and service decision making. Setting(s): A socio-economically
  disadvantaged inner-city locality in the UK. Participant(s): One-hundred and four
  South Asian people (49 of Pakistani and 55 of Bangladeshi origin), interviewed by
  13 resident community members. Result(s): All community project workers completed
  training leading to a National Vocational Qualification, and successfully executed
  the research. Most study respondents located their main sources of stress within
  pervasive experience of racism and socio-economic disadvantage. They were positive
  about 'talking' and neutral listening as helpful, but sought strategies beyond non-directive
  counselling services that embraced practical welfare advice and social support.
  The roles of primary health care professionals were believed to be restricted to
  physical ill health rather than personal distress. The importance of professionals'
  sex, age, ethnicity and social status were emphasized as affecting open communication.
  Practical recommendations for the re-orientation and provision of services were
  generated and implemented in response to the findings, through dialogue with a primary
  care commissioning group, Health and Local Authority, and voluntary agencies. Conclusion(s):
  The work illustrates the feasibility and value of a community participation approach
  to research and service development in addressing a challenging and neglected area
  of minority ethnic health need. It offers one model for generating responsive service
  change in the context of current health policy in the UK, whilst also imparting
  skills and empowering community members. The study findings emphasize the need to
  recognize the social contexts in which distress is experienced and have implications
  for effective responses."
