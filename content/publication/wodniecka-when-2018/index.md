abstract: The accumulating evidence suggests that prior usage of a second language
  (L2) leads to processing costs on the subsequent production of a native language
  (L1). However, it is unclear mechanism underlies this effect. It has been proposed
  that the L1 cost reflects inhibition of L1 representation acting during L1 production;
  however, previous studies exploring this issue were inconclusive. It is also unsettled
  whether the mechanism operates on the whole-language level or is restricted to translation
  equivalents in the two languages. We report a study that allowed us to address both
  issues behaviorally with the use of ERPs while focusing on the consequences of using
  L2 on the production of L1. In our experiment, native speakers of Polish (L1) and
  learners of English (L2) named a set of pictures in L1 following a set of pictures
  in either L1 or L2. Half of the pictures were repeated from the preceding block
  and half were new; this enabled dissociation of the effects on the level of the
  whole language from those specific to individual lexical items. Our results are
  consistent with the notion that language after-effects operate at a whole-language
  level. Behaviorally, we observed a clear processing cost on the whole-language level
  and a small facilitation on the item-specific level. The whole-language effect was
  accompanied by an enhanced, fronto-centrally distributed negativity in the 250–350ms
  time-window which we identified as the N300 (in contrast to previous research, which
  probably misidentified the effect as the N2), a component that presumably reflects
  retrieval difficulty of relevant language representations during picture naming.
  As such, unlike previous studies that reported N2 for naming pictures in L1 after
  L2 use, we propose that the reported ERPs (N300) indicate that prior usage of L2
  hampers lexical access to names in L1. Based on the literature, the after-effects
  could be caused by L1 inhibition and/or L2 interference, but the ERPs so far have
  not been informative about the causal mechanism.
