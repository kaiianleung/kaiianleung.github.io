 abstract = {Background: Effective family-school partnerships can improve outcomes for autistic students. Yet, we know little about what effective partnerships look like for parents of autistic children from different cultural backgrounds, especially in an Australian context. Here, we provide insight into the first-hand experiences of Vietnamese parents living in Australia as they navigated education for their autistic children. Method(s): Using participatory methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Vietnamese parents of autistic children (3 - 18 years) attending Australian kindergarten/schools to understand their experiences of parent-teacher interactions. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified three key themes and associated subthemes. Result(s): Parent priorities were caregiving and their children's education. They were clearly respectful of, and deferential towards, teachers and were also concerned about the potential repercussions of advocating for their children. Parents expressed gratitude for what Australia afforded them, often feeling undeserving of additional supports. Not being proficient in English was challenging, especially during periods of pandemic-related remote learning. Stigma and discrimination were commonly experienced, especially towards mothers. Despite challenges, parents fought for what they felt was best for their children, but this advocacy took its toll with stress, exhaustion and isolation frequently described. Culturally-specific services were a key source of assistance. Conclusion(s): This work has implications for how teachers and schools can foster successful relationships with Vietnamese parents of autistic children. Recommendations for schools include supporting families' language preferences, explicitly scaffolding parent advocacy training as well as student self-advocacy strategies and ensuring that the wellbeing of both children and parents is prioritised by schools.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd},
