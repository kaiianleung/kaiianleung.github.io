abstract: 'Children have an early ability to learn and comprehend words, a skill that
  develops as they age. A critical question remains regarding what drives this development.
  Maturation-based theories emphasise cognitive maturity as a driver of comprehension,
  while accumulator theories emphasise children’s accumulation of language experience
  over time. In this study we used archival looking-while-listening data from 155
  children aged 14–48 months with a range of exposure to the target languages (from
  10% to 100%) to evaluate the relative contributions of maturation and experience.
  We compared four statistical models of noun learning: maturation-only, experience-only,
  additive (maturation plus experience), and accumulator (maturation times experience).
  The best-fitting model was the additive model in which both maturation (age) and
  experience were independent contributors to noun comprehension: older children as
  well as children who had more experience with the target language were more accurate
  and looked faster to the target in the looking-while-listening task. A 25% change
  in relative language exposure was equivalent to a 4 month change in age, and age
  effects were stronger at younger than at older ages. Whereas accumulator models
  predict that the lexical development of children with less exposure to a language
  (as is typical in bilinguals) should fall further and further behind children with
  more exposure to a language (such as monolinguals), our results indicate that bilinguals
  are buffered against effects of reduced exposure in each language. This study shows
  that continuous-level measures from individual children’s looking-while-listening
  data, gathered from children with a range of language experience, provide a powerful
  window into lexical development.'
