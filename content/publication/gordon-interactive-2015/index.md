abstract: "BACKGROUND: As the kidney shortage continues to grow, patients on the waitlist
  are increasingly turning to live kidney donors for transplantation. Despite having
  a disproportionately higher prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), fewer
  waitlisted Hispanic patients received living donor kidney transplants (LDKTs) than
  non-Hispanic whites in 2014. Although lack of knowledge has been identified as a
  barrier to living kidney donation (LKD) among Hispanics, little is known about information
  needs, and few bilingual educational resources provide transplant-related information
  addressing Hispanics' specific concerns., OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the process
  of developing a bilingual website targeted to the Hispanic community. The website
  was designed to increase knowledge about LKD among Hispanic patients with ESKD,
  their families, and the public, and was inspired by educational sessions targeted
  to Hispanic transplant patients provided by Northwestern University's Hispanic Kidney
  Transplant Program., METHODS: Northwestern faculty partnered with the National Kidney
  Foundation of Illinois for expertise in ESKD and Hispanic community partners across
  the Chicago area. We established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of 10 Chicago-area
  Hispanic community leaders to provide insight into cultural concerns and community
  and patients' needs. Website content development was informed by 9 focus groups
  with 76 adult Hispanic kidney transplant recipients, living kidney donors, dialysis
  patients, and the general Hispanic public. The website development effort was guided
  by community input on images, telenovela scripts, and messages. After initial development,
  formal usability testing was conducted with 18 adult Hispanic kidney transplant
  recipients, dialysis patients, and living kidney donors to identify ways to improve
  navigability, design, content, comprehension, and cultural sensitivity. Usability
  testing revealed consistently high ratings as \\\"easy to navigate\\\", \\\"informative\\\
  \", and \\\"culturally appropriate\\\". Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and Gagne's
  Conditions of Learning Theory guided website design to facilitate adult learning.,
  RESULTS: The website, \\\"Informate: Living Kidney Donation for Hispanics/Latinos\\\
  \" (Informate Acerca de la Donacion de Rinon en Vida), includes six sections: Treatment
  Options, Donation: Step-by-Step, Benefits and Risks, Financial Issues, Immigrant
  Issues, and Cultural Beliefs and Myths. Sections host 5-10 interactive messages
  that summarize important points and link to detailed explanations for users interested
  in learning more about specific issues. The website hosts interactive videos, multimedia
  testimonials, telenovelas, games, and quizzes. Photographs and videos of Hispanic
  living donors are shown to promote pride and ownership., CONCLUSIONS: Our success
  in developing a website was driven by a development team with expertise in transplantation,
  social science, evaluation, instructional design, and Hispanic perspectives, and
  by a patient-centered approach toward content and design. Based on feedback from
  usability testing and our CAB, the website is sensitive to Hispanic cultural sensibilities.
  We have nearly completed a formal evaluation of the website's impact on increasing
  Hispanics' knowledge about LKD and will disseminate the website thereafter."
