abstract: 'The Ububele Baby Mat Service is a community-based, parent–infant mental
  health intervention offered at five primary health care clinics in Alexandra Township,
  in Johannesburg. The aim of the intervention is to promote healthy caregiver-infant
  attachments. There has been a steady increase in the number of mother-baby dyads
  making use of the service. This paper aims to explore how the Baby Mat Service and
  Baby Mat practitioners position and locate themselves in a culturally diverse community
  setting where multiple meaning systems are drawn on for making sense of health concerns.
  Two key components of the Baby Mat Service are discussed: i) the presence of an
  inter-racial therapeutic couple on the mat; and ii) the stance adopted by the Baby
  Mat practitioners in relation to culturally diverse understandings of a presenting
  problem. The therapeutic couple engages with culturally-informed frames of reference
  in an attitude of wondering and tentative thinking (“mhlawumbe”in isiZulu). When
  a respectfully curious stance was taken by practitioners, it was found to help those
  accessing the mat to find symbolic meaning in the presenting problem and integrate
  this with cultural understandings.'
