abstract: The underlying psychosocial processes that produce immigrant mental wellbeing
  are understudied in anthropology and medicine. This paper provides insights into
  these processes by describing culturally diverse immigrants' perceptions of mental
  health and adaptation strategies. Qualitative data were collected from 21 focus
  groups as part of a large, multidisciplinary, participatory action research project
  about mental health with five ethnolinguistic groups (Mandarin-speaking Chinese,
  Polish, Punjabi Sikh, Somali and Spanish-speaking Latin American) in Ontario, Canada.
  In framing the analysis, transformative concepts are applied to address dimensions
  of power and culture - social liminality and cultural negotiation - to the ongoing
  psychosocial processes of coping with mental distress. 'Social liminality' describes
  how immigrants perceive themselves to be in a psychologically stressful, transitional
  state, whereas 'cultural negotiation' describes how they actively cope with cultural
  tensions and respond to mental health challenges. Study findings show that while
  social liminality and cultural negotiation are stressful, they also have the potential
  to help individuals adapt by producing a positive synthesis of ideas about mental
  health in new social and cultural contexts. The study contributes to the shift from
  problem identification using a biomedical model of mental illness to a more psychosocial
  and ecological approach that reveals the potential for resolving some mental health
  problems experienced in immigrant communities. Describing active psychosocial process
  of adaptation also reinforces the therapeutic and educational value of partnerships
  between practitioners and clients and immigrant communities and mental health systems.
