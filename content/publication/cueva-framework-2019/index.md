abstract: "Culturally relevant health promotion is an opportunity to reduce health
  inequities in diseases with modifiable risks, such as cancer. Alaska Native people
  bear a disproportionate cancer burden, and Alaska's rural tribal health workers
  consequently requested cancer education accessible online. In response, the Alaska
  Native Tribal Health Consortium cancer education team sought to create a framework
  for culturally relevant online learning to inform the creation of distance-delivered
  cancer education. Guided by the principles of community-based participatory action
  research and grounded in empowerment theory, the project team conducted a focus
  group with 10 Alaska Native education experts, 12 culturally diverse key informant
  interviews, a key stakeholder survey of 62 Alaska Native tribal health workers and
  their instructors/supervisors, and a literature review on distance-delivered education
  with Alaska Native or American Indian people. Qualitative findings were analyzed
  in Atlas.ti, with common themes presented in this article as a framework for culturally
  relevant online education. This proposed framework includes four principles: collaborative
  development, interactive content delivery, contextualizing learning, and creating
  connection. As an Alaskan tribal health worker shared \\\"we're all in this together.
  All about conversations, relationships. Always learn from you/with you, together
  what we know and understand from the center of our experience, our ways of knowing,
  being, caring.\\\" The proposed framework has been applied to support cancer education
  and promote cancer control with Alaska Native people and has motivated health behavior
  change to reduce cancer risk. This framework may be adaptable to other populations
  to guide effective and culturally relevant online interventions."
