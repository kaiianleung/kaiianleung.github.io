abstract: 'BACKGROUND: National asthma guidelines are often not translated into practice.
  Barriers to translation impactboth provider and patient adherence., PURPOSE: This
  qualitative study describes how perceptions and experiences of patients with asthma
  or their caregivers affect disease management in a Puerto Rican community in Buffalo,
  NY., METHODS: Two community-based asthma workshops following a focus group format
  were conducted with 22 Puerto Rican adults with asthma or who cared for asthmatic
  children. A bilingual-bicultural community moderator used a semistructured interview
  guide to foster discussion on asthma definitions, triggers, management, coping and
  concerns. Four analysts interpreted data transcripts following the grounded theory
  approach, identifying salient thematic categories. Multiple analysts and a postsearch
  for conflicting evidence support analytical trustworthiness., RESULTS: Perceptions
  of illness revealed concerns about the deceiving character and burden of asthma.
  Recognition of indoor household triggers underscored concerns about the impact on
  quality of life, emergency department use, and the ineffectiveness or side effects
  of some prescribed therapies. Misconceptions about asthma and self-management strategies
  were identified., CONCLUSIONS: Learning about lay perceptions and management approaches
  regarding asthma may afford healthcare professionals insight to better understand,
  educate and care for ethnic minority patients, and help to improve their asthma
  outcomes.'
