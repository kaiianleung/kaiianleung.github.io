abstract: 'Background: Speech-language pathology services are among the most frequently
  accessed services for young autistic children. Therefore, understanding the nature
  of these services, what challenges these clinicians face, and what supports they
  value is critical for developing appropriate policies and practices that can maximize
  positive outcomes for children and families. This study had two primary aims. The
  first was to examine the self-reported assessment and intervention practices of
  community-based Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) and communicative disorders
  assistants (CDAs; who provide services under the supervision of a SLP) in supporting
  preschool children with suspected and diagnosed autism. The second aim was to identify
  barriers and supports (facilitators) to providing services in the community using
  the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a framework., Methods:
  A cross-sectional online survey was used to collect qualitative and quantitative
  data from clinicians in Ontario Canada who were providing speech and language services
  to preschool children with suspected or diagnosed autism. Quantitative data were
  used to describe clinicians\" practices, and qualitative data captured their perspectives
  on barriers and supports to providing services., Results: A total of 258 clinicians
  participated in the survey. On average, clinicians reported almost half of the preschoolers
  on their caseload had either diagnosed or suspected autism. There was consistency
  across the skill development areas assessed by SLPs, and targeted during therapy
  sessions, with the top four areas targeted being: foundational social communication,
  language, play and pragmatics. However, there was wide variation in speech and language
  assessment and intervention practices reported by this sample of clinicians (i.e.,
  service delivery models, tools or programs used, length and duration of therapy
  services, level of collaboration with other professionals). Clinicians identified
  several barriers to providing services: limited funding and time, lack of inter-professional
  collaboration, difficulty accessing services, community messaging about autism services,
  family readiness and clinician knowledge. Supports (facilitators) included: access
  to autism-focused professional development, inter- and intra-professional collaboration,
  and access to additional supports in the community. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2022.'
