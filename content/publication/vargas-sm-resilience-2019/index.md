abstract: 'Introduction Depression is the leading cause of adult disability and common
  among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults. The current study builds on findings
  showing the effectiveness of depression quality improvement (QI) and delivery of
  cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) skills provided by community health workers
  in reducing depression. Depression QI approaches across healthcare and social/community
  services in safety-net settings have shown improvements in mental wellness, mental
  health quality of life and depression over 12 months. Further, a randomised study
  showed improved depression among low-income racial/ethnic minorities enrolled in
  a CBT-informed resiliency class (Building Resilience and Increasing Community Hope
  (B-RICH)). The current protocol describes a comparativeness effectiveness study
  to evaluate whether predominantly low-income, SGM racial/ethnic minority adults
  randomised to a CBT-informed resiliency class have improvements in depressive symptoms
  over and above community-engaged QI resources and training only. Methods and analysis
  The study approached three clusters of four to five programs serving predominantly
  SGM and racial/ethnic minority communities in the USA: two clusters in Los Angeles,
  California, and one in New Orleans, Louisiana. Clusters are comprised of one primary
  care, one mental health and two to three community agencies (eg, faith-based, social
  services/support, advocacy). All programs received depression QI training. The current
  study employed a community-partnered participatory research model to adapt the CBT-informed
  resiliency class, B-RICH+, to SGM communities. Study participants were screened
  and recruited in person from participating programs, and will complete baseline,
  6- and 12-month survey follow-ups. Participants were depressed adults (8-item Patient
  Health Questionnaire textgreater=10; textgreater=18 years of age) who provided contact
  information. Enrolled participants were individually randomised to B-RICH+ or depression
  QI alone. Primary outcomes are depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes are mental
  health quality of life, mental wellness and physical health quality of life. Data
  collection for this study is ongoing. Ethics and dissemination The current study
  was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Study findings will be disseminated
  through scientific publications and community conferences. Trial registration number
