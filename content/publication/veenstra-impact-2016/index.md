abstract: Impairments in executive skills broadly span across multiple childhood epilepsy
  syndromes and can adversely affect quality of life. Bilingualism has been previously
  shown to correlate with enhanced executive functioning in healthy individuals. This
  study sought to determine whether the bilingual advantage in executive functioning
  exists in the context of pediatric epilepsy. We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychological
  data in 52 children with epilepsy and compared executive function scores in monolingual
  versus bilingual children with epilepsy while controlling for socioeconomic status
  and ethnicity. Bilingual children performed significantly better on the Working
  Memory Index than did monolingual children. There were no significant differences
  on the remaining executive function variables. The bilingual advantage appears to
  persist for working memory in children with epilepsy. These findings suggest that
  bilingualism is potentially a protective variable in the face of epilepsy-related
  working memory dysfunction. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
