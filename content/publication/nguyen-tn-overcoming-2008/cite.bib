 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of theoretical concepts in community-based, culturally tailored health navigation programs that have improved access to health care for ethnic minority populations, particularly for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. DATA SOURCES: Published articles, reports, book chapters, government documents, research findings. CONCLUSION: Community-based patient navigation interventions provide promising strategies for providing culturally tailored programs that are more likely to succeed in eliminating cancer disparities in screening and early detection of cancers for diverse cultural communities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses need to be more involved in developing and delivering effective, culturally competent community-based cancer screening and treatment navigation programs through education, practice, research, and policy improvement.Copyright Â© 2008 by Elsevier Inc.},
