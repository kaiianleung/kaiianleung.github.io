abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of theoretical concepts in community-based,
  culturally tailored health navigation programs that have improved access to health
  care for ethnic minority populations, particularly for Asian Americans and Pacific
  Islanders. DATA SOURCES: Published articles, reports, book chapters, government
  documents, research findings. CONCLUSION: Community-based patient navigation interventions
  provide promising strategies for providing culturally tailored programs that are
  more likely to succeed in eliminating cancer disparities in screening and early
  detection of cancers for diverse cultural communities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
  PRACTICE: Nurses need to be more involved in developing and delivering effective,
  culturally competent community-based cancer screening and treatment navigation programs
  through education, practice, research, and policy improvement.Copyright Â© 2008 by
