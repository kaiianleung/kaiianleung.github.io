 abstract = {The Asthma Linking Project was a joint project of the Royal Children's Hospital and North Richmond Community Health Centre, in Melbourne. The primary aim of this longitudinal project was to evaluate the effectiveness of community based asthma education and support provided to culturally and linguistically diverse families and those with other complex health and social needs. The project, which took place between 1996 and 2000, evaluated a range of health and quality of life outcomes for 50 children and their families, using a triangulated approach incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. This paper presents five qualitative themes which were identified as important contributors to optimal asthma education and support with this inner city population: time and timing; language and cultural appropriateness; tailoring education and support to needs; collaboration and coordination of care; and educator-participant relationship. These themes are likely to be relevant to other health promotion and community development projects with similar populations.},
