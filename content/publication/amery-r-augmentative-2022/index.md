abstract: Yolnu, Aboriginal people from Arnhem Land, Australia are at risk of Machado-Joseph
  disease, with progressive loss of speech. Yolnu are interested in developing augmentative
  and alternative communication (AAC) systems in their own languages. This research
  aimed to develop a culturally responsive process to explore and create a core vocabulary
  word list for Yolnu adults living with the disease for inclusion in AAC system prototypes.
  A list of 243 Yolnu words and morphemes was created. In this highly collaborative,
  mixed methods, participatory action research, Balanda (the Yolnu word for non-Aboriginal
  people) and Yolnu researchers conducted cycles of transcription and analysis of
  a language sample, with oral group discussions to identify which words to include,
  omit, or add, based on Yolnu perceptions of the structure and use of their languages.
  A Yolnu metaphor, Gulaka-buma (\"Harvesting yams\"), was identified by Yolnu researchers
  to represent and share the research process and findings. Three key themes were
  identified that summarize the main cultural and linguistic considerations related
  to changes made to the core vocabulary. Study findings emphasized the role of language
  as an expression of culture and identity for Indigenous peoples and the importance
  of considering cultural and linguistic factors in selecting vocabulary for AAC systems.
