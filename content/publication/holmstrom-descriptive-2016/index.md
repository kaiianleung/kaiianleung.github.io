abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe the development of Arabic and Swedish
  lexical organisation in bilingual children with language impairment (BLI)., METHOD:
  Lexical organisation was assessed through word associations in 10 BLI and 10 bilingual
  children with typical development (BTD), aged 6;2-8;0 years, matched for age and
  gender. The participants were assessed twice, with a 1-year interval. Word associations
  were coded as paradigmatic, syntagmatic, phonological, other and no answer. This
  study reports analyses of the semantically-related syntagmatic and paradigmatic
  associations. Using repeated measures ANOVA, main and interaction effects of Group,
  Time and Language were examined for paradigmatic and syntagmatic associations separately.,
  RESULT: The interaction between Group and Time was significant for both associations.
  The BLI group increased syntagmatic associations from time 1 to time 2, while the
  BTD group increased paradigmatic associations. Results showed a significant main
  effect of Language for both types of associations, with better performance in Swedish.
  Significant Group by Language interactions resulted from lower Arabic than Swedish
  syntagmatic and paradigmatic scores for the BLI and BTD groups, respectively., CONCLUSION:
  Differing developmental trajectories indicate that bilingual children with LI develop
  lexical organisation at a slower pace than bilingual peers with typical language
  development.'
