abstract: Background. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related
  death in the United States. Despite universal screening recommendations, screening
  rates in the United States remain suboptimal, especially among the poor, the uninsured,
  recent immigrants, and Hispanics. This article describes the development of a large
  community-based colorectal cancer screening program designed to address these disparities.
  Method. The Against Colorectal Cancer in our Neighborhoods program is a bilingual,
  evidence-based, theory-guided, multicomponent community screening intervention,
  targeting the uninsured and developed using a systematic planning process. It combines
  community health workerâ€“led outreach, bilingual and culturally tailored community
  education, and no-cost screening with provision of the fecal immunochemical test
  or colonoscopy and navigation services. A detailed process and outcome evaluation
  is planned. Program development cost calculated prospectively (in 2011 dollars)
  using a societal perspective and micro-costing methods was $243,278, of which $180,344
  was direct cost. Discussion. The detailed description of the development processes
  and costs of this health promotion program targeting low-income Hispanics will inform
  health program decision makers about the resource requirements for planning and
  developing new programs to reduce disease burden in communities.
