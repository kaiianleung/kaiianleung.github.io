abstract: 'Introduction: Inadequate sleep is highly prevalent among socioeconomically
  disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities, and is often related to sleep
  health behaviors, stress, and adverse environmental conditions. While socio-contextually
  appropriate sleep health education and yoga interventions may improve sleep and
  mitigate adverse effects and reactivity to environmental stressors, there is scant
  research specifically addressing how to effectively deliver these interventions
  in underrepresented communities. Method(s): We conducted a pilot study of a combined
  sleep health and yoga intervention among racially/ethnically diverse adults residing
  in low-income housing communities, who reported sleeping less than 6 hours a night
  (n=23). The intervention consisted sequentially of: one group sleep health education
  session (1-hour), one telephone coaching session (15 minutes), and four weekly 1-hour
  yoga classes. Twotailed Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests assessed pre- and post-intervention
  changes in self-reported sleep duration, scores from the PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment
  and Sleep Disturbance Short Forms, Sleep Hygiene Index, and validated stress and
  mood assessments. Quantitative and qualitative data assessed intervention acceptability.
  Result(s): Mean participant age was 41.4 years +/- 19.6; 80.7% were female; 61.5%
  identified as non-Hispanic Black and less than 20% had a college degree. Results
  showed significant pre/post intervention improvements in sleep duration (5.3 +/-
  0.9 hours/night versus 7.2 +/- 1.7 hours/night [p=.02]), sleep-related impairment
  (p=.002), sleep disturbance (p=.002), and sleep health behaviors (p=.021). Attendance
  (100% received sleep health education; 47.8% attended at least 2 of 4 yoga classes),
  intervention feedback scores (73.7% rated the sleep education session as helpful
  or very helpful; 63.2% strongly agreed that the yoga class left them feeling relaxed
  and less stressed), and qualitative data (e.g., \"What I liked least about the program
  was when it ended, because it was so good?) support the acceptability of the intervention.
  Conclusion(s): Pilot study results indicate intervention acceptability and promising
  effects on improvement of sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, and sleep
  health behaviors. A larger, randomized control trial is planned to elucidate and
  disentangle the effects of sleep health education and yoga practice on sleep.'
