 abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to describe the development, implementation, and process evaluation findings of a culturally tailored diabetes lifestyle intervention for African Americans and Latinos. METHODS: African American and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes from 3 health care systems in Detroit, Michigan, participated in diabetes lifestyle intervention of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Detroit Partnership. The intervention curricula were culturally and linguistically tailored for each population. Trained community residents delivered the curricula in 5 group meetings aimed at improving dietary, physical activity, and diabetes self-care behaviors of study participants. The aims of the process evaluation were to assess participant satisfaction with the intervention, utility, and applicability of information and cultural relevance of intervention materials. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Matrices were developed along thematic lines, and common themes were determined by grouping responses by question. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants attended 1 or more intervention classes; 41% attended all 5 meetings. Attendance rates ranged from 59% to 88% for individual meetings. Participants reported that program information and activities were useful, culturally relevant, and applicable to diabetes self-management. Participants also appreciated the convenient community location for meetings and the social support received from other participants. CONCLUSIONS: A community-based, culturally tailored diabetes lifestyle intervention delivered by trained community residents was associated with high participant satisfaction and retention.},
