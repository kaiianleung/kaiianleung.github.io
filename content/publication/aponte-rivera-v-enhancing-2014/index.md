abstract: Background Hispanics, particularly those with limited English proficiency,
  are underrepresented in psychiatric clinical research studies. We developed a bilingual
  and bicultural research clinic dedicated to the recruitment and treatment of Spanish-speaking
  subjects in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined
  Treatments (PReDICT) study, a large clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects with
  major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Demographic and clinical data derived from
  screening evaluations of the first 1,174 subjects presenting for participation were
  compared between the Spanish-speaking site (N = 275) and the primary English-speaking
  site (N = 899). Reasons for ineligibility (N = 888) for the PReDICT study were tallied
  for each site. Results Compared to English speakers, Spanish speakers had a lower
  level of education and were more likely to be female, uninsured, and have uncontrolled
  medical conditions. Clinically, Spanish speakers demonstrated greater depression
  severity, with higher mean symptom severity scores, and a greater number of previous
  suicide attempts. Among the subjects who were not randomized into the PReDICT study,
  Spanish-speaking subjects were more likely to have an uncontrolled medical condition
  or refuse participation, whereas English-speaking subjects were more likely to have
  bipolar disorder or a non-MDD depressive disorder. Conclusion Recruitment of Hispanic
  subjects with MDD is feasible and may enhance efforts at signal detection, given
  the higher severity of depression among Spanish-speaking participants presenting
  for clinical trials. Specific approaches for the recruitment and retention of Spanish-speaking
  participants are required. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
