abstract: "Background: Men's Sheds are community-based places where men can enjoy
  each other's company and where self-worth can be promoted through the development
  of artistic or manual skills. The Shed helps men to strengthen and maintain social
  links and continue to feel they are useful members of the community once they have
  retired from the workforce. Method(s): The Building Healthy Men Project (BHMP) used
  the Men's Shed model to provide a group of retired and/or unemployed men from culturally
  and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds with opportunities to develop new
  skills, reduce their social isolation and increase their self-esteem and sense of
  purpose in an area of relative social disadvantage.This paper aims to contribute
  evidence on the types of outcomes for men's health and well-being that can be achieved
  and measured through their participation in a Men's Shed. Evaluation: The evaluation
  used a Participatory Action Research (PAR) process including a variety of data collection
  tools to examine the project processes and outcomes. Result(s): The evaluation showed
  that as a result of their involvement in the project the men increased their sense
  of purpose, self worth and self confidence. They also broadened their social networks
  and increased their skill levels. Conclusion(s): The BHMP evaluation highlighted
  lessons on the implementation and effects of an all-male social support network
  and the domains of outcome measurement that would be useful in health promotion
  programs targeting men from culturally diverse backgrounds in a socially disadvantaged
  area. Â© 2010 WPMH GmbH."
