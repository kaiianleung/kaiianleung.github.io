abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Resilience entails drawing on resources to navigate adversity;
  few measures exist to explore how children cope with adversity in varying cultural
  contexts. PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a socially-inclusive measure of child resilience
  by (1) co-designing methods to engage diverse families, and (2) identifying resilience
  factors. METHOD(S): We used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach
  to recruit Aboriginal families, refugee families, and families from hospital outpatient
  clinics. To triangulate findings and codesign methods, we held discussion groups
  with 21 service providers. Codesigned group-based visual methods were employed in
  discussion groups with 97 parents and 106 children (5-12 years). FINDINGS: Participants
  identified culturally-meaningful resilience factors such as loving family, speaking
  their home language (for families of Non-English speaking backgrounds). We discuss
  differences and commonalities across participant groups. CONCLUSION(S): Co-designing
  research that is both rigorous and inclusive is critical for gleaning culturally-meaningful
  data from diverse families.'
