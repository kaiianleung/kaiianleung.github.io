abstract: The performance of 8- to 13-year-old monolingual English-speaking children
  with language impairment (LI) on seven nonlinguistic tasks was compared with two
  groups of typically developing children, monolingual English-speaking children,
  and proﬁcient Spanish–English sequential bilingual children. Group differences were
  apparent, with a key ﬁnding that the LI group was observably slower than both typical
  groups in mental rotation and arithmetic, and also slower than the typical monolingual
  group in odd man out, pattern matching, and form completion. Overall, the response
  time (RT) increased equivalently across groups as task difﬁculty increased. Chronological
  age and perceptual–motor speed contributed to task performance, especially for the
  shorter tasks. RT trajectories across the 6-year age span showed that task RT decreased
  with age, but with greater variability for longer tasks that may also be more vulnerable
  to the effect of experience.
