abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Racial/ethnic minority communities in the United States are
  overrepresented among new HIV diagnoses, yet their inclusion in preventive HIV vaccine
  clinical trials is inadequate. An analysis of enrollment demographic characteristics
  from US preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 1988 through 2002 showed that
  enrollment of racial/ethnic minority groups increased. We analyzed enrollment in
  preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 2002 through 2016 and compared our data
  with data from the previous study, described demographic characteristics of trial
  participants, and assessed how well this distribution reflected the racial/ethnic
  distribution of new HIV diagnoses in the United States., METHODS: We examined data
  on demographic characteristics from 43 Phase 1 and Phase 2A preventive HIV vaccine
  clinical trials conducted in the United States and compared the results with those
  of the previous study. We also compared racial/ethnic distributions from 2011 through
  2015 with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on the number of new HIV
  diagnoses during the same period., RESULTS: Of 3469 participants, 1134 (32.7%) identified
  as a racial/ethnic minority, a 94% increase from the previous period (634/3731;
  17.0%). Percentage annual enrollment of all racial/ethnic minority participants
  fluctuated from 17% to 53% from mid-2002 to 2016. Percentages of new HIV diagnoses
  among the general population were 1.9 to 2.9 times the percentage enrollment of
  black participants and 1.3 to 6.6 times the percentage enrollment of Hispanic/Latino
  participants in clinical trials for the same period., CONCLUSIONS: Although enrollment
  of racial/ethnic minority groups into HIV vaccine clinical trials has increased,
  it is not proportional to the number of new HIV diagnoses among these groups. To
  enhance recruitment of racial/ethnic minority groups, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network
  has prioritized community partnerships and invested resources into staff training.'
