 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Racial/ethnic minority communities in the United States are overrepresented among new HIV diagnoses, yet their inclusion in preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials is inadequate. An analysis of enrollment demographic characteristics from US preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 1988 through 2002 showed that enrollment of racial/ethnic minority groups increased. We analyzed enrollment in preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 2002 through 2016 and compared our data with data from the previous study, described demographic characteristics of trial participants, and assessed how well this distribution reflected the racial/ethnic distribution of new HIV diagnoses in the United States., METHODS: We examined data on demographic characteristics from 43 Phase 1 and Phase 2A preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials conducted in the United States and compared the results with those of the previous study. We also compared racial/ethnic distributions from 2011 through 2015 with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on the number of new HIV diagnoses during the same period., RESULTS: Of 3469 participants, 1134 (32.7%) identified as a racial/ethnic minority, a 94% increase from the previous period (634/3731; 17.0%). Percentage annual enrollment of all racial/ethnic minority participants fluctuated from 17% to 53% from mid-2002 to 2016. Percentages of new HIV diagnoses among the general population were 1.9 to 2.9 times the percentage enrollment of black participants and 1.3 to 6.6 times the percentage enrollment of Hispanic/Latino participants in clinical trials for the same period., CONCLUSIONS: Although enrollment of racial/ethnic minority groups into HIV vaccine clinical trials has increased, it is not proportional to the number of new HIV diagnoses among these groups. To enhance recruitment of racial/ethnic minority groups, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network has prioritized community partnerships and invested resources into staff training.},
