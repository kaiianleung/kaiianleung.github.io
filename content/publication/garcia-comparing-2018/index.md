abstract: The current study examined differences in working memory (WM) between monolingual
  and bilingual Hispanic/Latino preschoolers with disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs).
  A total of 149 children (Mage=5.10years, SD=0.53; 76% male) with elevated levels
  of DBDs, as indicated by their parents or teachers, were recruited to participate
  in an 8-week summer program prior to the start of kindergarten (Summer Treatment
  Program for Pre-Kindergarteners). Prior to the start of treatment, parents completed
  several measures about their children's behavior and executive function, and children
  were administered two subtests of the Automated Working Memory Assessment to examine
  their current WM capabilities. After controlling for demographic variables (i.e.,
  age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, and diagnostic status), no significant differences
  were observed between bilingual and monolingual children in verbal WM performance
  (beta=.03, ptextgreater.05). However, children who were bilingual did perform better
  than monolinguals on spatial WM tasks (beta=.23, ptextless.01). Finally, parent
  reports of WM corroborated these findings such that bilingual children were reported
  as having fewer WM problems by parents (beta=-.19, ptextless.05) and teachers (beta=-.22,
  ptextless.05). Whereas WM deficits are often found among children with DBDs, the
  current findings suggest that bilingualism may serve as a protective factor for
  preschoolers with DBDs. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
