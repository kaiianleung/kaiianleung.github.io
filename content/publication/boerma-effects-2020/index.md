abstract: "BACKGROUND: Children's executive functioning (EF) is often negatively associated
  with a developmental language disorder (DLD) and positively related to bilingualism.
  However, both regarding children with DLD and bilingual children, findings are mixed
  and few studies have investigated the combination of DLD and bilingualism in relation
  to EF., AIMS: This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on children's
  EF development., METHODS: Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical
  development (TD; N = 32 in each group) were tested three times with yearly intervals
  (MAGE = 71 months at time 1). Verbal and visuospatial working memory, selective
  attention, and inhibition were assessed., RESULTS: Monolinguals and bilinguals with
  DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to
  TD peers, which could partly be explained by verbal short-term memory limitations.
  Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and
  morphology skills, and were most pronounced at time 1., CONCLUSIONS: Monolinguals
  and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits, which are partly
  secondary to verbal short-term memory weaknesses. Bilinguals performed better on
  EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for. This effect
  was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 5-6 years. Copyright Â©
