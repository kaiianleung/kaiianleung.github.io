abstract: Numerous publications demonstrate the importance of community-based participatory
  research (CBPR) in community health research, but few target the Deaf community.
  The Deaf community is understudied and underrepresented in health research despite
  suspected health disparities and communication barriers. The goal of this paper
  is to share the lessons learned from the implementation of CBPR in an understudied
  community of Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users in the greater Rochester, New
  York, area. We review the process of CBPR in a Deaf ASL community and identify the
  lessons learned. Key CBPR lessons include the importance of engaging and educating
  the community about research, ensuring that research benefits the community, using
  peer-based recruitment strategies, and sustaining community partnerships. These
  lessons informed subsequent research activities. This report focuses on the use
  of CBPR principles in a Deaf ASL population; lessons learned can be applied to research
  with other challenging-to-reach populations.
