 abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Asians (Asian Indians and Pakistanis) are the second fastest growing ethnic group in the United States (US) and have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to other populations. Although lifestyle interventions have shown effectiveness at reducing ASCVD risk in non-Hispanic Whites, evidence suggests that program reach has been limited in South Asian populations. Over 90 % of US South Asians are immigrants, and there is often a mismatch between the conceptual underpinning of most lifestyle interventions and South Asians' social and cultural context. Through a community-academic partnership, we pilot-tested a culturally-salient, community-based healthy lifestyle intervention and compared it with print health education materials to reduce ASCVD risk factors in a medically underserved South Asian immigrant community. METHOD(S): South Asians in Chicago, 30-59 years, were recruited through a community organization that provides social services to medically underserved South Asians. Participants received community-based screening, and those with at least one ASCVD risk factor (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or overweight/obesity) were randomized into the South Asian Heart Lifestyle Intervention (SAHELI) study and followed for 6 months. The SAHELI intervention group (n=31) attended 6 interactive group sessions that incorporated the deep (values, beliefs, explanatory models) and surface (language) structures of South Asian culture. Classes were led by trained, multilingual health educators and focused on simple health messages, skills-building and self-monitoring related to increasing physical activity, eating a healthful diet, portion control, and stress management and coping. Intervention participants also received biweekly support using motivational interviewing via telephone. The control group (n=32) received translated print education materials containing standard clinical information about ASCVD risk factors and healthy behaviors. Both groups were referred to primary care providers. Outcomes, including weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, health behaviors, knowledge, coping, and exercise confidence were measured at baseline and 3, and 6 months. RESULT(S): Participants' average age was 50 (SD+/-8) years, 63% were female, 46% had less than or equal to a high school education, one-third were limited English proficient, and two-thirds had no health insurance. At baseline, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2 (SD+/-4.9), hemoglobin A1c 6.3 (SD +/-1.2), total cholesterol 185 (SD+/-32), and systolic blood pressure 129 (SD+/-17). Compared to the control group, the SAHELI intervention group lost significantly more weight (-3.2 lb, p-value=0.04) and had a greater sex-adjusted decrease in hemoglobin A1c (-0.43 %, p-value \textless0.01) at 6 months. Changes in blood pressure and cholesterol did not differ between the treatment groups. We also observed a significant increase in both intervention and control groups' knowledge and coping. CONCLUSION(S): A lifestyle intervention incorporating the socio-cultural context of underserved South Asian immigrants and delivered in a community setting was more effective at improving ASCVD risk factors than print health education materials. Analyses of accelerometer and 24-hour dietary recall data are underway. A future study will evaluate the long-term effect of SAHELI in a larger sample of US South Asians.},
