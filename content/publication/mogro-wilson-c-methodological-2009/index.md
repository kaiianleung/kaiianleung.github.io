abstract: Much of the research on the causes of minority health disparities has focused
  on populations in large cities. Yet, the growth of the Latino population in rural
  areas in the United States often results in isolation of these communities, fewer
  resources, and invisible barriers that lead to health disparities. Specifically,
  substance use is of growing concern in many rural Latino communities. To help eliminate
  health disparities, treatment must be provided by well-trained, qualified, and culturally
  competent health professionals. This article reviews the relevant literature that
  highlights health disparity issues, and discusses ways to reduce, and eventually
  eliminate, minority health inequities by building on and strengthening the community
  partners' ability to collaborate on intervention programs. The challenges of collaborating
  with trained bilingual clinicians along with issues of mental health promotion in
  rural Latino communities are identified.
