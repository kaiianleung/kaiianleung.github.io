 abstract = {Much of the research on the causes of minority health disparities has focused on populations in large cities. Yet, the growth of the Latino population in rural areas in the United States often results in isolation of these communities, fewer resources, and invisible barriers that lead to health disparities. Specifically, substance use is of growing concern in many rural Latino communities. To help eliminate health disparities, treatment must be provided by well-trained, qualified, and culturally competent health professionals. This article reviews the relevant literature that highlights health disparity issues, and discusses ways to reduce, and eventually eliminate, minority health inequities by building on and strengthening the community partners' ability to collaborate on intervention programs. The challenges of collaborating with trained bilingual clinicians along with issues of mental health promotion in rural Latino communities are identified.},
