abstract: 'Objective: There is an increasing demand for tertiary pain services, with
  long waiting times compounded by limited reach to regional and remote areas. Community-based
  pain programs are a feasible evidence-based model of care to improve access to multidisciplinary
  care. Australian primary health networks (PHNs) are well placed to commission pain
  programs to reduce the growing burden of chronic pain. The aim of this study was
  to support PHN decision-making by: (1) describing current PHN community-based pain
  programs; (2) assessing their alignment to key elements and implementation enablers
  of pain programs identified by an expert consensus process; and (3) describing PHN
  pain program adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): PHN program managers
  of community-based pain programs (n = 9) were invited to participate in an online
  survey and follow-up email consultation about their pain program. Six PHN program
  managers (representing South Eastern NSW PHN, Nepean Blue Mountains PHN, North Western
  Melbourne PHN, Gold Coast PHN, Adelaide PHN and the WA Primary Health Alliance)
  participated in the study with three PHNs commissioning two different types of pain
  programs. Result(s): PHN community-based pain programs are multidisciplinary programs
  underpinned by a biopsychosocial model of pain, and focus on self-management (e.g.
  exercise, psychological strategies) and pain education. Most PHN pain programs are
  group-based programs that target adults with chronic non-cancer pain, provide individual
  allied health referrals as required and are evaluated as part of the electronic
  Persistent Pain Outcomes Collaboration. Gaps include pain programs for Aboriginal
  and Torres Strait Islander people, and people from culturally and linguistically
  diverse backgrounds, with one notable exception of a PHN pain program for people
  from culturally and linguistically diverse and refugee backgrounds co-designed with
  consumers and relevant services. Programs targeting subacute pain to prevent progression
  to chronic pain are, with one exception, another gap area. PHN pain programs demonstrated
  a high level of alignment with expert-agreed key elements and implementation enablers.
  The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the rapid adaptation of PHN pain programs using
  available methods for the delivery of digitally enabled care. Conclusion(s): The
  findings provide a greater understanding for researchers and PHN decision-makers
  of the key features of PHN community-based pain programs, their alignment with expert-agreed
  key elements and implementation enablers, the target-population gaps, and the types
  of program adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also illustrate
  the potential for using digitally enabled delivery methods to increase accessibility
  to pain programs with further research warranted.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s)
