abstract: About 450 languages are spoken in Nigeria with Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba as
  the major languages. In order to assign functional roles to the multiplicity of
  languages, the Federal Government promulgated the National Policy on Education (henceforth
  NPE) in 1977 stipulated that every Nigerian child must be proficient in his mother
  tongue and in a major Nigerian language. At the secondary level, it is expected
  that every child should be bilingual in two Nigerian languages. Thirty six years
  later, the impact of the policy on the language education of Nigerian pupils was
  assessed. Data were collected using questionnaire and interview methods. Findings
  revealed that the primary aim of the NPE has not been achieved. Based on the findings,
  the recommendation made include the organization of intensive workshop sessions
  for language teachers to expose them to the modern techniques for attaining bilingualism
  through effective training.
