abstract: The pilot study reported in this article culturally and linguistically adapted
  an educational intervention to promote cancer clinical trials (CCTs) participation
  among Latinas/os and African Americans. The single-session slide presentation with
  embedded videos, originally developed through a campus-community partnership in
  Southern California, was chosen for adaptation because it was perceived to fit the
  CORRECT model of innovation (credible, observable, relevant, relatively advantageous,
  easy to understand, compatible, and testable) and because of the potential to customize
  any components not identified as core, allowing them to be revised for cultural
  and linguistic alignment in New York City. Most of the 143 community participants
  (76.2%) were female; most (54.6%) were older than 59 years. More than half (78.3%)
  preferred to speak English or were bilingual in English and Spanish. A large proportion
  (41.3%) had not completed high school. Knowledge and perceived benefits and barriers
  regarding CCT showed small, though statistically significant, increases. There were
  no statistically significant group differences for changes in mean knowledge, perceived
  benefits, or perceived barriers when examined by ethnicity, education level, language,
  or other included sociodemographic variables. However, a small, but statistically
  significant difference in perceived barriers was observed when examined by country
  of origin, with the foreign born score worsening 0.08 points (SD = 0.47, p = .007)
  on the 5-point Likert-type scale administered posteducation compared to preeducation.
  Participants' open-ended comments demonstrated the acceptability of the topic and
  intervention. This adaptation resulted in an intervention with the potential to
  educate African American and Latina/o general community members in a new geographic
  region about the purpose, methods, and benefits of CCTs. Copyright Â© 2015 Society
