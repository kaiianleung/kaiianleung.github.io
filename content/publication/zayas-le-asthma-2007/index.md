abstract: Disenfranchised ethnic minority communities in the urban United States experience
  a high burden of asthma. Conventional office-based patient education often is insufficient
  to promote proper asthma management and coping practices responsive to minority
  patients' environments. This paper explores existing and alternative asthma information
  and education sources in three urban minority communities in western New York State
  to help design other practical educational interventions. Four focus groups (n =
  59) and four town hall meetings (n = 109) were conducted in one Hispanic and two
  black communities. Focus groups included adult asthmatics or caretakers of asthmatics,
  and town meetings were open to all residents. A critical theory perspective informed
  the study. Asthma information and education sources, perceptions of asthma and ways
  of coping were elicited through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis followed
  a theory-driven immersion-crystallization approach. Several asthma education and
  information resources from the health care system, media, public institutions and
  communities were identified. Intervention recommendations highlighted asthma workshops
  that recognize participants as teachers and learners, offer social support, promote
  advocacy, are culturally appropriate and community-based and include health care
  professionals. Community-based, group health education couched on people's experiences
  and societal conditions offers unique opportunities for patient asthma care empowerment
  in minority urban communities. Â© The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University
