 abstract = {Background: There is evidence that low socio-economic status (SES) of mothers correlates with later language and social communication outcomes of their children. This longitudinal project aims to determine whether individual differences in eye movement patterns at 6-7 months of age can predict language and social communication outcomes at 2 years of age. An eye-tracker was set up in Children's Centres in two East London boroughs with high socio-economic deprivation, where early language and social difficulties are highly prevalent. Method(s): Data collected from almost 200 babies will indicate which eye-tracking tasks, showing dynamic social stimuli, can become reliable early screening tools for babies at risk for later difficulties with language and social communication. The sample of infants was very varied in terms of SES, ethnicity, and spoken languages (e.g., over 40 different languages were spoken as first language). Result(s): We will show results of the Pop-out study, which investigated whether a face preference is elicited in 6-7 month-olds by presenting faces in a complex visual array also containing pictures of other (in)animate objects. Specific individual differences between infants related to family SES, language background, level of caregiver education, and/or housing and childcare arrangements will be discussed. Discussion(s): Despite competing objects, infants have a clear preference for the face, both in terms of overall looking time and first saccade. However, there were also large individual differences in terms of both measures between infants. The correlation between these individual differences and SES measures will be discussed.},
