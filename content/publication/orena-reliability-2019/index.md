abstract: 'Purpose: This study examined the utility of the Language ENvironment Analysis
  (LENA) recording system for investigating the language input to bilingual infants.Method:
  Twenty-one French-English bilingual families with a 10-month-old infant participated
  in this study. Using the LENA recording system, each family contributed three full
  days of recordings within a one-month period. A portion of these recordings (945
  minutes) were manually transcribed, and the word counts from these transcriptions
  were compared against the LENA-generated adult word counts.Results: Data analyses
  reveal that the LENA algorithms were reliable in counting words in both Canadian
  English and Canadian French, even when both languages are present in the same recording.
  While the LENA system tended to underestimate the amount of speech in the recordings,
  there was a strong correlation between the LENA-generated and human transcribed
  adult word counts for each language. Importantly, this relationship holds when accounting
  for different-gendered and different-accented speech.Conclusions: The LENA recording
  system is a reliable tool for estimating word counts, even for bilingual input.
  Special considerations and limitations for using the LENA recording system in a
  bilingual population are discussed. These results open up possibilities for investigating
  caregiver talk to bilingual infants in more detail.'
