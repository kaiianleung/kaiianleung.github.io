abstract: Depression frequently negatively affects patient overall self-care and social
  stress management within United States safety net care systems. Rates of major depression
  are significantly high among low-income predominantly Hispanic/Latino with chronic
  illness, such as diabetes and heart disease. The study design of the A Helping Hand
  to Activate Patient-Centered Depression Care among Low-income Patients (AHH) randomized
  clinical trial aims to enhance patient depression care receipt and overall bio-psychosocial
  self-care management. The AHH trial is conducted in collaboration with three Los
  Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) safety net clinics that provide
  Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) care. The study compares AHH intervention (AHH)
  in which community-based bilingual promotoras provide in-person or telephone patient
  engagement and intervention aimed to reduce the burden and strain on patients, families,
  and care providers by assessing, enhancing, and facilitating patient depression
  and co-morbid illness self-care management skill, and activating patient communication
  with clinic medical providers versus DHS PCMH team usual care (PCMHUC). AHH independent
  bilingual recruiters screened 1957 and enrolled 348 predominantly Hispanic/Latino
  patients, of whom 296 (85%) had diabetes, 14 (4%) with heart disease, and 38 (11%)
  with both diseases. Recruiters identified depressed patients by baseline Patient
  Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 10 or more, completed baseline assessments, and
  randomized patients to either AHH or PCMHUC study group. The comprehensive assessments
  will be repeated at 6 and 12 months by an independent bilingual follow-up interviewer.
  Baseline and outcome data include mental health assessment and treatment receipt,
  co-morbid illness self-care, social relationships, and environmental stressor assessments.Copyright
