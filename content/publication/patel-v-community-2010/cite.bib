 abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION: Immigrant communities in the United States have significant barriers to accessing health care and thereby contributing to health disparities. At the same time, groups working to address such disparities inimmigrant communities need to be community responsive but have significant challenges in gathering information to guide interventions. Traditional community based health surveys, usually conducted by departments of health and via telephone, can be problematicwhen gathering information about immigrants since such communities may be "hidden" due to language, logistical, and trust issues. Here we describe a unique process of training communitymembers to become health promoters and laying the groundwork to conduct a community based health needs assessment of a hard to reach community in New York City. Learning Objective 1: To develop a community based needs assessment using community health promoters. Learning Objective 2: Learning Objective 3: Description of Program/Intervention: We formed an academiccommunity partnership, the Westchester Square Partnership to address the health and social needs of the rapidly growing Bangladeshi immigrant community in theBronx.We initially conducted English as Second Language classes at a community health center in a neighborhood where a high percentage of Bangladeshi immigrants reside. Through the English classes, we identified and recruited individuals to become community health promoters (CHP). CHPs underwent weekly training sessions for at least 12 weeks. As part of the training,CHPsconducted a communitymapping project to identify apartment buildings occupied by Bangladeshi residents in the Parkchester and Westchester square neighborhoods of the Bronx (where a large majority of Bangladeshi immigrants in the Bronx reside). CHPs then conducted several rounds of visits to the apartment buildings to introduce Westchester Square Partnership to the community and build trust. Two health fairswere also held in the community to create awareness of programs offered by theWestchester Square Partnership and clinical services available at the community health center. CHPs then conducted a door-to-door health needs assessment utilizing a questionnaire adapted from a New York City Department of Health community health survey which had been tested and validated in several languages among many different immigrant groups. FINDINGS TO DATE: Thus far, seven community health promoters have been trained. 76 participants are enrolled in English as second language classes and 26 to 35 women participate in a weekly new mothers' support group. 14 out of 16 women are continuing to participate in a community based participatory research initiative. The response rate for the health needs assessment was 88% 158 out of 180 households approached participated in the survey KEY LESSONS LEARNED: This program demonstrates a successful academic-community partnership using community health promoters to access and conduct ahealth needs assessment of a hard to reach immigrant.},
