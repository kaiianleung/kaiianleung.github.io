abstract: "The Genesee County Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH)
  program is a community-based program designed to reduce African American infant
  mortality rates in Flint, Michigan. Genesee County REACH activities address three
  core themes: fostering community mobilization, reducing racism, and enhancing the
  maternal-infant health care system. The REACH Community Action Plan was generated
  using a community-based participatory approach, and is based on a socio-ecological
  model with interventions focused at the individual, organizational, health system,
  and community levels. Genesee County REACH's Community Windshield Tours were developed
  to raise awareness of social and environmental barriers to health promotion among
  health care system staff in Flint, Michigan. These tours provide a close-up examination
  of the community's environmental conditions and the experiences of mothers, children,
  and families at risk for poor birth outcomes. In this article, we report our findings
  from pre-/post-tour surveys, as well as long-term follow-up surveys, to assess the
  impact of this REACH activity on participants' knowledge and beliefs about Genesee
  County residents, and to determine any resultant individual, policy, system, or
  environmental changes. We used t tests to compare participants' responses before
  and after the tours. We found that several individual- and systems-level changes
  have resulted from these tours, reflecting greater cultural sensitivity and increased
  understanding of patients' circumstances. African American infant mortality rates
  in Genesee County declined to a historic low in 2005, and they remain lower than
  in previous years. Although REACH coalition partners recognize that this reduction
  cannot be attributed to a single intervention or activity, REACH activities such
  as the Community Windshield Tours addressing multiple levels of the socio-ecological
  model may have had a synergistic effect."
