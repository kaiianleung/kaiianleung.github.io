abstract: "The influence of unhealthy food environments on residents' eating behaviors
  has been previously documented. Yet, socioeconomic differences across areas are
  less studied. Participatory studies provide relevant knowledge to better inform
  future nutrition interventions. We conducted a participatory Photovoice project
  in which residents interpreted the influence of the local food environment on eating
  behaviors across three neighborhoods of contrasting area-level socioeconomic status
  (SES) in Bilbao, Spain. From April to July 2017, a total of 23 residents participated
  in the three Photovoice groups. Each group critically discussed their photographs
  (N = 110) in groups of 6-9 participants along six group sessions. Through a consensus-building
  process, participants identified 27 emerging categories choosing finally 39 related
  photographs, which followed six conceptual main themes characterizing their local
  food environment: 1) unhealthy eating behaviors, 2) cultural diversity, 3) retail
  transformation, 4) social relationships, 5) precariousness, and 6) healthy eating.
  Although high food quality and fresh products may portray a general healthy food
  environment in all three neighborhoods, participants discussed why some residents
  still adopt unhealthy eating behaviors characterized by an excessive consumption
  of alcohol (high-SES area), sugar loaded foods (high- and middle-SES) and fast food
  (middle and low-SES). This photovoice participatory methodology helps highlighting
  important similarities and differences regarding food environment perceptions in
  the whole socioeconomic spectrum of any given city. This type of participatory approach
  helps guiding local policies and interventions promoting healthier local food environments."
