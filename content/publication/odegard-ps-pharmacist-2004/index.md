abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To improve asthma treatment outcomes in Asians living in Seattle
  and for whom English is a second language. DESIGN: Pre-post design. SETTING: International
  Community Health Services, Seattle, Washington. PATIENTS: Asians older than 18 years
  with asthma and whose native language was not English. INTERVENTION: Pharmacists
  or pharmacy students provided oral and written asthma education in the subject's
  native language. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported use of valve-holding chambers
  and peak flow meters; self-reported asthma symptoms at baseline and 6 months after
  intervention; number of acute asthma-related (non-routine, non-follow-up) clinic
  visits during the 6 months before and after the intervention. RESULT(S): Thirty-two
  subjects, aged 42 to 88 years, participated. Subjects demonstrated a reduction in
  mean number of asthma attacks (3.7 to 1.0, P textless .001) and night awakenings
  (1.4 to 0.3, P textless .001). Patient satisfaction with the program was excellent.
  Spacer and peak flow meter use increased from 7 to 18 subjects (P textless .001)
  and 1 to 14 subjects (P textless .0002), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Language-appropriate
  asthma education improved treatment outcome for patients whose native language was
  not English."
