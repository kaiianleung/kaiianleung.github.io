abstract: Previous studies found that bilingual children and adults with typical language
  development (TLD) perform better than monolinguals in novel word learning, but show
  lower scores on lexical retrieval tasks (e.g., naming known words). Children with
  developmental language disorder (DLD) lack in their abilities in both tasks compared
  with children with TLD. The current study tested the interplay between bilingualism
  and language disorder during novel word learning and lexical retrieval. Preschoolers
  (N = 101; 50 boys and 51 girls; mothers' mean years of education = 16.35) in four
  groups (Hebrew monolinguals or Russian-Hebrew bilinguals with DLD or TLD) learned
  12 novel real words (6 with a familiar referent and 6 with a novel referent) and
  performed a lexical retrieval task. Children exhibited significant learning with
  no effect of bilingualism, but a negative effect of language disorder. Thus, children
  with DLD performed worse than children with TLD, and this ability was not affected
  by bilingualism. In lexical retrieval, DLD groups scored lower than TLD groups,
  and critically also bilinguals scored lower than monolinguals. This differential
  effect of bilingualism in the two tasks suggests that bilingualism does not impede
  language learning mechanisms even among children with DLD. Instead, the findings
  suggest that lower performance in the lexical retrieval task is due to decreased
  frequency of exposure. By exploring both word learning and lexical retrieval, the
  study highlights the differential mechanisms at play in the effects of bilingualism
  and language disorder on the developing lexicon. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022
