 abstract = {Introduction: This mixed methods study describes processes to actively engage underserved, immigrant, and refugee communities in COVID-19 vaccine efforts to co-create culturally relevant resources and dissemination., Methods: A survey on health care characteristics and COVID-19 attitudes was deployed between March-November 2021 followed by listening sessions conducted in December 2021. All participants were recruited through the project's Community Advisory Board. The survey, completed by 77 adults, was available in English, Spanish, Burmese, Kizigua, and Karen. Listening sessions were led by trained, multilingual, and multicultural interviewers., Results: Doctors/healthcare providers were rated as the most trusted messengers of COVID-19 information, however, trusted sources varied across communities. Data from three listening sessions (with a total of 14 participants) expanded survey findings with a focus on trusted sources of COVID-19 communication., Conclusions: This study confirmed the importance of healthcare professionals as trusted messengers for COVID-19 information among underserved communities. Qualitative data highlighted the importance of schools, ethnically-based community organizations, and friends/family with health and English literacy skills for immigrant and refugee communities. Findings suggest opportunities for collaboration with specific trusted sources for future public health dissemination efforts., Trial registration: not applicable. Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).
