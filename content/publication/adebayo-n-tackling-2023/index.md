abstract: Racial health disparities continue to greatly impact the incidence and mortality
  rates of gynecologic cancers. Although there are many drivers for these disparities,
  limited inclusion of vulnerable populations in clinical research and narrowed medical
  knowledge of patients are large contributors that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic
  communities. To mitigate these disparities, we must look for avenues that connect
  patients from these communities to cancer researchers. In this review, we summarize
  2 projects that can serve as models for future interventions that promote education
  and engagement in clinical research for populations most impacted by gynecologic
  cancer disparities.Copyright Â© 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.
