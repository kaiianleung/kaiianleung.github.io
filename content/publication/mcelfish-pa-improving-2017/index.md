abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The United States continues to become more racially and ethnically
  diverse, and racial/ethnic minority communities encounter sociocultural barriers
  to quality health care, including implicit racial/ethnic bias among health care
  providers. In response, health care organizations are developing and implementing
  cultural competency curricula. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR)
  approach, we developed and evaluated a cultural competency training program to improve
  the delivery of culturally appropriate care in Marshallese and Hispanic communities.,
  METHODS: We used a mixed-methods evaluation approach based on the Kirkpatrick model
  of training evaluation. We collected quantitative evaluation data immediately after
  each training session (March 19, 2015-November 30, 2016) and qualitative data about
  implementation at 2 points: immediately after each session and 6 months after training.
  Individuals and organizational units provided qualitative data., RESULTS: We delivered
  1,250 units of in-person training at 25 organizations. Participants reported high
  levels of changes in knowledge (91.2%), competence (86.6%), and performance (87.2%)
  as a result of the cultural competency training. Organizations reported making policy
  and environmental changes., CONCLUSION: Initial outcomes demonstrate the value of
  developing and implementing cultural competency training programs using a CBPR approach.
  Additional research is needed to determine the effect on long-term patient outcomes.'
