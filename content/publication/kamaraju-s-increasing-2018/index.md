abstract: 'Introduction: Milwaukee, a city characterized by high rates of racial segregation
  and a growing immigrant population, has large race-based breast cancer survival
  disparities. To address these disparities, breast health education workshops were
  offered through a community-academic partnership (CAP) to women from various ethnic
  backgrounds. This paper explores attendance, satisfaction, and rates of screening
  mammography among workshop attendees. Method(s): Partnerships were formed with community-based
  organizations, a mobile mammography unit, and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program,
  a state-supported program providing free mammograms. Multilingual staff provided
  monthly breast health education workshops at community settings and coordinated
  transportation. Participants completed surveys that included demographics, prior
  screening history, barriers to screening, and program evaluation. Descriptive statistics
  were used to summarize and analyze data. Result(s): Over a 24-month period, 493
  women-most of whom sought services at partnering organizations that serve primarily
  immigrants, refugees, and racial minorities-attended breast health workshops, with
  374 participants completing surveys (mean age = 45 years). A total of 360 were textgreater=
  40 years old. Among these women, 188 (113 insured [60%], 75 uninsured [40%]) reported
  no prior mammogram in the past 2 to 5 years. After attending the workshop, mammogram
  uptake was 100% among the insured and 80% among the uninsured. Satisfaction with
  the workshops was high; 73% of attendees rated them highly informative. Conclusion(s):
  Our CAP offered culturally tailored breast health education and access to screening
  via a mobile unit that was well attended, highly rated, and increased screening
