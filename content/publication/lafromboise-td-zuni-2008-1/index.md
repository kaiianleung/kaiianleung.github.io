abstract: The Zuni Life Skills Development Program, an effective community-initiated
  and high-school-based suicide prevention intervention, is featured. Development
  and evaluation of this intervention are followed by note of the specific challenges
  associated with stabilizing the program. A more tribally diverse, culturally-informed
  model entitled the American Indian Life Skills Development Curriculum is then presented
  to illustrate a hybrid approach to the cultural tailoring of interventions. This
  curriculum is broad enough to address concerns across diverse American Indian tribal
  groups yet respectful of distinctive and heterogeneous cultural beliefs and practices.
  Finally, we reflect upon issues in community-based research that emerged during
  this collaboration.
