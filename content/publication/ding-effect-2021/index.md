abstract: Low socioeconomic status (SES) may generally have a long-lasting negative
  effect on cognitive development, and show deficits in the development of executive
  functions. However, it is unclear whether there is an SES-dependent disparity in
  the functional brain development of the prefrontal cortex. By collecting task-related
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and behavioral data (e.g., intelligence,
  language, home reading environment (HRE), family income, and parental education
  level), the current study aimed to detect whether the SES of preschool children
  (N = 86) is associated with prefrontal activation during the joint attention task.
  Results verified that low-SES children show lower right prefrontal activation during
  joint attention than Relatively High-SES children. In addition, our findings confirmed
  the mediating effect of HRE on the association between SES and brain activation
  during joint attention, as well as that between SES and language ability. These
  results suggest that SES contributes to functional development of the prefrontal
  regions, and the improvement of HRE could be a potential strategy to intervene SES-related
  disparities on child development. Copyright Â© 2021 Ding, Li, Li, Wang and Yu.
