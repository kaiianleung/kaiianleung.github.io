abstract: 'Clinic-based studies suggest that dementia is diagnosed at older ages in
  bilinguals compared with monolinguals. The current study sought to test this hypothesis
  in a large, prospective, community- based study of initially nondemented Hispanic
  immigrants living in a Spanish-speaking enclave of northern Manhattan. Method(s):
  Participants included 1,067 participants in the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood
  Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were tested in Spanish and followed at 18-24
  month intervals for up to 23 years. Spanish-English bilingualism was estimated via
  both self-report and an objective measure of English reading level. Multilevel models
  for change estimated the independent effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline
  in 4 domains: episodic memory, language, executive function, and speed. Over the
  course of the study, 282 participants developed dementia. Cox regression was used
  to estimate the independent effect of bilingualism on dementia conversion. Covariates
  included country of origin, gender, education, time spent in the United States,
  recruitment cohort, and age at enrollment. Result(s): Independent of the covariates,
  bilingualism was associated with better memory and executive function at baseline.
  However, bilingualism was not independently associated with rates of cognitive decline
  or dementia conversion. Results were similar whether bilingualism was measured via
  self-report or an objective test of reading level. Conclusion(s): This study does
  not support a protective effect of bilingualism on age-related cognitive decline
  or the development of dementia. In this sample of Hispanic immigrants, bilingualism
  is related to higher initial scores on cognitive tests and higher educational attainment
  and may not represent a unique source of cognitive reserve. Â© 2013 American Psychological
