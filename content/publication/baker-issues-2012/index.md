abstract: There is a growing demand for utilizing evidence-based approaches to increase
  physical activity. While systematic reviews have recommended strategies, researchers
  have cautioned that these strategies must be adapted to fit the needs of specific
  populations and the community context. The purpose of our work was to use a community-based
  participatory research approach to identify issues to consider when adapting evidence-based
  physical activity interventions with and within racial/ethnic minority communities.
  Concept mapping was used to enable members of racial/ethnic minority communities
  who were engaged in prevention research to identify issues to consider when adapting
  physical activity recommendations for use with and within racial and ethnic minority
  communities. Concept mapping resulted in ten issues to consider when adapting physical
  activity interventions. Areas of similarity and difference in how these issues were
  ranked among racial/ethnic groups were reviewed. The issues to consider when adapting
  evidence-based physical activity interventions with and within racial/ethnic minority
  communities were similar to those discussed in previous literature; however, the
  operationalization of many of these issues was seen as unique.
