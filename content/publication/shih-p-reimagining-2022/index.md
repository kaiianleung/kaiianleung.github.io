abstract: "BACKGROUND: Reflections on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic often
  evoke the concept of 'resilience' to describe the way health systems adjusted and
  adapted their functions to withstand the disturbance of a crisis, and in some cases,
  improve and transform in its wake. Drawing from this, this study focuses on the
  role of consumer representatives in healthcare services in initiating changes to
  the way they participated in the pandemic response in the state of New South Wales
  in Australia. METHOD(S): In-depth interviews were conducted with two cohorts of
  consumer representatives. Cohort A included experienced and self-identified consumer
  leaders, who worked together in a COVID-19 Consumer Leaders Taskforce; Cohort B
  included participants outside of this group, and purposively included consumer representatives
  from rural and regional areas, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.
  RESULT(S): The pause in consumer engagement to support health service decision-making
  in responding to the pandemic forced consumer representatives to consider alternative
  approaches to participate. Some initiated networking with each other, forming new
  collaborations to produce consumer-led research and guidelines on pandemic-related
  patient care. Others mobilized support from community and politicians to lobby for
  specific healthcare issues in their local areas. CONCLUSION(S): The response to
  the COVID-19 pandemic made visible the brittle nature of previous engagement processes
  of involving consumers in organizational design and governance. However, the momentum
  for proactive self-organization in an unexpected crisis created space for consumer
  representatives to reset and reimagine their role as active partners in health services.
  Their ability to adapt and adjust ways of working are key assets for a resilient
  health system. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This project is a collaborative study
  between academic researchers and health consumer (patient and public) representatives.
  It followed the principles of codesign and coresearch, whereby both consumer representatives
  and academic researchers contributed equally to all stages of the project. The study
  was cofunded by both academic institutions and consumer representative organizations.Copyright
