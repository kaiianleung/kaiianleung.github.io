abstract: Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, and institutional
  death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase
  access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based
  models to meet the ever-growing need in a culturally sensitive and congruent manner.
  Patient navigator interventions are community-based, culturally tailored models
  of care that have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early
  diagnosis, and treatment. We have developed a patient navigation intervention to
  improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill Latinos. We describe the protocol
  for a National Institute of Nursing Research-funded randomized controlled trial
  designed to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention.
  We aim to enroll 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness from
  both urban and rural clinical sites. Participants will be randomized to the intervention
  group (five palliative care patient navigator visits plus bilingual educational
  materials) or control group (usual care plus bilingual educational materials). Outcomes
  include quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), advance
  care planning (Advance Care Planning Engagement survey), pain (Brief Pain Inventory),
  symptom management (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised), hospice utilization,
  and cost and utilization of healthcare resources. This culturally tailored, evidence-based,
  theory-driven, innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential
  to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate health equity in palliative
  and end-of-life care.Copyright Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
