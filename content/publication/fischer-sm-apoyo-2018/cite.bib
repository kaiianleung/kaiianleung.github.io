 abstract = {Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, and institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever-growing need in a culturally sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community-based, culturally tailored models of care that have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment. We have developed a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill Latinos. We describe the protocol for a National Institute of Nursing Research-funded randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention. We aim to enroll 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness from both urban and rural clinical sites. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group (five palliative care patient navigator visits plus bilingual educational materials) or control group (usual care plus bilingual educational materials). Outcomes include quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), advance care planning (Advance Care Planning Engagement survey), pain (Brief Pain Inventory), symptom management (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised), hospice utilization, and cost and utilization of healthcare resources. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory-driven, innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate health equity in palliative and end-of-life care.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
