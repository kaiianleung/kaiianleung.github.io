 abstract = {Despite growing interest in the community-based participatory research method, limited empirical research exists on how to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers in applying community-based participatory research principles within the Chinese elderly community. This article reports on the implementation of a participatory process to assess the health needs of an aging Chinese population. We recorded challenges faced and lessons learned in collecting pilot data on issues pertaining to the health of a community-dwelling older Chinese population (over 60 years of age) in Chicago's Chinatown (Chicago, IL, USA). We have learned that establishing partnerships with a humble approach, acknowledging community diversity in languages and cultures, building on community strengths, and empowering community through education are important considerations in this collaboration. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. Â© 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.},
