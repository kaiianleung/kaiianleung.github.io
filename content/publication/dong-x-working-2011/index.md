abstract: Despite growing interest in the community-based participatory research method,
  limited empirical research exists on how to overcome cultural and linguistic barriers
  in applying community-based participatory research principles within the Chinese
  elderly community. This article reports on the implementation of a participatory
  process to assess the health needs of an aging Chinese population. We recorded challenges
  faced and lessons learned in collecting pilot data on issues pertaining to the health
  of a community-dwelling older Chinese population (over 60 years of age) in Chicago's
  Chinatown (Chicago, IL, USA). We have learned that establishing partnerships with
  a humble approach, acknowledging community diversity in languages and cultures,
  building on community strengths, and empowering community through education are
  important considerations in this collaboration. Implications of these findings for
  research and practice are discussed. Â© 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.
