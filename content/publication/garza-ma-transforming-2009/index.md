abstract: "BACKGROUND: Underserved populations are underrepresented in public health
  initiatives such as tobacco control and in cancer clinical trials. Community involvement
  is crucial to interventions aimed at reducing health disparities, and local health
  departments increasingly are called upon to provide both leadership and funding.
  The Tacoma Pierce County Health Department (TPCHD), in conjunction with 13 key community-based
  organizations and healthcare systems, formed the Cross Cultural Collaborative of
  Pierce County (CCC) that successfully employs needs-assessment and evaluation techniques
  to identify community health initiatives. METHODS: Community leaders from six underserved
  populations of the CCC were trained in needs-assessments techniques. Assessments
  measured effectiveness of the collaborative process and community health initiatives
  by using key informant (n = 18) and group interviews (n = 3). RESULTS: The CCC,
  facilitated by its partnership with the TPCHD, built capacity and competence across
  community groups to successfully obtain two funded public health initiatives for
  six priority populations. Members expressed overall satisfaction with the training,
  organizational structure, and leadership. The CCC's diversity, cultural competency,
  and sharing of resources were viewed both as a strength and a decision-making challenge.
  CONCLUSION: Public health department leadership, collaboration, and evidence-based
  assessment and evaluation were key to demonstrating effectiveness of the interventions,
  ensuring the CCC's sustainability."
