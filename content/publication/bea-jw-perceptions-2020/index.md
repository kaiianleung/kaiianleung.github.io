abstract: 'Native Americans experience cancer-related health disparities. Yet, little
  is known about the current cancer experience in one of the largest Native American
  tribe, Navajo. A qualitative study of among Navajo cancer survivors, in which focus
  groups and individual interviews included questions related to perceptions of cancer
  causes, prevention, and treatment, allowed us to evaluate several aspects of the
  cancer experience from the Navajo perspective. An experienced, bilingual facilitator
  led the discussions using a standardized guide. Discussions were audio-recorded,
  documented by field notes, translated, as needed, and transcribed. NVivo software
  was used to summarize major themes according to the PEN-3 and health belief models.
  Navajo cancer survivors (N=32) were both males (n=13) and females (n=19) that had
  been previously diagnosed with a variety of cancers: colorectal, breast, ovarian,
  cervical, esophageal, gall bladder, stomach, prostate, kidney, and hematologic.
  Many survivors had accurate knowledge of risk factors for cancer. Barriers to screening
  and clinical care included language, expense, geography, fear, lack of information,
  skepticism related to Western medicine, and treatment side effects. While some survivors
  experienced familial support, others were isolated from the family and community
  due to the perspective of cancer as a contagion. However, resilience, hope, trust
  in select community organizations, a desire to restore balance, and to support younger
  generations were positive attributes expressed regarding the treatment and recovery
  process. These evaluations need to be replicated across a larger cross-section of
  the Native cancer survivor community.'
