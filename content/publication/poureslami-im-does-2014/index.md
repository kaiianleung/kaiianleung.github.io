abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To explore cultural context for smoking cessation within Chinese
  communities in Vancouver, and identify opportunities to support development of culturally
  appropriate resources for cessation., METHODS: Applied participatory approach involving
  community members, patients, and key-informants in the design and implementation
  of the research., RESULTS: Whereas many participants were motivated to quit, their
  perceptions of desire to do so were not supported by effective interventions and
  many attempts to quit were unsuccessful., CONCLUSION: Tobacco control clinics and
  care providers need to adopt culturally and linguistically relevant interventions
  to facilitate behavioral modifications and cessation in ethnic minority communities.'
