abstract: 'Objective: The current study examined how the opposing effects of bilingualism
  and attention problems operate on executive functioning, visual processing, and
  verbal fluency in children with clinically significant levels of attention problems.
  Method: We tested whether bilingualism moderated associations between attention
  problems and visual processing, executive functioning, and verbal fluency. Results:
  Bilingual children (n = 331) showed visual processing advantages relative to their
  monolingual peers (n = 165), but only at higher, and not lower, levels of attention
  problems. Bilingualism did not moderate the association between attention problems
  and interference control; however, across all children, those with higher levels
  of attention problems had more difficulty with interference control. Monolingual
  children demonstrated advantages in verbal fluency relative to bilingual children,
  but this did not vary with attention problems. Conclusion:  Visual processing advantages
  in bilinguals are detected among children with heightened attention problems, but
  advantages in interference control are not; findings may have implications for classroom
  interventions.'
