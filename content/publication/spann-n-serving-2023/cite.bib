 abstract = {As pharmacy professionals and health care systems serve diverse patient populations, especially in continued efforts to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019, racial and ethnic disparities must be acknowledged and addressed. The authors share a collaboration between a nonprofit immunization coalition and college of pharmacy to provide mobile coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination clinics to communities across Idaho that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The goal of this commentary is to share experiences providing vaccination services for the Hispanic community and discuss strategies for pharmacy professionals to provide more equitable care. Through clinical experience and listening sessions to address vaccine hesitancy, several themes emerged that could be categorized into the following: convenience, complacency, and confidence. Suggestions to overcome vaccine hesitancy include hosting events at work sites, bilingual communication techniques, targeted education, and collaboration with trusted community partners. Additional considerations in implementing more equitable care include creating a culturally competent workforce, combatting vaccine misinformation, and finding sustainable ways to continue community partnerships to provide ongoing and expanding services. Utilizing unique approaches to serve the stated needs of a Hispanic population is essential to providing equitable health care to all members of a community.Copyright © 2022},
