 abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Despite growing awareness of the benefits of physical activity for older people, some population subgroups remain particularly hard to engage, especially those with English as a second language (ESL) and frail older people. METHOD(S): A qualitative investigation of an existing community-based physical activity provider - Active Involved Mature (AIM)--was undertaken, including in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 key partners and nine class instructors, and focus groups with 58 class participants. RESULT(S): Health benefits and social factors were strong incentives for participation among both ESL and frail groups. Some differences were evident between these two groups in their needs and strategies reported as addressing these needs. Partners described AIM as a quality service with a commitment to working with groups in need, responsive to the local community and with a good track record of collaborative work. Specific strategies targeted engagement and long-term participation. CONCLUSION(S): Social and environmental strategies, in addition to cognitive and behavioural approaches, supported participation of ESL and frail older people in AIM's group-based physical activity classes. Development of community and organisational partnerships, targeting to group needs (for ESL groups) and tailoring to individual requirements (for frail participants) were also seen as key features for success. These program elements are supported by, and grounded in, current health promotion and behavioural theory.},
