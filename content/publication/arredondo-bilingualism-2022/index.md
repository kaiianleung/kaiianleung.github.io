abstract: A bilingual environment is associated with changes in the brain's structure
  and function. Some suggest that bilingualism also improves higher-cognitive functions
  in infants as young as 6-months, yet whether this effect is associated with changes
  in the infant brain remains unknown. In the present study, we measured brain activity
  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in monolingual- and bilingual-raised
  6- and 10-month-old infants. Infants completed an orienting attention task, in which
  a cue was presented prior to an object appearing on the same (Valid) or opposite
  (Invalid) side of a display. Task performance did not differ between the groups
  but neural activity did. At 6-months, both groups showed greater activity for Valid
  (textgreater Invalid) trials in frontal regions (left hemisphere for bilinguals,
  right hemisphere for monolinguals). At 10-months, bilinguals showed greater activity
  for Invalid (textgreater Valid) trials in bilateral frontal regions, while monolinguals
  showed greater brain activity for Valid (textgreater Invalid) trials in left frontal
  regions. Bilinguals' brain activity trended with their parents' reporting of dual-language
  mixing when speaking to their child. These findings are the first to indicate how
  early (dual) language experience can alter the cortical organization underlying
  broader, non-linguistic cognitive functions during the first year of life. Copyright
