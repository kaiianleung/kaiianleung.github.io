 abstract = {An intersectoral immigrant health promotion project in Hamilton, Ontario is described. The project goal was to facilitate the entry of new immigrants to the Ontario health care system and equip them with knowledge and skills to strengthen their preventive and promotive health practices. A needs assessment preceded project development. The three phases of the project are described. The first phase commenced with the development of culturally sensitive health promotion resource materials to be used with immigrants enrolled in English as a Second Language Classes. In phase two, activities focussed on strengthening the ability of ESL teachers to incorporate a preventive and promotive health focus in their classes. The final phase shifted to a community based project. During this phase, a core immigrant group developed their skills as health advocates for their immigrant community.},
