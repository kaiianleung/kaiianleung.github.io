abstract: "Background: Bilingual families with children with autism often struggle
  with the dilemma of language choice for their children as they are usually advised
  by professionals to use only one language to avoid the risk of language delay and
  confusion. However, there is no scientific base to such advice. Aim(s): To investigate
  how bilingualism would affect children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the
  aspect of executive functions (EF) and social and communication competence. Method
  & Procedure: A total of 67 participants were separated into four groups according
  to their language use (bilingual/monolingual) and their developmental status (TD/ASD).
  Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the accuracy and latency of EF tasks and the score
  of questionnaires on social and communication competence. Outcomes & Results: Bilingual
  ASD children did not perform worse than monolingual ASD children. No significant
  differences were found between groups except between TD and ASD in the Japanese
  version of Stroop task and the scores of the social and communication competence
  questionnaires. Significant difference was found between the bilingual ASD and the
  Japanese monolingual ASD at the latency of the English version of Stroop task but
  stroop effect was not significantly different. Conclusions & Implications: In addition
  to no extra delay in language development, this study suggests that being bilingual
  for children with ASD does not impede their EF and social and communication competence.
  Professionals should consider the family cultural background and language use before
  suggesting the 'one language only' advice as it can scar the family dynamics and
  deprive the child's opportunity to be fully involved in the family.Copyright Â© 2017
