 abstract = {This study seeks the unique perspective of Latin American- trained nurses on barriers and strategies to improve the health of Baltimore's Latino community. Individual in-depth interviews are conducted in Spanish with one male and seven female nurses recruited by Baltimore's Latino Providers Network. Audiotaped home interview transcripts are manually reviewed for common themes. Strategies include professional medical interpreters, workshops on the U.S. health care system, media campaign on affordable/bilingual care sources, licensing foreign-trained nurses, and outreach clinics linked to trusted community-based organizations. Findings can be used to develop culturally appropriate programs to better administer health care to Latino communities. Â© 2008 Sage Publications.},
