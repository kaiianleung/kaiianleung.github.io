 abstract = {The systematic review describes aims to synthesize the HIV prevention intervention-related research conducted among adult, US sexual minority Hispanic men since 2012. Following PRISMA guidelines, 15 articles representing 14 studies were included in the review: 4 randomized controlled trials, 5 pilots, and 5 formative projects. Two interventions had PrEP-related outcomes whereas 7 focused on behavioral (e.g., condoms, testing) and/or educational outcomes. Few studies used digital health. All but one study was theoretically guided. Community engagement was a common and important thread in the included studies, with community-based participatory research being the most prevalent framework. The inclusion of cultural factors varied widely, as did the availability of Spanish language or bilingual study materials. Future research opportunities are discussed and recommendations to bolster HIV prevention interventions (e.g., tailoring) are presented. These include the need for greater integration of cultural factors (e.g., nuances related to the heterogeneity of Hispanic subgroups) and mitigating critical barriers to help improve uptake of evidence-based strategies in this population.Copyright Â© 2023.
