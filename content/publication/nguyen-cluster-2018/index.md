abstract: "Background: Resources for Enhancing All Caregivers Health in the Department
  of Veterans Affairs (REACH VA) is an evidence-based intervention supporting family
  dementia caregivers that has been shown to improve caregiver outcomes for culturally
  diverse populations in the United States. However, this model has not been tested
  in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Vietnam, where community-based
  psychosocial interventions are urgently needed. The objectives of this study are
  to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a culturally adapted
  version of the Resources for Enhancing All Caregivers Health in Vietnam (REACH VN).Methods:
  A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted over a 6-month period
  in Soc Son district located in Hanoi. An expected sample of 10 to 12 communes, representing
  approximately 50 dementia primary caregivers, will be randomized to either the REACH
  VN intervention or an enhanced control condition. Inclusion criteria for the caregiver
  include age ≥18, family member who provides the most day-to-day care for person
  with dementia, and a total score for the brief (4 item) Zarit Burden Scale of ≥6.
  Over the course of 2 to 3 months, each participant in the intervention group will
  receive the REACH VN intervention comprised of 4 core sessions on problem solving,
  mood management/cognitive restructuring, stress management, and communication, and
  up to 2 additional sessions based on caregiver's needs. The enhanced control group
  will receive a single session that provides verbal and written information on dementia.
  Caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline (i.e., time of enrolment) and 3
  months. The feasibility will be assessed with regard to recruitment, retention,
  treatment adherence, treatment fidelity, and assessment processes. For preliminary
  effectiveness, we will examine caregiver burden as the primary outcome and changes
  in caregiver depressive symptoms and in Alzheimer disease knowledge as secondary
  outcomes.Discussion: This is the first study to test community-based family dementia
  caregiver intervention in Vietnam. Results from this study will provide the foundation
  for a larger effectiveness trial and broader dissemination in Vietnam and may help
  inform efforts to develop similar community-based family dementia caregiver support
  programs in other LMICs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03587974.
