 abstract = {Bilingual children are becoming a majority worldwide, and this is true both for neurotypical children, children with Developmental Language Disorders (DLD), and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who are at the center of Prévost and Tuller’s (henceforth P&T) article. In bilingual development, we consider the impact of bilingual exposure variables on the development of each language. We further explore crosslinguistic influence, that is, the influence of the two languages on each other and how the same bilingual exposure variables impact crosslinguistic influence. For neurotypical children, bilingual variables such as age of onset of bilingualism (AOB) and length of exposure (LOE) were found to have a major impact on linguistic outcomes in both languages (for an overview see Armon-Lotem & Meir, 2019; Unsworth, 2014). Yet, as pointed out by P&T, less is known for bilingual children with DLD and even less for children with ASD. This is of a special interest as we can only measure the exposure but not the intake, that is, not what children do with the input they receive. The cases mentioned in P & T of learning a second language in the absence of communication, on the one hand, and of Arabic speaking children with ASD using the standard rather than the spoken variety, further highlight this dissociation between input and intake, and eventually output. We address this challenge, and bring evidence for the differential impact of exposure for children with DLD and ASD when compared with what we know for neurotypical children. And as is expected for bilingual children, we shall address both languages to see if different patterns are observed for each language.},
