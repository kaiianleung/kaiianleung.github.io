abstract: Previous findings show executive functioning advantages associated with
  dual language learning (DLL) among neurotypical individuals, yet few studies have
  investigated these effects in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present
  study investigated effects of DLL and socioeconomic status (SES) on parent-reported
  executive functioning, verbal ability, and social-emotional functioning using a
  sample of DLL (n = 53) and monolingual (n = 106) youth with ASD without intellectual
  disability, matched on gender and full-scale IQ scores. After controlling for the
  effects of SES, results showed that monolingual youth had better outcomes on verbal
  ability, while DLL youth had fewer parent-reported problems with executive functioning
  and unusual behaviors. These findings indicate that bilingualism may mitigate executive
  functioning deficits in youth with ASD. Copyright Â© 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive
