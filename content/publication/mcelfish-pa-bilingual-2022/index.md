abstract: "COVID-19 disparities exposed health inequity across socioeconomic status,
  with community members of color experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 infections,
  hospitalizations, and death. Racial/ethnic differences were especially disparate
  in Benton and Washington counties in northwest Arkansas, a region in the United
  States that experienced high COVID-19 infection rates. To address these disparities
  and support families with COVID-19, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
  and Community Clinic (a federally qualified health center) worked with the Arkansas
  Department of Health and community partners to develop systematic Care Navigation
  and Enhanced Case Management. During an initial screening process, contact tracers
  offered Care Navigation and Enhanced Case Management services to individuals who
  tested positive for COVID-19 within Washington and Benton counties. Bilingual community
  health navigators, social workers, and nurses began providing enhanced case management
  to households that accepted services. Between September 9, 2020 and June 19, 2021,
  3,502 households representing ~13,000 individuals were offered services, and 1,511
  (43.1%) households requested/accepted services. Based on our experience, we provide
  four recommendations for practice: (a) provide contact tracing in community members'
  preferred language, (b) incorporate assessments into the contact tracing process
  to ensure community members have necessary resources for quarantine, (c) implement
  comprehensive care navigation and case management services for those who need additional
  support, and (d) integrate bilingual health navigators who are part of the target
  community into the process. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."
