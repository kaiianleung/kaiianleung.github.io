abstract: Community-academic partnerships are vital to address cancer disparities
  in geographic areas with diverse socioeconomic, language, and cultural barriers.
  Regarding breast health, immigrant and refugee women are a particularly vulnerable
  population, with considerably lower mammography rates than most communities, including
  racial and ethnic minorities. To promote health care equity in this high-risk population,
  we developed a community-academic partnership (CAP) model to promote breast health
  education at community faith-based centers in the city of Milwaukee, WI. In this
  paper, we describe the success of our partnerships, our lessons learned, and future
  directions.
