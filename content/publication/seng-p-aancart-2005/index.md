abstract: "Census data indicate that Cambodian Americans are economically disadvantaged
  and linguistically isolated. In addition, cancer registry data show that Southeast
  Asians experience several cancer-related health disparities (e.g., markedly elevated
  risks of cervical and liver cancer). The Seattle regional Asian American Network
  for Cancer, Awareness, Research, and Training (AANCART) site has implemented a community-based
  cancer awareness program for Cambodian immigrants in collaboration with a Cambodian
  community coalition. Our cancer awareness program has the following goals: to assist
  individuals and organizations in advocating for a healthy community, to provide
  information within a cultural context, and to deliver information in ways that are
  useful and meaningful to the community. The program was guided by a community assessment
  that included the use of published data as well as information from qualitative
  interviews, focus groups, and quantitative surveys. Examples of community awareness
  activities include group presentations at community-based organizations (e.g., during
  English as a second language classes), health fair participation (including at nontraditional
  venues such as a farmers' market serving Cambodians), and educational displays in
  neighborhood locations (e.g., at Cambodian video stores). In addition, the Seattle
  AANCART site has both inventoried and developed culturally appropriate Khmer language
  cancer education materials and disseminated materials through the ETHNOMED website.
  Our approach recognizes that limited English language proficiency may preclude many
  Cambodians from understanding publicly disseminated information, and Cambodian immigrants
  are often isolated and tend to stay close to their own neighborhoods. Â© 2005 American
