abstract: The clinical assessment of language impairment (LI) in bilingual children
  imposes challenges for speech-language pathology services. Assessment tools standardized
  for monolingual populations increase the risk of misinterpreting bilingualism as
  LI. This Perspective article summarizes recent studies on the assessment of bilingual
  LI and presents new results on including non-linguistic measures of executive functions
  in the diagnostic assessment. Executive functions shows clinical utility as less
  subjected to language use and exposure than linguistic measures. A possible bilingual
  advantage, and consequences for speech-language pathology practices and future research
  are discussed.
