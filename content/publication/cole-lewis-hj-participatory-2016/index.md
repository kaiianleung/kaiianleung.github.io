abstract: 'Objective: To develop an expandable knowledge base of reusable knowledge
  related to self-management of diabetes that can be used as a foundation for patient-centric
  decision support tools. Material(s) and Method(s): The structure and components
  of the knowledge base were created in participatory design with academic diabetes
  educators using knowledge acquisition methods. The knowledge base was validated
  using scenario-based approach with practicing diabetes educators and individuals
  with diabetes recruited from Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving economically
  disadvantaged communities and ethnic minorities in New York. Result(s): The knowledge
  base includes eight glycemic control problems, over 150 behaviors known to contribute
  to these problems coupled with contextual explanations, and over 200 specific action-oriented
  self-management goals for correcting problematic behaviors, with corresponding motivational
  messages. The validation of the knowledge base suggested high level of completeness
  and accuracy, and identified improvements in cultural appropriateness. These were
  addressed in new iterations of the knowledge base. Discussion(s): The resulting
  knowledge base is theoretically grounded, incorporates practical and evidence-based
  knowledge used by diabetes educators in practice settings, and allows for personally
  meaningful choices by individuals with diabetes. Participatory design approach helped
  researchers to capture implicit knowledge of practicing diabetes educators and make
  it explicit and reusable. Conclusion(s): The knowledge base proposed here is an
  important step towards development of new generation patient-centric decision support
  tools for facilitating chronic disease self-management. While this knowledge base
  specifically targets diabetes, its overall structure and composition can be generalized
  to other chronic conditions.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.'
