abstract: 'The intersecting identities of those identifying with multiple minorities,
  such as 2SLGBTQ+and ethnolinguistic minorities, bring individuals to have unique
  experiences, especially concerning health and wellness. This topic is particularly
  poorly understood among French-speaking official language minority 2SLGBTQ+populations
  in Canada. Hence, this study was conducted to generate insights into their needs
  and experiences, through the lens of intersectionality. This quantitative community-based
  study, a first of its kind in Western Canada, describes the sociodemographic profile,
  experiences of discrimination and stigmatisation, and needs and challenges pertaining
  to mental health and social supports of this double minority group. Data were obtained
  by an online survey conducted in the Canadian province of Manitoba in June 2020.
  The participant sample was largely homogenous: most were under the age of 55years,
  white, educated, and from urban areas. Many reported experiencing dual marginalisation,
  feeling unaccepted by both of their minority communities (Francophone and 2SLGBTQ+).
  A sense of isolation, as well as a lack of social connectedness and psychological
  support, were often reported. Social initiatives and mental health support within
  environments proactively affirming of the official language of the minority and
  inclusive of diverse 2SLGBTQ+identities are needed.'
