abstract: Although researchers generally agree that a certain set of brain areas underlie
  bilingual language processing, there is discrepancy regarding what effect timing
  of language acquisition has on these regions. We aimed to investigate the neuroanatomical
  correlates of age of acquisition (AoA), which has been examined previously, but
  with inconsistent results, likely influenced by methodological differences across
  studies. We analyzed gray matter density, volume, and thickness using whole-brain
  linear models in 334 bilinguals and monolinguals. Neuroanatomical correlates of
  AoA differed depending on gray matter metric. Relative to early bilinguals, late
  bilinguals had thicker cortex in language processing and cognitive control regions,
  and greater density in multiple frontal areas and the right middle temporal and
  supramarginal gyri. Early bilinguals had greater volume than late bilinguals in
  the left middle temporal gyrus. Overall, volume was the least sensitive to AoA-related
  differences. Multiple regions not classically implicated in dual-language processing
  were also found, which highlights the important role of whole-brain analyses in
  neuroscience. This is the first study to investigate AoA and gray matter thickness,
  volume, and density all in the same sample. We conclude that cognitive models of
  bilingualism should consider the roles of development and neuroanatomical metric
  in driving our understanding of bilingual and monolingual language organization.
