abstract: 'Event-related potentials (ERPs) in the processing of grammatical violations
  typically investigate differences between natives and second language speakers by
  averaging the amplitude of a participant’s brain response in a pre-specified time
  window by condition. This approach suffers from the problem that time windows are
  defined arbitrarily, and that the result is sensitive to outliers as well as participant
  variation in latency. The latter is particularly problematic for studies on L2 processing.
  The size of the ERP response (i.e., amplitude difference) of an L2 speaker may not
  be the best indicator of near-native proficiency, either, with the consistency of
  the response potentially being a more valid indicator. We introduce a set of individual
  difference measures based on complete ERP waveforms using generalized additive modelling
  (GAM), extracted based on amplitude, area and peak effects. We illustrate the benefits
  of our method compared to the traditional Response Magnitude Index with data on
  the processing of grammatical gender violations in 66 Slavic L2 speakers of German
  and 29 German native speakers. One of our measures in particular appears to outperform
  the others in characterizing differences between natives and L2 speakers, and captures
  proficiency differences between L2 speakers: the ‘Normalized Modelled Peak’, reflecting
  the height of the (modelled) peak, normalized against the uncertainty of the modelled
  signal. This measure reflects peak robustness, that is, how reliable a P600 effect
  is found, largely independently of its latency in the P600 window. We discuss implications
  of our results and offer suggestions for future studies on L2 processing.'
