abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Childhood obesity is rising among culturally and linguistically
  diverse (CALD) groups who show poor engagement in obesity prevention initiatives.
  We examined the barriers and facilitators to the engagement of CALD communities
  in obesity prevention initiatives., METHODS: We used the nominal group technique
  to collect data from 39 participants from Vietnamese, Burmese, African, Afghani
  and Indian origins living in disadvantaged areas of Victoria, Australia. Data analysis
  revealed ranked priorities for barriers and facilitators for CALD community engagement
  in obesity prevention initiatives., RESULTS: CALD parents identified key barriers
  as being: competing priorities in the post-migration settlement phase; language,
  cultural and program accessibility barriers; low levels of food and health literacy;
  junk food advertisement targeting children; and lack of mandatory weight checks
  for schoolchildren. Key facilitators emerged as: bicultural playgroup leaders; ethnic
  community groups; and school-based healthy lunch box initiatives., CONCLUSION: This
  study has identified several policy recommendations including: the implementation
  of robust food taxation policies; consistent control of food advertising targeting
  children; improving CALD health literacy using bicultural workers; and matching
  health promotional materials with CALD community literacy levels. Implications for
  Public Health: These recommendations can directly influence public health policy
  to improve the engagement of CALD communities in obesity prevention services and
  ultimately reduce the widening obesity disparities in Australia.Copyright Â© 2017
