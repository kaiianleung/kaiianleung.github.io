abstract: 'Introduction: Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death
  in the United States, and screening rates are disproportionately low among Latinos.
  In 2015, only 63% of eligible adults, and 50% of Latinos, were up to date with colon
  cancer screening recommendations. One factor thought to contribute to the low screening
  rate is that patientfacing health information for Latinos is difficult to understand
  and patients face challenges in taking appropriate health action. As part of the
  Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention (PROMPT) study that seeks
  to raise rates of colon cancer screening in a Latino-serving community health center
  in California, we used boot camp translation (BCT), a validated community-based
  participatory strategy, to elicit input from diverse stakeholders and refine the
  messages and format of colon cancer screening reminders for a clinic-based direct
  mail fecal immunochemical test (FIT) program. Method(s): We adapted BCT to engage
  Latino patients and clinic staff in this research. Eligible patient participants
  were Latino, aged 50 to 75 years, able to speak English or Spanish, and willing
  to participate in a 6-hour in-person meeting and three 30-minute follow-up phone
  calls. Materials were developed in English and Spanish, and separate sessions were
  held for English- and Spanish-speaking participants. As part of the in-person sessions,
  a national bilingual colon cancer expert delivered a presentation on colon health,
  cancer screening, and messages to improve screening participation, specific to Latino
  populations. Following the presentation, BCT experts facilitated brainstorming sessions
  to obtain feedback on the presented information, followed by an interactive small-group
  session where participants reviewed sample written materials and reminder messages
  using various modalities (e.g., text, letter, automated and live calls). We asked
  participants to consider what information about colon cancer screening is important
  to share with other patients, what the best methods are to share these messages,
  and the frequency with which these messages should be delivered to patients to encourage
  FIT completion. Participants then engaged in a hands-on exercise to share input
  about the timing and frequency of reminder delivery. Results from the exercise were
  used to define the intervention for the PROMPT pilot. Result(s): A total of 25 adults
  participated in an in-person session (12 in the English-language session; 13 in
  the Spanish-language session). Participants were mostly clinic patients (84%) and
  the majority were female (80%). Among the patient participants, 57% were enrolled
  in Medicaid, and 67% reported an annual household income of less than $20,000. Key
  themes from the sessions included increasing awareness about colon cancer and screening
  options, stressing the urgency of screening, and using personalized messages such
  as ?I? statements in letters or human voices on automated phone call reminders.
  Both sessions noted the importance of receiving an alert (automated or live) before
  the FIT kit is mailed, and of receiving a reminder within 2 weeks of FIT kit mailing.
  Conclusion(s): Our BCT process allowed English- and Spanish-speaking Latino patients
  to directly inform which approaches get tested in the pilot study by refining message
  content and selecting their modality and timing to encourage patients who are mailed
  a FIT to complete it and mail it back. Using BCT, we successfully incorporated participant
  feedback to design culturally relevant health messages to promote FIT testing among
  patients served by community clinics.'
