abstract: 'Introduction: Racial/ethnic minority communities are underrepresented in
  research. Medical mistrust and mistreatment, discrimination, and a lack of diverse
  research workforce may influence recruitment and engagement. Engaging Latinx immigrants
  for research presents unique recruitment challenges, especially for biobehavioral
  research which is not well explored. The purpose of this paper is to examine the
  effect of targeted strategies for recruiting young adult, Latinx immigrants. Method(s):
  Recruitment occurred from 2018 to 2019 in an ongoing, longitudinal, community-engaged
  research study examining risk and resilience factors for health outcomes in Latinx
  immigrants. Strategies included active recruitment (e.g., community-based events
  and public events) and passive recruitment (e.g., word-of-mouth and radio and flyer
  advertisements). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence
  of type of recruitment on participant enrollment. Result(s): The study enrolled
  391 participants of 701 interested individuals (55%). Greater odds of enrollment
  were among participants recruited through radio and flyer advertisements (adjusted
  odds ratio [AOR]=2.90, 95%CI [1.59, 5.27], p=.001), word-of-mouth (AOR=2.50, 95%
  CI [1.55, 4.03], ptextless.000), or community-based organization events (AOR=1.68,
  95% CI [1.19, 2.38], p=.003). Conclusion(s): Passive recruitment strategies through
  trusted sources increased the odds of enrollment of Latinx immigrants in biobehavioral
  research. Future recruitment efforts should leverage trusted sources to disseminate
  recruitment materials addressing barriers to recruiting Latinx participants for
  research.'
