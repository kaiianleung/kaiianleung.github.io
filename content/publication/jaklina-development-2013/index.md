abstract: Australia has a high number of people from culturally and linguistically
  diverse (CALD) backgrounds whose primary language is not English. CALD population
  groups have comparatively lower levels of education and health literacy, and poorer
  health outcomes compared with the Australian-born population. The delivery of consumer
  health information to people from CALD backgrounds usually includes the use of translated
  resources. Unfortunately, the quality of translated resources available on health
  issues is highly variable and may impact efforts to address the disparities in health
  outcomes. Currently applied guides to translation focus on accuracy and literalness
  of the translation; however, for health translations, conveying meaning and incorporating
  culturally relevant information is essential. Minimum standards for developing translated
  resources are needed to provide an indication of quality for end users, including
  healthcare providers, the client and carer. This paper describes the development
  of a Translation Standard, led by a community nursing organisation in collaboration
  and consultation with CALD community members and peak community organisations in
  Melbourne, Australia. The Translation Standard includes 10 components that have
  been identified as necessary to ensure a minimum standard of translation that is
  of high quality and caters to the health literacy levels of the target audience.
  What is known about the topic? There are many people from CALD backgrounds who have
  worse health outcomes than people who are Australian born. There is a gap in guidance
  to health professionals on how to develop high-quality translations of consumer
  health information that consider culture and health literacy. Higher-quality translations
  are needed to better inform CALD groups about their health. What does this paper
  add? The description of a new Translation Standard to guide the development of culturally
  relevant consumer health translations, considering the cultural needs and health
  literacy level of the target audience. What are the implications for practitioners?
  The Translation Standard provides assurance to practitioners that any translation
  that has followed this Standard is of high quality and increases the likelihood
  that the target audience will find the information relevant and understandable.
  The Translation Standard can assist consumers to make more informed choices and
  decisions about their health. Future translations would benefit by using such a
  guide.
