 abstract = {Introduction: Early monolingual versus bilingual experience affects linguistic and cognitive processes during the first months of life, as well as functional activation patterns. The previous study explored the influence of a bilingual environment in the first months of life on resting-state functional connectivity and reported no significant difference between language groups., Methods: To further explore the influence of a bilingual environment on brain development function, we used the resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy public dataset of the 4-month-old infant group in the sleep state (30 Spanish; 33 Basque; 36 bilingual). Wavelet Transform Coherence, graph theory, and Granger causality methods were performed on the functional connectivity of the frontal lobes., Results: The results showed that functional connectivity strength was significantly higher in the left hemisphere than that in the right hemisphere in both monolingual and bilingual groups. The graph theoretic analysis showed that the characteristic path length was significantly higher in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere for the bilingual infant group. Contrary to the monolingual infant group, the left-to-right direction of information flow was found in the frontal regions of the bilingual infant group in the effective connectivity analysis., Discussion: The results suggested that the left hemispheric lateralization of functional connectivity in frontal regions is more pronounced in the bilingual group compared to the monolingual group. Furthermore, effective connectivity analysis may be a useful method to investigate the resting-state brain networks of infants. Copyright © 2022 Gao, Shu and Li.},
