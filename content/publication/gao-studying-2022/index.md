abstract: 'Introduction: Early monolingual versus bilingual experience affects linguistic
  and cognitive processes during the first months of life, as well as functional activation
  patterns. The previous study explored the influence of a bilingual environment in
  the first months of life on resting-state functional connectivity and reported no
  significant difference between language groups., Methods: To further explore the
  influence of a bilingual environment on brain development function, we used the
  resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy public dataset of the 4-month-old
  infant group in the sleep state (30 Spanish; 33 Basque; 36 bilingual). Wavelet Transform
  Coherence, graph theory, and Granger causality methods were performed on the functional
  connectivity of the frontal lobes., Results: The results showed that functional
  connectivity strength was significantly higher in the left hemisphere than that
  in the right hemisphere in both monolingual and bilingual groups. The graph theoretic
  analysis showed that the characteristic path length was significantly higher in
  the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere for the bilingual infant group.
  Contrary to the monolingual infant group, the left-to-right direction of information
  flow was found in the frontal regions of the bilingual infant group in the effective
  connectivity analysis., Discussion: The results suggested that the left hemispheric
  lateralization of functional connectivity in frontal regions is more pronounced
  in the bilingual group compared to the monolingual group. Furthermore, effective
  connectivity analysis may be a useful method to investigate the resting-state brain
  networks of infants. Copyright Â© 2022 Gao, Shu and Li.'
