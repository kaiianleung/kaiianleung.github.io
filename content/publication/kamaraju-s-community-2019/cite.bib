 abstract = {Community-academic partnerships are vital to address cancer disparities in geographic areas with diverse socioeconomic, language, and cultural barriers. Regarding breast health, immigrant and refugee women are a particularly vulnerable population, with considerably lower mammography rates than most communities, including racial and ethnic minorities. To promote health care equity in this high-risk population, we developed a community-academic partnership (CAP) model to promote breast health education at community faith-based centers in the city of Milwaukee, WI. In this paper, we describe the success of our partnerships, our lessons learned, and future directions.},
