abstract: "The Office of Minority Health (OMH) was established in December 1985 in
  response to recommendations developed by the Secretary's Task Force on Black and
  Minority Health. Originally, OMH's mission emphasized six health problems identified
  by the Task Force as priority areas: cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke;
  chemical dependency; diabetes; homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries; and
  infant mortality and low birth weight. OMH added HIV infection to the six health
  prioty areas after epidemiologic data showed that the representation of blacks and
  Hispanics was disproportionately high among persons reported with AIDS. Strategies
  to eliminate or reduce high-risk behaviors associated with HIV infection need to
  mobilize racial and ethnic minority communities and rebuild social networks in order
  to foster sustained behavioral changes. OMH created the Minority HIV Education/Prevention
  Grant Program to demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies to expand the activities
  of minority community-based and national organizations involved in HIV education
  and prevention, as well as to encourage innovative approaches to address appropriately
  the diversities within and among minority populations. In 1988, grants totalling
  $1.4 million were awarded to four national and 23 community-based minority organizations.
  Project workers conduct information, education, and prevention interventions directed
  to specific groups within racial and ethnic minority communities. Interventions
  include education and prevention training, information activities, developing educational
  materials, and providing technical assistance. Project innovations include conducting
  HIV education and prevention training for families at home, presenting a play produced
  and performed by local teenagers, and developing a workshop and a manual to help
  minority service organizations to recruit and train volunteer staff members. Working
  with minority community-based and national organizations is an essential component
  of effective strategies for preventing HIV infection among racial and ethnic minorities.
  OMH's Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program encourages minority groups
  to participate as partners in Federal, State, and local HIV prevention efforts."
