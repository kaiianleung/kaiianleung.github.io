abstract: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show heterogeneous language
  profiles beyond early language delays. Understanding the second language profiles
  of bilingual children with ASD is important for clinical practice in diverse societies.
  Accordingly, we examined the narrative abilities of bilinguals with ASD, with developmental
  language disorder (DLD), and with typical development (TD) to determine which narrative
  components best differentiate bilinguals with ASD from the other groups. Participants
  were 29 bilingual children with ASD, DLD, and TD who were matched for age (mean
  = 6;8), nonverbal intelligence, and receptive vocabulary. Narratives were coded
  for macrostructure (story grammar (SG) scores, number of individual SG components)
  and microstructure (syntactic complexity, mean length of utterance, lexical diversity,
  and story length). The TD group had superior SG scores, included more SG components,
  and used longer utterances and more complex syntax than the ASD group, whereas no
  differences were found between the clinical groups. For SG components requiring
  perspective-taking abilities, the ASD group had worse performance than the TD and
  DLD groups. Our results suggest that bilingual children with ASD show weaknesses
  in both macrostructure and microstructure, which can overlap with children with
  DLD. The linguistic profiles of bilingual children with ASD and DLD are thus both
  overlapping and distinct. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)
