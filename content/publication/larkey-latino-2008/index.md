abstract: Examples of cancer prevention and screening trials in the Southwest are
  reviewed as a platform for highlighting gaps in research on Latino recruitment.
  Three trials are described, using \"message/source/channel\" categories as a framework.
  Each trial engaged community members to facilitate recruitment and developed tailored
  strategies to meet challenges emerging after recruitment began. Although we affirm
  that culturally relevant messages, community member referral networks, and adjustment
  to community realities seem important to Latino recruitment, current anecdotal and
  research findings do not allow evidence-based recommendations to be made. We suggest
  a research agenda to further illuminate critical factors for successful Latino recruitment.
