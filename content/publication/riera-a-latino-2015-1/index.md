abstract: In this article, we analyze qualitative data from a purposeful sample of
  limited English proficiency (LEP) asthma health caregivers. We used ethnically concordant,
  semistructured, in-depth Spanish-language interviews and a follow-up focus group
  to explore issues related to communication during pediatric asthma encounters in
  medical settings. Inductive coding of Spanish transcripts by a bilingual research
  team was performed until thematic saturation was reached. Several key findings emerged.
  LEP caregivers encountered significant asthma burdens related to emotional stress,
  observed physical changes, and communication barriers. Language-discordant communication
  and the use of ad hoc interpreters were common. This finding is complex, and was
  influenced by perceptions of interpreter availability, delays in care, feelings
  of mistrust toward others, and individual emotional responses. Language-concordant
  education and suitable action plans were valued and desired. We discuss a revealing
  depiction of the LEP caregiver experience with asthma health communication and recommend
  areas for further inquiry. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2014.
