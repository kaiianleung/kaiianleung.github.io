abstract: The \"Know Hepatitis B\" campaign was the first national, multilingual communications
  campaign to promote testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) among Asian Americans and
  Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). This population comprises fewer than 5% of the total
  U.S. population but accounts for more than half of the up to 1.4 million Americans
  living with chronic HBV infection. To address this health disparity with a national
  campaign, CDC partnered with Hep B United, a national coalition of community-based
  partners working to educate AAPIs about hepatitis B and the need for testing. Guided
  by formative research, the \"Know Hepatitis B\" campaign was implemented in 2013
  with a twopronged communications strategy. CDC used available Chinese, Korean, and
  Vietnamese media outlets on a national level and relied on Hep B United to incorporate
  campaign materials into educational efforts at the local level. This partnership
  helped facilitate HBV testing among the priority population.
