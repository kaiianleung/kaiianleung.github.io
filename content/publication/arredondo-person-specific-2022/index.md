abstract: Bilingualism influences children's cognition, yet bilinguals vary greatly
  in their dual-language experiences. To uncover sources of variation in bilingual
  and monolingual brain function, the present study used standard analysis and innovative
  person-specific connectivity models combined with a data-driven grouping algorithm.
  Children (ages 7-9; N = 52) completed a visuo-spatial attention task while undergoing
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging. Both bilingual and monolingual
  groups performed similarly, and engaged bilateral frontal and parietal regions.
  However, bilinguals showed greater brain activity than monolinguals in left frontal
  and parietal regions. Connectivity models revealed two empirically-derived subgroups.
  One subgroup was composed of monolinguals and bilinguals who were more English dominant,
  and showed left frontal-parietal connections. The other was composed of bilinguals
  who were balanced in their dual-language abilities and showed left frontal lobe
  connections. The findings inform how individual variation in early language experiences
  influences children's emerging cortical networks for executive function, and reveal
  efficacy of data-driven approaches. Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
