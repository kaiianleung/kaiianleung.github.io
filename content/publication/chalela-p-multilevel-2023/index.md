abstract: "Background: Knowledge gained through cancer clinical trials (CTs) has been
  proven critical to preventing, diagnosing and treating the disease, and providing
  the evidence base for clinical practice. Major advances in cancer treatment, which
  are essential for improving patients' outcomes, come from investigations of new
  therapeutic agents in CTs. Despite the large number of available studies and improvements
  in public awareness about CTs, participation of underrepresented minorities in clinical
  research has been persistently low, with only 2 to 5% of Latinos and African Americans
  participating in cancer treatment trials. Barriers to participation are multilevel,
  complex, and multifactorial, including study design, healthcare system barriers,
  and patient-and medical team-related factors. Structural inequities, social determinants
  of health, distrust of government, patient-doctor communication, cultural and language
  barriers, and lower levels of health literacy have all been cited as common barriers
  for Latino and African American populations. Purpose(s): To improve informed decision-making
  about cancer CT participation among cancer patients and community members through
  a bilingual multilevel, multi-communication approach, including 1) a randomized
  controlled educational trial (clinic-based settings), and 2) a community education
  module (community-based settings). We will assess the impact of the intervention
  on awareness, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate
  treatment option for cancer and improve CT participation rates. Method(s): The clinical
  setting includes a 2-group, parallel, randomized study with 400 patients from the
  Mays Cancer Center. The intervention group receives 1) a bilingual educational video
  on CTs, 2) a low literacy booklet, 3) support from a patient navigator (PN), and
  4) an invitation to join our Salud America! network providing online/social media
  CT information. The control group receives a general fact sheet on CTs. All healthcare
  providers involved in clinical research will participate in Webinars to raise awareness
  of implicit bias and the importance of inclusive research. The community-setting
  intervention features a prospective singlegroup pre/post design, where participants
  (400) act as their own controls. They will receive an educational session on CTs
  provided by a community health educator + a low literacy booklet. Result(s): Focus
  groups guided the development of the video script, booklet, and educational materials.
  The short video features real cancer patients sharing their experience with CTs
  and how they overcame common barriers. Patient recruitment starts in August 2022.
  Preliminary results will be presented. Conclusion(s): Multilevel interventions involving
  culturally tailored decision aids (i.e., online video, low literacy booklet) in
  combination with care coordination by a PN can effectively address common barriers
  influencing patient decision-making regarding CTs, raise awareness, and increase
  positive attitudes and CT participation among specific groups with low participation
  in clinical research."
