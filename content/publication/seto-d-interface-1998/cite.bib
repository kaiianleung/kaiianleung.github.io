 abstract = {In a multicultural state such as Hawaii, there is an increasing awareness that understanding cultural diversity, particularly ethnicity as a form of culture, is important to the design and delivery of rehabilitation programs for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this paper, we will describe the ethnicity or culture of certain people with SCI and the causes of SCI in Hawaii, while keeping gender in mind. A discussion of three cultural considerations for outpatient services will follow: (1) provider self-awareness, (2) knowledge of the target ethnic/cultural population, and (3) knowledge, skills, and application of interventions. Finally, we will present a synopsis of a community-based project, the SCI Reunion, and its related cultural innovations. General implications on the interface of culture and rehabilitation will also be discussed.},
