abstract: 'In a multicultural state such as Hawaii, there is an increasing awareness
  that understanding cultural diversity, particularly ethnicity as a form of culture,
  is important to the design and delivery of rehabilitation programs for people with
  spinal cord injury (SCI). In this paper, we will describe the ethnicity or culture
  of certain people with SCI and the causes of SCI in Hawaii, while keeping gender
  in mind. A discussion of three cultural considerations for outpatient services will
  follow: (1) provider self-awareness, (2) knowledge of the target ethnic/cultural
  population, and (3) knowledge, skills, and application of interventions. Finally,
  we will present a synopsis of a community-based project, the SCI Reunion, and its
  related cultural innovations. General implications on the interface of culture and
  rehabilitation will also be discussed.'
