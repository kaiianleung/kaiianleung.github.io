abstract: "Objective: To assess how English language use by Hispanic women affects
  their preferences for participating in decision making and information seeking regarding
  medical care. Method(s): The study included 235 Hispanic women aged 35-61 years
  participating in a larger multicenter study, the Ethnicity, Needs, and Decisions
  of Women (ENDOW) Project. Participants were recruited from community settings and
  primary care public health clinics. Bilingual (English and Spanish speaking) interviewers
  asked participants questions about demographic characteristics, health status, reproductive
  history, menopausal status, access to healthcare, experience with hormone replacement
  therapy (HRT) and hysterectomy, outcome expectations about HRT and hysterectomy,
  medical decision making and social support. Using univariate and multivariate analyses,
  we assessed the relationships between the participants' preferences for participating
  in decision making and information seeking, their language use, and other covariates
  of interest. Result(s): Overall, the participants expressed a strong desire for
  information about and participating in medical decisions. However, they expressed
  a lower preference for participating in decisions related to use of HRT compared
  with the desire for engaging in decision involving invasive medical procedures (hysterectomy
  and cholecystectomy) and high blood pressure management. Increased use of English
  language was significantly associated with preferences for participating in medical
  care decision making, in general (p textless 0.001), and with information seeking
  (p = 0.044). Decreased use of English language was associated with a lower desire
  for participating in medical care decision making. Conclusion(s): Increased use
  of English language may influence Hispanic women's preferences for participating
  in medical decisions and their information-seeking behavior. Â© Mary Ann Liebert,
