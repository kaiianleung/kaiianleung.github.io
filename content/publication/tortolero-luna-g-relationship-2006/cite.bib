 abstract = {Objective: To assess how English language use by Hispanic women affects their preferences for participating in decision making and information seeking regarding medical care. Method(s): The study included 235 Hispanic women aged 35-61 years participating in a larger multicenter study, the Ethnicity, Needs, and Decisions of Women (ENDOW) Project. Participants were recruited from community settings and primary care public health clinics. Bilingual (English and Spanish speaking) interviewers asked participants questions about demographic characteristics, health status, reproductive history, menopausal status, access to healthcare, experience with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and hysterectomy, outcome expectations about HRT and hysterectomy, medical decision making and social support. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we assessed the relationships between the participants' preferences for participating in decision making and information seeking, their language use, and other covariates of interest. Result(s): Overall, the participants expressed a strong desire for information about and participating in medical decisions. However, they expressed a lower preference for participating in decisions related to use of HRT compared with the desire for engaging in decision involving invasive medical procedures (hysterectomy and cholecystectomy) and high blood pressure management. Increased use of English language was significantly associated with preferences for participating in medical care decision making, in general (p \textless 0.001), and with information seeking (p = 0.044). Decreased use of English language was associated with a lower desire for participating in medical care decision making. Conclusion(s): Increased use of English language may influence Hispanic women's preferences for participating in medical decisions and their information-seeking behavior. Â© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},
