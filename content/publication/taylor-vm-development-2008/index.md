abstract: 'Chinese immigrants to North America have substantially higher rates of
  chronic hepatitis B infection than the general population. One area for strategic
  development in the field of health education is the design and evaluation of English-as-a-Second
  language (ESL) curricula. The theoretical perspective of the Health Behavior Framework,
  results from a community-based survey of Chinese Canadian immigrants with limited
  English proficiency, and findings from focus groups of ESL instructors as well as
  Chinese ESL students were used to develop a hepatitis B ESL educational module.
  This research was conducted in Vancouver, BC. Survey data showed that less than
  three-fifths of the respondents had been tested for hepatitis B, and documented
  some important hepatitis B knowledge deficits. Further, only about one-quarter had
  ever received a physician recommendation for hepatitis B serologic testing. The
  ESL curriculum aims to both promote hepatitis B testing and improve knowledge, and
  includes seven different ESL exercises: Warm-up, vocabulary cards, information-gap,
  video, jigsaw, guided discussion, and problem/advice cards. Our quantitative and
  qualitative methods for curriculum development could be replicated for other health
  education topics and in other limited English speaking populations. Â© 2008 Springer
