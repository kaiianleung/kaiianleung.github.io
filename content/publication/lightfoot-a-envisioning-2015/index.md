abstract: "Purpose: North Carolina (NC) has experienced 943% growth in the Hispanic/Latino
  population over the last 20 years. Compared to whites in NC, Latinos face significant
  health care barriers, such as lack of insurance, access to care, and difficulty
  communicating with medical providers. Such barriers have potential lifelong implications
  for the health and well-being of Latino adolescents. Addressing implicit bias within
  patient-provider relationships may be one intervention point for reducing Latino
  health disparities. Our trans-disciplinary community-academic team developed and
  piloted an intervention, Envisioning Health, which used visual images (a photojournalism
  series documenting the migration journey of Latinos and adolescent-generated images
  through Photovoice) to engage pediatric residents in an exploration of Latino ethnicity
  and the experience of migration on health. Our objective was to make transparent
  to medical providers, the invisible impact of implicit bias on Latino adolescents'
  health. Method(s): We used the community-based participatory research (CBPR) method
  of Photovoice with groups of Latino adolescents from different communities. The
  adolescents took photos and engaged in the facilitated SHOWED/VENCER dialogue process
  (in English and Spanish) focusing on \\\"What I wish my doctor knew about my life.\\\
  \" They organized a forum with pediatric residents to discuss their Photovoice findings
  and prioritize next steps for enhancing equity in health care interactions and to
  improve the system of care. Result(s): Four themes emerged: 1) It's hard to develop
  a good relationship with doctors because teens can tell when doctors don't really
  care about our feelings, life, economic situation and besides that, the clinic switches
  our doctor each time we go; 2) Teens are very aware everyday of being judged, suspected,
  monitored, \\\"up to no good,\\\" and expected to fail by people in authority (teachers,
  MDs, police) - causing teens to avoid interacting with them as normal persons; 3)
  Because our parents are excluded from many systems, Latino teens are stressed by
  their conflicting realities of having to play the adult role and advocate for themselves
  in every arena, but adults don't listen to teens or accord the same respect or benefits
  as they would to other adults; 4) Having bilingual interpreters, or even native
  speakers serve as interpreters, doesn't necessarily make the communication problem
  go away because there is a difference between being bilingual and being bicultural.
  These findings engaged physicians and Latino adolescents in direct dialogue on how
  equity in quality of care is compromised by race-specific societal forces of migration
  and discrimination. Conclusion(s): Promoting authentic dialogue between Latino adolescents
  and physicians is an essential first step toward designing system change interventions
  to enhance equity in healthcare quality and outcomes."
