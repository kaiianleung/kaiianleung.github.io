abstract: In an era of global climate change, intertwined with social and ecological
  predation, there is growing recognition of the importance of building socially,
  environmentally, culturally pluralistic, just and sustainable futures. Yet many
  of the calls for reform and discourses around sustainability are authored and defined
  through top-down approaches, by those who have power, privilege, and cognitive authority,
  and excludes the voices, identities, and epistemologies of those in the margins.
  In this paper we argue for the need to design and develop transformative learning
  ecologies that explicitly position the diverse voices of youth from nondominant
  communities as central to re-defining and re-envisioning relationally just, pluralistic,
  and sustainable futures. To this end, we seek to provide examples from participatory
  design-based learning ecologies to illustrate the centering of middle school youth
  voices and agencies from multilingual Black, Brown, and Latinx communities through
  critical response-ability. These examples highlight how these youth grapple with
  the uncertain landscapes of sustainability in their communities and provide counter-narratives
  to traditional deficit-based discourses and youth empowerment. We draw on what we
  have learned from multilingual youth to offer some suggestions for designing transformative
  learning ecologies situated within the framework of critical-response-ability in
  the quest for sustainable, thriving, and just futures. Copyright Â© The Author(s),
