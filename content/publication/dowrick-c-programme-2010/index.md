abstract: 'Introduction: Mental health problems impose substantial burdens on patients
  and health care. A range of effective interventions exist, however many people with
  mental distress are disadvan-taged: either because they are unable to access care;
  or because access does not lead to adequate care. Our aims are to clarify mental
  health needs in under-served groups; and to develop, test and disseminate credible
  interventions. Method(s):AMPis a five year research programme based innorth-west
  England, involving people with mental health problems from eight under-served groups
  (minority ethnic communities, asylum-seekers, homeless, unemployed, adolescents,
  elders, people with advanced cancers or unexplained symptoms) and service providers.
  In our knowledge generation phase we combined systematic review and qualitative
  meta-synthesis of barriers to access and their solutions, with interviews with stakeholders
  from under-served groups and care providers. Result(s): Key emergent findings included
  concepts of silent suffering and embodied suffering, double stigma, the risks of
  engagement with services, and the cultural insensitivity of existing psychosocial
  interventions. We refined these findings through a formal consensus process, and
  have now developed innovative interventions in three inter-linked domains: community
  engagement, primary care development and sensitized psychosocial interventions.We
  are testing these interventions in terms of their acceptability and credibility
  to people from underserved groups, impact on mental health, and service implications.
  We will devise a focused implementation experiment in two primary care trusts, and
  disseminate our findings across primary health care. Conclusion(s): AMP has already
  achieved important new understanding of the mental health needs of under-served
  groups, and is now testing three innovative interventions.'
