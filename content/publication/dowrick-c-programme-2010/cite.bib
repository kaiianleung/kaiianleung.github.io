 abstract = {Introduction: Mental health problems impose substantial burdens on patients and health care. A range of effective interventions exist, however many people with mental distress are disadvan-taged: either because they are unable to access care; or because access does not lead to adequate care. Our aims are to clarify mental health needs in under-served groups; and to develop, test and disseminate credible interventions. Method(s):AMPis a five year research programme based innorth-west England, involving people with mental health problems from eight under-served groups (minority ethnic communities, asylum-seekers, homeless, unemployed, adolescents, elders, people with advanced cancers or unexplained symptoms) and service providers. In our knowledge generation phase we combined systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of barriers to access and their solutions, with interviews with stakeholders from under-served groups and care providers. Result(s): Key emergent findings included concepts of silent suffering and embodied suffering, double stigma, the risks of engagement with services, and the cultural insensitivity of existing psychosocial interventions. We refined these findings through a formal consensus process, and have now developed innovative interventions in three inter-linked domains: community engagement, primary care development and sensitized psychosocial interventions.We are testing these interventions in terms of their acceptability and credibility to people from underserved groups, impact on mental health, and service implications. We will devise a focused implementation experiment in two primary care trusts, and disseminate our findings across primary health care. Conclusion(s): AMP has already achieved important new understanding of the mental health needs of under-served groups, and is now testing three innovative interventions.},
