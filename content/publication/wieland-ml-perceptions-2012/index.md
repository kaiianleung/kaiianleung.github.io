abstract: English as a Second Language programs serve large foreign-born populations
  in the US with elevated risks of tuberculosis (TB), yet little is known about TB
  perceptions in these settings. Using a community-based participatory research approach,
  we elicited perceptions about TB among immigrant and refugee learners and staff
  at a diverse adult education center. Community partners were trained in focus groups
  moderation. Ten focus groups were conducted with 83 learners and staff. Multi-level,
  team-based qualitative analysis was conducted to develop themes that informed a
  model of TB perceptions among participants. Multiple challenges with TB control
  and prevention were identified. There were a variety of misperceptions about transmission
  of TB, and a lack of knowledge about latent TB. Feelings and perceptions related
  to TB included secrecy, shame, fear, and isolation. Barriers to TB testing include
  low awareness, lack of knowledge about latent TB, and the practical considerations
  of transportation, cost, and work schedule conflicts. Barriers to medication use
  include suspicion of generic medications and perceived side effects. We posit adult
  education centers with large immigrant and refugee populations as excellent venues
  for TB prevention, and propose several recommendations for conducting these programs.
  Content should dispel the most compelling misperceptions about TB transmission while
  clarifying the difference between active and latent disease. Learners should be
  educated about TB in the US and that it is curable. Finally, TB programs that include
  learners and staff in their design and implementation provide greater opportunity
  for overcoming previously unrecognized barriers.
