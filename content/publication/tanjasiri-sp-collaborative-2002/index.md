abstract: A fundamental component of community-based health promotion efforts to eliminate
  disparities is the mobilization of community involvement to address not only individual
  but also systemic and political causes of inequalities in health. The participatory
  action research (PAR) paradigm is well suited to address these multilevel inequalities
  in research and evaluation experienced by many ethnic and racial communities. In
  this article, a case study of a project to reduce health disparities in breast and
  cervical cancer among seven Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander communities in
  Southern California is presented. The authors applied a PAR framework to the process
  of needs assessment and program planning to understand and address the complex and
  multilevel factors that contribute to the problem of disparate breast and cervical
  cancer screening rates in these communities. Finally, the authors describe the lessons
  that were learned about how to promote collaborative research as an essential element
  in the design of projects and studies to address ethnic disparities in health outcomes
  for breast and cervical cancer.
