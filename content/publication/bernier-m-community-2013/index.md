abstract: "Background: Community Based Research (CBR) methodologies are now a well-established
  part of the Canadian HIV response. Key tenets of CBR include a focus on community
  input and on shared ownership. As such, the process of the research, much like the
  results, belongs equally to researchers and collaborators. Despite the wide recognition
  of these fundamental principles, challenges emerge when translating these principles
  into practice within national CBR projects where Francophone and Anglophone realities
  must be navigated. Objective(s): 1) To present challenges to collaborations in the
  context of national, community based, HIV research projects; 2) to further our understanding
  of common pitfalls drawing on two Quebec research coordinators' experiences from
  two ongoing CBR projects; the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health
  Cohort Study (CHIWOS) and the Food Security Study, both of which are conducted in
  Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia; 3) to elicit a critical reflection of CBR
  practices to improve further collaborations. Lessons Learned: Drawing lessons from
  both national CBR studies allowed us to observe similarities in challenges faced
  and successes achieved. These challenges included; 1) a tendency towards homogenization
  of methods and centralization of power and funds; 2) insufficient anticipation of
  cultural and linguistic differences; 3) insufficient resources dedicated to translation
  and cultural adaptation; 4) and disparities in allotting the burden of translation
  and related human resources. Successful strategies included: 1) establishing protocols
  for translation from project inception; 2) building these steps into study timelines;
  3) allotting sufficient central funds for translation; 4) promoting local autonomy
  and leadership; 5) and importantly, acknowledging that successfully navigating French
  and English realities is crucial to national CBR work. Recommendations : The expansive
  use of CBR strategies has meant the institutionalization and nationalization of
  participatory research strategies. However, in nationalizing CBR, new challenges
  have emerged. Experiences from the CHIWOS and the Food Security Project offer helpful
  lessons for future projects: in order to truly democratize research, we must also
  reinforce the capacity of local communities to change the face of HIV research in
  Canada."
