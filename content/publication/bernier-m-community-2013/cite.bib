 abstract = {Background: Community Based Research (CBR) methodologies are now a well-established part of the Canadian HIV response. Key tenets of CBR include a focus on community input and on shared ownership. As such, the process of the research, much like the results, belongs equally to researchers and collaborators. Despite the wide recognition of these fundamental principles, challenges emerge when translating these principles into practice within national CBR projects where Francophone and Anglophone realities must be navigated. Objective(s): 1) To present challenges to collaborations in the context of national, community based, HIV research projects; 2) to further our understanding of common pitfalls drawing on two Quebec research coordinators' experiences from two ongoing CBR projects; the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS) and the Food Security Study, both of which are conducted in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia; 3) to elicit a critical reflection of CBR practices to improve further collaborations. Lessons Learned: Drawing lessons from both national CBR studies allowed us to observe similarities in challenges faced and successes achieved. These challenges included; 1) a tendency towards homogenization of methods and centralization of power and funds; 2) insufficient anticipation of cultural and linguistic differences; 3) insufficient resources dedicated to translation and cultural adaptation; 4) and disparities in allotting the burden of translation and related human resources. Successful strategies included: 1) establishing protocols for translation from project inception; 2) building these steps into study timelines; 3) allotting sufficient central funds for translation; 4) promoting local autonomy and leadership; 5) and importantly, acknowledging that successfully navigating French and English realities is crucial to national CBR work. Recommendations : The expansive use of CBR strategies has meant the institutionalization and nationalization of participatory research strategies. However, in nationalizing CBR, new challenges have emerged. Experiences from the CHIWOS and the Food Security Project offer helpful lessons for future projects: in order to truly democratize research, we must also reinforce the capacity of local communities to change the face of HIV research in Canada.},
