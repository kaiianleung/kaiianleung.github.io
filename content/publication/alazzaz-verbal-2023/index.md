abstract: This study sheds light on the effect of bilingualism on working memory performance.
  It aims to investigate whether bilingual speakers have an advantage over monolingual
  speakers in performing visual-spatial working memory tasks. The present study attempts
  to be a contribution to the discussion of how working memory performance is affected
  by bilingualism. It tries to find out whether Arabic-English bilingual speakers
  have advantages over Arabic monolingual speakers in performing visual-spatial working
  memory tasks. Two experiments were conducted to test the working memory performance
  of bilinguals and monolinguals by using verbal and non-verbal tasks. The two measures
  were completed online; the non-verbal measure involved a picture memorization task,
  whereas the verbal measure involved word retrieval. Eighty female college students
  voluntarily participated in the study. Half were Arabic-English bilinguals, and
  the other half were Arabic monolinguals. Both groups were divided into two subgroups;
  half performed a non-verbal working memory task, and the other half participated
  in a verbal working memory task. The results showed no advantages for bilinguals
  in the picture memorization task. However, a bilingual advantage was found in the
  verbal working memory task in which bilingual speakers performed better in word
  retrieval compared to monolingual speakers. The findings indicate a positive effect
  of bilingualism on working memory performance, particularly in the visual-spatial
  component.
