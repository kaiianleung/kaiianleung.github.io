abstract: 'Working with linguistically isolated immigrants on public health issues
  poses a set of methodological challenges unique to this population. We used community-based
  participatory research (CBPR) techniques to investigate the disaster preparedness
  needs of four linguistically isolated population groups in Houston, Texas (Vietnamese,
  Chinese, Somali, and Spanish-speaking) in partnership with community-based organizations
  and community researchers. As a local health department conducting CBPR, we witnessed
  various challenges, including: engaging and using interpreters versus using community
  researchers; translating focus group questions from English to other languages;
  recruiting participants from linguistically isolated populations; and handling issues
  of community power, data collection, and data reliability. In this article, we discuss
  these challenges, strategies used, and the outcomes of our approaches in the broader
  context of CBPR.'
