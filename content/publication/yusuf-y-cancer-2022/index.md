abstract: "Study Purpose: Immigrants and foreign-born individuals, many with low English
  proficiency and low socio-economic status, make up a high proportion of the population
  in New York City (NYC). Immigrant populations have distinct demographic, immigration,
  social and biological histories, and environmental exposures that differentially
  impact their cancer risk profiles. However, while data on cancer incidence and mortality
  are widely available in this group, data on cancer-related social and behavioral
  priorities and resources among immigrant, low-income, low-English proficient communities
  is sparse. Method(s): Our research focus is to engage community stakeholders to
  identify multilevel determinants surrounding cancer prevention and disparities and
  assess resources available to adults within NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center
  (PCC) catchment area with a focus on racial/ethnic minority and immigrant populations
  through a health resources and needs assessment survey. With this research focus,
  we harmonized measures across questionnaires from other NCI-designated Community
  and Engagement Core (COE) Centers. Further, health priorities and questions in the
  survey were informed by listening sessions with diverse community partners and feedback
  from NYU PCC clinicians and basic scientists. We are translating the survey questionnaire
  into 8 languages commonly used in the geographical area of focus to prioritize data
  collection among immigrants in NYC: namely, Arabic, Bangla, Chinese, Haitian Creole,
  Korean, Spanish, Russian, Urdu. Data collection will be conducted through Open REDCap
  and paper surveys (n=1200). We are simultaneously developing a multilingual REDCap
  survey tool to be administered in the identified languages. Result(s): Participant
  recruitment strategies are tailored to survey hard-to-reach, low-English proficient
  communities through in-person recruitment, social media outreach, and engaging existing
  community-and faith-based organization partners. To facilitate wider reach, community
  health workers (CHWs) with strong community connections, language fluency, deep
  cultural knowledge, and training in working with immigrant communities have been
  recruited for data collection. Survey modules will explore common measures asked
  by NCI-designated Centers on sociodemographic information and knowledge, attitude,
  and behaviors and also include assessment on contemporary topics related to the
  impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening and care, including telehealth services.
  Recruitment and data collection phases are ongoing. Conclusion(s): This survey will
  determine community-driven cancer-related priorities and available resources among
  under-resourced immigrant communities and will contribute to strategic planning
  and resource allocation for the PCC to meet the needs of this population."
