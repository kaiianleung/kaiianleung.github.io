abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Improving health insurance coverage and retention in communities
  of color is a national priority and new approaches are needed. OBJECTIVE(S): To
  describe 1) the formation of Insure Detroit, a community-based participatory research
  (CBPR) partnership aimed at addressing health insurance and Affordable Care Act
  (ACA) literacy challenges in economically disadvantaged areas, 2) the development
  of Insuring Good Health, a novel, multimedia, health information technology-focused
  intervention to address the health aims of the partnership, and 3) the evaluation
  plan for the intervention. METHOD(S): Insure Detroit, a partnership between researchers
  and community-based organizations, was established. Principles of CBPR were followed
  closely in the conduct of this project. The Insure Detroit partnership developed
  the intervention and evaluation plan through an iterative process. The Insuring
  Good Health intervention is multilingual and composed of a responsive website. It
  includes nine short, animated videos informed by storytelling techniques that communicate
  key learning points pertaining to health insurance navigation and use. LESSONS LEARNED:
  Lessons learned included narrowing learning points for the intervention, balancing
  the volume of work to comply with the study timeline, and balancing the political
  climate with the development of the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): The Insure Detroit
  partnership demonstrates that a CBPR approach can develop media-based health communications
  to address health insurance literacy. Our experiences highlight that CBPR principles
  that encourage shared decision making and co-learning can result in high-quality,
  innovative interventions that have the potential to resonate well with communities
  of color.'
