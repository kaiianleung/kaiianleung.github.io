abstract: The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to explore shifts
  in gender dynamics among Somali female refugees who immigrated to the United States
  (U.S.). We used a community-based approach to recruit 30 participants who were interviewed
  by a bilingual interviewer. Themes were developed without preordained concepts.
  Results indicated most women came to the U.S. searching for safety and education.
  Participants reported increased freedoms, power, and demands within the family.
  Many women expressed a desire to maintain cultural, religious, and traditional gender
  roles. Implications for family therapists include attending to intersecting identities
  of Somali female refugees.
