abstract: "This Participatory Action Research (PAR) project aimed to engage students
  from an accelerated 'fast track' nursing program in a mentoring collaboration, using
  an interdisciplinary partnership intervention with a group of academics. Student
  participants represented the disciplines of nursing and paramedicine with a high
  proportion of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) students. Nine student
  mentors were recruited and paired with academics for a three-month 'mentorship partnership'
  intervention. Data from two pre-intervention workshops and a post-intervention workshop
  were coded in NVivo11 using thematic analysis. Drawing on social inclusion theory,
  a qualitative analysis explored an iteration of themes across each action cycle.
  Emergent themes were: 1) 'building relationships for active engagement', 2) 'voicing
  cultural and social hierarchies', and 3) 'enacting collegiate community'. The study
  offers insights into issues for contemporary accelerated course delivery with a
  diverse student population and highlights future strategies to foster effective
  student engagement."
