abstract: In this article we describe several process evaluation activities of Salud
  para su Corazon (Health for your Heart), a community-based Latino cardiovascular
  disease prevention and outreach program created by the National Heart, Lung, and
  Blood Institute which includes culturally relevant and language-appropriate materials
  for Latinos. Program activities evaluated included a series of 15 charlas, or group
  discussions, led by various health professionals, a telephone follow-up interview
  conducted after the charlas and a 21-segment radio program with distribution of
  educational materials. Data were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire
  completed by 200 people and from two telephone surveys of Latino men and women living
  in the Washington, DC area. Analyses included gender and age group comparisons of
  overall satisfaction with the charlas, diffusion of information from charlas and
  printed materials, participants' adoption of heart-healthy behaviors, and consumer
  satisfaction with the radio program and printed educational materials. Few gender
  and age differences were found and results showed that participants were satisfied
  with the charlas and the radio program. Between 54% and 87% of charla respondents
  reported sharing printed educational materials with others. The average number of
  bilingual booklets read by different gender and age groups was between four and
  five. The results demonstrate how programmatic activities of Salud para su Corazon
  were effectively disseminated in the Latino community of Washington, DC.
