abstract: 'Rationale: Despite substantial investments in research, asthma continues
  to pose a significant health burden for Hispanics in the US. In NYC, Hispanics have
  higher asthma prevalence than non-Hispanics (10.9% vs. 7.4%), and more than double
  the rate of ER visits (33.8% vs.12.8%). Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
  works with community members to define research questions and collaborate on the
  conduct of the research in order to derive more pertinent research questions with
  results that may be more readily adopted. We describe the results of collaboration
  with a community outreach organization to understand Hispanic asthma research needs
  and misconceptions, and the resulting intervention to improve asthma knowledge.
  Method(s): Partnering with the community outreach organization, El Poder de Decidir,
  we conducted 12 Hispanic community asthma meetings to identify research priorities.
  This was augmented by asthma education literature, and discussions with organizations
  experienced with Hispanic asthma outreach. Six Hispanic Asthma Community Leaders
  (ACLs) were trained using educational modules highlighting misconceptions about
  asthma. Modules were summarized in a brief asthma education card. At the completion
  of training, ACLs were also asked to react to 4 hypothetical asthma patient scenarios
  to test their knowledge. ACLs then assembled members from their community for teaching
  using the brief asthma education card, and observed by members from El Poder de
  Decidir and a bilingual pulmonologist. Participants completed preand post- asthma
  knowledge surveys, and results were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test. Result(s):
  The development of the intervention including the community workshops, education
  modules and brief asthma education card for ACLs was collaboratively developed over
  two years. The 6 ACLs were trained over the course of 3 months and were then observed
  as they taught a total of 104 participants. Among all participants, the mean knowledge
  score increased from 0.56 (sd 0.18) to 0.85 (sd 0.13) pre- and post- teaching by
  ACLs (0.282 (95%CI 0.25-0.31) t(103)=17.62); p=0.0001). At baseline the most commonly
  missed questions were about asthma symptoms and triggers, and that daily need to
  use asthma indicated the need for controller medication. Conclusion(s): We have
  successfully developed and tested an asthma education intervention for the Hispanic
  community which includes tailored education materials to build on identified misconceptions,
  and Hispanic ACLs to teach to their own community members. Further studies are warranted
  to determine whether these results persist among a larger group, what the comparative
  effectiveness is versus other education-based interventions and the longer term
  health benefits.'
