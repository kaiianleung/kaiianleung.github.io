 abstract = {Despite US federal legislation mandates institutions to provide meaningful access and participation to students and families in educational settings, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) families and caregivers of children in special education experience cultural and linguistic barriers. A Community Advisory Team (CAT) of parents, advocates, community interpreters and translators, researchers, and teachers explored CLD families' experiences and advocacy efforts. Critical bifocality and circuits of dispossession, privilege, and resistance informed the documentation of inequities and resistance to understand the linkages of structural arrangements of power. Focus groups with families (n=21) speakers of Spanish, Portuguese, and Cantonese were conducted. Findings indicate perceived discrimination, poor and inadequate interpretation and translation services impact children's access to special education services, hinder family's communication with schools and reduce the perceptions of schools as trustworthy institutions. Families advocate relentlessly for their children and recommend schools listen to families and hire culturally and linguistically competent interpreters and translators. Community psychologists can make significant contributions to promote language justice in education settings through participatory approaches to inquiry that value CLD families' knowledge and expertise.Copyright Â© 2022 Society for Community Research and Action.},
