abstract: Despite US federal legislation mandates institutions to provide meaningful
  access and participation to students and families in educational settings, culturally
  and linguistically diverse (CLD) families and caregivers of children in special
  education experience cultural and linguistic barriers. A Community Advisory Team
  (CAT) of parents, advocates, community interpreters and translators, researchers,
  and teachers explored CLD families' experiences and advocacy efforts. Critical bifocality
  and circuits of dispossession, privilege, and resistance informed the documentation
  of inequities and resistance to understand the linkages of structural arrangements
  of power. Focus groups with families (n=21) speakers of Spanish, Portuguese, and
  Cantonese were conducted. Findings indicate perceived discrimination, poor and inadequate
  interpretation and translation services impact children's access to special education
  services, hinder family's communication with schools and reduce the perceptions
  of schools as trustworthy institutions. Families advocate relentlessly for their
  children and recommend schools listen to families and hire culturally and linguistically
  competent interpreters and translators. Community psychologists can make significant
  contributions to promote language justice in education settings through participatory
  approaches to inquiry that value CLD families' knowledge and expertise.Copyright
