abstract: 'Mobile technology-based interventions show promise for conveying HIV prevention
  information to Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) and Latina transgender women
  (LTGW); however, implementing such interventions can pose serious challenges. To
  understand how to adapt existing interventions for these populations, we conducted
  nine focus groups (N = 91 participants, 52 LMSM, 39 LTGW) in Los Angeles, California.
  We used a rapid assessment process to create narrative reports that we examined
  using thematic analysis to explore differences across sites and between LMSM and
  LTGW. Lessons learned: requiring smartphone use could diminish participation of
  poor participants; sending personalized messages on the same days and times can
  help participants anticipate receiving study information; working with community
  partners is essential for building trust; recognizing different language literacies
  and diverse countries of origin can improve the cultural competency of intervention
  materials. Addressing these challenges may enhance efforts to address the HIV prevention
  needs of these communities.Copyright Â© 2019 The Guilford Press.'
