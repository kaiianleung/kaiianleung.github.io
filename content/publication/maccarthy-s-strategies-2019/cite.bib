 abstract = {Mobile technology-based interventions show promise for conveying HIV prevention information to Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) and Latina transgender women (LTGW); however, implementing such interventions can pose serious challenges. To understand how to adapt existing interventions for these populations, we conducted nine focus groups (N = 91 participants, 52 LMSM, 39 LTGW) in Los Angeles, California. We used a rapid assessment process to create narrative reports that we examined using thematic analysis to explore differences across sites and between LMSM and LTGW. Lessons learned: requiring smartphone use could diminish participation of poor participants; sending personalized messages on the same days and times can help participants anticipate receiving study information; working with community partners is essential for building trust; recognizing different language literacies and diverse countries of origin can improve the cultural competency of intervention materials. Addressing these challenges may enhance efforts to address the HIV prevention needs of these communities.Copyright © 2019 The Guilford Press.},
