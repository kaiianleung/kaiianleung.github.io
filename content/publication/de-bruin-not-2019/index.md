abstract: No two bilinguals are the same. Differences in bilingual experiences can
  affect language-related processes but have also been proposed to modulate executive
  functioning. Recently, there has been an increased interest in studying individual
  differences between bilinguals, for example in terms of their age of acquisition,
  language proficiency, use, and switching. However, and despite the importance of
  this individual variation, studies often do not provide detailed assessments of
  their bilingual participants. This review first discusses several aspects of bilingualism
  that have been studied in relation to executive functioning. Next, I review different
  questionnaires and objective measurements that have been proposed to better define
  bilingual experiences. In order to better understand (effects of) bilingualism within
  and across studies, it is crucial to carefully examine and describe not only a bilingualâ€™s
  proficiency and age of acquisition, but also their language use and switching as
  well as the different interactional contexts in which they use their languages.
