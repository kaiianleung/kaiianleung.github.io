 abstract = {Background 
Minority blood donations have historically been low in the United States; however, increasing the proportion of minority blood donations is essential to reducing blood transfusion complications—particularly in African Americans with sickle cell disease and thalassemia.
Objectives 
The research question was as follows: What are the facilitators and barriers to blood donation in minority populations?
Methods 
Beginning August 2017, we conducted a literature search using the following electronic databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Collection, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and PubMed, which continued through December 2017. Based on primarily descriptive data in the articles (n = 15), the systematic review proceeded as a meta-synthesis. An inductive approach was used to analyze commonalities, differences, patterns, and themes in the study findings; interpret the findings; and synthesize the findings to generate new knowledge about the phenomena of study.
Results 
The themes included (a) knowing a blood recipient; (b) identifying with culture, race/ethnicity, and religious affiliation; and (c) medical mistrust and misunderstanding. All were prominent in the descriptions of minorities on blood donation and exist as facilitators and barriers.
Discussion 
The reviewed studies demonstrated that facilitators and barriers to minority blood donations are complex and exist concurrently. Community education and communication about blood donation have a positive effect on fellow community members, including friends and family, in racial and ethnic minorities that are underrepresented among blood donors. Findings further suggest the need to rebuild trust among minority communities.},
