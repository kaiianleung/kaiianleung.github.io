abstract: 'Background  Minority blood donations have historically been low in the
  United States; however, increasing the proportion of minority blood donations is
  essential to reducing blood transfusion complications—particularly in African Americans
  with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Objectives  The research question was
  as follows: What are the facilitators and barriers to blood donation in minority
  populations? Methods  Beginning August 2017, we conducted a literature search using
  the following electronic databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Academic Search
  Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Collection, Cochrane Library, ProQuest
  Dissertation and Theses, and PubMed, which continued through December 2017. Based
  on primarily descriptive data in the articles (n = 15), the systematic review proceeded
  as a meta-synthesis. An inductive approach was used to analyze commonalities, differences,
  patterns, and themes in the study findings; interpret the findings; and synthesize
  the findings to generate new knowledge about the phenomena of study. Results  The
  themes included (a) knowing a blood recipient; (b) identifying with culture, race/ethnicity,
  and religious affiliation; and (c) medical mistrust and misunderstanding. All were
  prominent in the descriptions of minorities on blood donation and exist as facilitators
  and barriers. Discussion  The reviewed studies demonstrated that facilitators and
  barriers to minority blood donations are complex and exist concurrently. Community
  education and communication about blood donation have a positive effect on fellow
  community members, including friends and family, in racial and ethnic minorities
  that are underrepresented among blood donors. Findings further suggest the need
  to rebuild trust among minority communities.'
