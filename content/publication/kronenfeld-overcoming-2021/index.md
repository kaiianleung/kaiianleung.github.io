abstract: 'Hispanic and Latino (HL) cancer survivors are at a critical disadvantage
  compared with non‐Hispanic White (NHW) patients regarding sociodemographic adversities
  and access to equitable treatment options. By 2030, there will be about four million
  HL cancer survivors in the U.S., representing nearly 20% of survivors in this country.
  Hispanics and Latinos are subjected to significant challenges in accessing and receiving
  equitable care relative to NHWs. Hispanics and Latinos also experience lower rates
  of health insurance and financial resources, limiting health care options. These
  disparities often originate from disparate social determinants of health, including
  lower funding for education and school programs, greater neighborhood stressors
  and violence, lower access to healthy and affordable food, and greater barriers
  to community health and exercise opportunities. Even among HL cancer survivors with
  proper access to health care, they experience disparate treatment options, including
  low inclusion in clinical trials and/or access to experimental therapies. A solution
  to these barriers necessitates complex and systemic changes that involve, for example,
  investing in public health programs, increasing the diversity and cultural awareness
  of the medical workforce, and promoting research opportunities such as clinical
  trials that are inclusive of HLs. Only through meaningful reform will equitable
  cancer care be available for all in the U.S. regardless of racial and/or ethnic
  background. This article reviews some of the critical social determinants of health
  and biases relevant to HL cancer survivors and provides recommendations for achieving
  cancer health equity. Implications for Practice: Hispanics and Latinos experience
  a significant and often disproportionate cancer‐related burden compared with non‐Hispanic
  and Latino White individuals and other racial and ethnic groups. Meaningful reform
  to achieve health equity in oncology should focus on approaches to gaining trust
  among diverse patients, cultural and community sensitivity and engagement in oncology
  care and research, diversifying the workforce, and improving inclusion in clinical
  trial participation. Taken together, these recommendations can lead to exemplary
  and equitable care for all patients. This article examines the contextual and systemic
  factors that contribute to and exacerbate disparities in cancer care for Hispanic
  and Latino cancer patients.'
