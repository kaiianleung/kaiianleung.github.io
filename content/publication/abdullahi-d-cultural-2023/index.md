abstract: "Introduction: Stop the Bleed (STB), and other trainings that promote health
  education in basic trauma management techniques, is offered mostly in English and
  Spanish in the United States. Limited access to injury prevention training may contribute
  to inequities in health outcomes for individuals with limited English proficiency
  (LEP). Our study aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of STB training
  in 4 languages spoken in a super diverse refugee settlement community, Clarkston,
  GA. Method(s): Written STB educational materials were culturally adapted, translated,
  and back translated into 4 languages: Arabic, Burmese, Somali, and Swahili. Four
  90-minute in-person STB trainings were conducted by medical personnel with community-based
  interpreters at a central and familiar location in the Clarkston community. Pre-
  and post-tests were administered in participant's preferred language to evaluate
  change in knowledge and beliefs as well as the effectiveness of the training method.
  Result(s): A total of 46 community members were trained in STB, the majority of
  which were women (63%). Participants demonstrated improvement in their knowledge,
  confidence, and comfort using STB techniques. Participants reported that 2 aspects
  of the training were particularly beneficial: the presence of language concordant
  interpreters from the community and small group hands on sessions that allowed for
  practicing STB techniques. Conclusion(s): Cultural and linguistic adaptation of
  STB training is a feasible, cost-effective, and effective method for disseminating
  life-saving information and trauma education to immigrant populations who have LEP.
  Expansion of community training and partnerships to support the needs of diverse
  communities is both necessary and urgent.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023."
