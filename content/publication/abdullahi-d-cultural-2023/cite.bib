 abstract = {Introduction: Stop the Bleed (STB), and other trainings that promote health education in basic trauma management techniques, is offered mostly in English and Spanish in the United States. Limited access to injury prevention training may contribute to inequities in health outcomes for individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). Our study aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of STB training in 4 languages spoken in a super diverse refugee settlement community, Clarkston, GA. Method(s): Written STB educational materials were culturally adapted, translated, and back translated into 4 languages: Arabic, Burmese, Somali, and Swahili. Four 90-minute in-person STB trainings were conducted by medical personnel with community-based interpreters at a central and familiar location in the Clarkston community. Pre- and post-tests were administered in participant's preferred language to evaluate change in knowledge and beliefs as well as the effectiveness of the training method. Result(s): A total of 46 community members were trained in STB, the majority of which were women (63%). Participants demonstrated improvement in their knowledge, confidence, and comfort using STB techniques. Participants reported that 2 aspects of the training were particularly beneficial: the presence of language concordant interpreters from the community and small group hands on sessions that allowed for practicing STB techniques. Conclusion(s): Cultural and linguistic adaptation of STB training is a feasible, cost-effective, and effective method for disseminating life-saving information and trauma education to immigrant populations who have LEP. Expansion of community training and partnerships to support the needs of diverse communities is both necessary and urgent.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.},
