abstract: 'ISSUE ADDRESSED: Drowning is a global public health challenge with a need
  to ensure equity to drowning prevention information and interventions. In Australia,
  people born overseas are identified as being at greater risk of drowning. This paper
  presents findings from a community-based qualitative evaluation of swimming and
  water safety (SWS) programs delivered to adults from migrant backgrounds in Sydney,
  Australia. METHOD(S): A qualitative study was conducted in November-December 2019
  among 35 female participants of SWS programs targeted to adult migrants. While offered
  to all SWS program participants, no males took part in the study. Focus groups and
  interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using a deductive
  approach. The domains of enquiry were guided by the health belief model and the
  theory of planned behaviour. RESULT(S): Study participants were textgreater=25 years,
  first generation and most had lived in Australia for textgreater=10 years. Most
  were nonswimmers and were fearful of water prior to the program. Key themes were:
  direct SWS program outcomes, health and well-being; enablers and barriers to participation
  including: motivation, a program coordinator, fear and settlement priorities. CONCLUSION(S):
  Findings suggest that in order to increase SWS participation among migrant communities,
  the broader determinants of health need to be considered. Culturally appropriate
  strategies are required to enable both men and women equal opportunities to access
  SWS programs. SO WHAT: SWS programs provide multiple benefits for adult migrants;
  however, the impact on reducing inequities is limited, with broader multi-strategic
  health promotion approaches and policies required for inclusion and sustainability.Copyright
