abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cancer cause
  of death among US Hispanics. CRC screening among the Hispanic population is lower
  compared with non-Hispanic Whites. METHOD(S): The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory
  study was to better understand the barriers and facilitators of CRC screening and
  preference for stool-based testing collection methods among the predominantly Hispanic
  population of El Paso, Texas. Nine focus groups were conducted by a trained bilingual
  facilitator with a moderator guide informed by the literature. Transcripts of the
  focus groups were entered into qualitative analysis software and a thematic network
  was developed. RESULT(S): Fifty-six participants were recruited: average age was
  68.5 years, 58.9% were female, 98.2% were Hispanic, 87.5% had an annual income of
  less than $20,000, 58.9% had 9th grade education or less, 12.5% had a discount program,
  and 5.4% had no insurance. Barriers to CRC screening included cost, fear, and embarrassment.
  Facilitators to screening included in-person health education and physician recommendation.
  Participants preferred the hygienic nature of a stool test collected with a brush
  and bottle. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, there was a lack of knowledge regarding CRC
  and significant barriers to CRC screening. A community-based CRC screening program
  was subsequently developed from our findings.'
