abstract: Bilinguals understand when the communication context calls for speaking
  a particular language and can switch from speaking one language to the other based
  on such conceptual knowledge. There is disagreement regarding whether conceptually-based
  language switching is also possible in the listening modality. For example, can
  bilingual listeners perceptually adjust to changes in pronunciation across languages
  based on their conceptual understanding of which language they’re currently hearing?
  We asked French- and Spanish-English bilinguals to identify nonsense monosyllables
  as beginning with /b/ or /p/, speech categories that French and Spanish speakers
  pronounce differently than English speakers. We conceptually cued each bilingual
  group to one of their two languages or the other by explicitly instructing them
  that the speech items were word onsets in that language, uttered by a native speaker
  thereof. Both groups adjusted their /b–p/ identification boundary in accordance
  with this conceptual cue to the language context. These results support a bilingual
  model permitting conceptually-based language selection on both the speaking and
  listening end of a communicative exchange.
