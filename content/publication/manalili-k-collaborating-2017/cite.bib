 abstract = {Aims: Person-Centred Care (PCC) seeks to incorporate patient voices to inform research and healthcare policy and practice. However, effective engagement of diverse and under-represented communities is often a challenge, due to various barriers that hinder participation. Our research explored approaches to effectively engage ethno-cultural communities in patient-centred outcome research (PCOR). Method(s): Challenges in engaging ethno-cultural communities in healthcare and research include potential language and cultural barriers, and lack of resources. We partnered with the Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC), a community-based organization employing a 'connector model,' to recruit key trusted individuals with extensive reach within their communities who understand the barriers to healthcare access and engagement. ECCC provides "Community Connectors" with specialized training to effectively engage communities and liaise with service providers/ institutions. Drawing from participatory action research methods, six Connectors with an interest in PCOR were identified from Chinese, South Asian, Filipino, Latino-Hispanic, East-African, and Syrian communities. Connectors received training in PCOR for this study over six months. Result(s): In collaborating with Community Connectors, we were able to obtain diverse perspectives needed for the study. Six focus groups with 46 participants were conducted. Connectors employed various approaches to successfully engage each community, including: recruiting participants through their own networks e.g. use of social and ethnic media; conducting focus groups in different languages; and use of community settings during evenings/weekends to ensure access, availability, and comfort. Focus group participants and communities maintained active participation in validating research findings and guiding the development of knowledge translation products. Through this study, we ensured ongoing partnership with ECCC and together built research capacity in PCOR among the Connectors, in the aim of continuing sustained and meaningful engagement with diverse communities through our PCOR. Conclusion(s): Partnering with a community-based organization and exploring novel approaches to engaging ethno-cultural communities allowed us to obtain diverse perspectives needed for our PCOR. Incorporating patient voices requires addressing issues related to equity and understanding the barriers to effective and meaningful engagement that is representative of society's diverse make-up.},
