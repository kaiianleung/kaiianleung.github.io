abstract: 'There is evidence to suggest that certain executive functions are impaired
  in autistic children, contributing to many daily challenges. Regular use of two
  languages has the potential to positively influence executive functions, though
  evidence is mixed. Little is known about the impact of bilingualism on the executive
  functions of autistic children, with only a handful of studies published worldwide
  to date. This study investigated the impact of bilingualism on sustained attention,
  interference control, flexible switching and working memory, in Arabic-English autistic
  children (n = 27) and their typically developing peers (n = 66), aged 5-12 years
  old. Groups were matched on age, nonverbal IQ and socioeconomic status, and completed
  a battery of computerized tests. Results showed an advantage for bilingual autistic
  children relative to their monolingual peers in sustained attention, and equivalent
  performance between bilingual and monolingual autistic children on all other executive
  functions. There were no generalized positive effects of bilingualism, and typically-developing
  children performed better than autistic children on all measures. The findings indicate
  that bilingualism does not negatively impact the executive function skills of autistic
  children, and that it might mitigate difficulties in sustained attention. LAY SUMMARY:
  Contrary to widespread belief, but in line with previous research, this study showed
  that speaking two languages did not harm thinking skills in autistic children. The
  thinking skills evaluated in this study included the ability to focus over a period
  of time, the ability to resist distractions, the ability to move back and forth
  between tasks, and the ability to use short-term memory. In fact, speaking two languages
  might help reduce difficulties that autistic children might face when focusing over
  a period of time. Copyright Â© 2020 International Society for Autism Research and
