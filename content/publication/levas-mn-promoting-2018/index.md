abstract: "Background: Youth violence is a significant public health issue affecting
  youth who present to pediatric emergency departments. Racially and ethnically diverse
  populations, in particular, African American and Latino youth, are over-represented
  in the group of patients who present with firearm, stabbing and assault injuries
  to emergency departments. Youth victims of violence offer special challenges to
  provision of care given the extent of their injuries, the psychosocial aspects of
  an intentional injury, and the potential for seeking retribution. Program Description:
  For over twenty years, Project Ujima has served youth presenting to the Emergency
  Department/Trauma Center at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Youth
  ages 7 to 18 years are eligible for services if they have sustained an injury due
  to firearm, stabbing or physical assault. Community liaisons, who are employed by
  the hospital and on call, come to the emergency department (ED) and meet with the
  youth and their family members and obtain consent for program participation acutely
  following an injury. Community liaisons live in affected communities, are trained
  in cultural sensitivity, and, in some cases, are bilingual. If the youth are hospitalized,
  the community liaison visits the youth and family daily. When the youth is discharged,
  either from the ED or from the inpatient unit, home visits are arranged. Program
  services include: crisis management, mental health services, provision of resources,
  assistance with obtaining crime victim funds, and school and court advocacy. Once
  the youth and family have been physically and emotionally stabilized, they are invited
  to family and youth groups including a 6 week summer day camp and community-based
  family events. A group of twenty youth provide program direction through Project
  Ujima's youth leadership team whose guiding principles include promoting youth resilience,
  cultural sensitivity, community building, and building upon the strengths of each
  youth and their family. Emphasis is placed on providing services tailored to the
  needs of each youth and family member. The program also serves survivors in the
  Milwaukee community who have lost a family member to homicide or who have been affected
  by domestic violence, robbery, or other crimes. Services are partially funded through
  a grant via the Department of Justice Victim of Crime Act. Result(s): Over the past
  20 years, over 6,000 youth and their families have received services through Project
  Ujima. Seventy-five per cent of the youth are African American, 10% Latino and 15%
  White, with 70% of youth being male. In one study of the program, youth participating
  in Project Ujima had a 1% repeat violent injury rate, while youth not participating
  had an 8% repeat violent injury rate. Patient reported outcomes are currently being
  utilized to further evaluate program impact. The program is one of the founding
  members of the National Network on Hospital-Based Violence Intervention Programs
  (NNHVIP) and provides mentorship to hospitals that are interested in serving diverse
  populations. Conclusion(s): Youth from diverse populations who are affected by violence
  have been successfully served in a pediatric emergency department and in their communities
  by Project Ujima."
