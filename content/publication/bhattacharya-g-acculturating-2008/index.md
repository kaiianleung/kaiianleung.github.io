abstract: This study qualitatively explored social capital available to individuals
  (N = 17) within a community-based purposive sample of adult male immigrants from
  India in New York City (NYC). Analysis of in-depth interview data identified possible
  pathways for social capital's influences upon acculturative stress. The study defined
  social capital in terms of the participants' social relationships among peers, in
  the workplace, and with their ethnic community. Their relationships were assessed
  in terms of support, trust, and reciprocity. Among the recent immigrants, hopelessness
  and frustration about future work prospects were associated with symptoms of depression
  and substance abuse. The participants identified wealth as a distinct marker of
  social class and they described social class as a combination of education and occupation.
  Social class largely determined the particular peer and community networks each
  participant joined. Participants relied upon ongoing connections with family in
  India, despite their geographic separation, to relieve acculturative stress. Social
  support from peers was the participants' most useful and immediate resource for
  alleviating acculturative stress. For participants of lower socioeconomic status,
  acculturative stress was compounded by social-relationship expectations and norms
  from India that persisted within NYCs immigrant community. Namely, lower-SES participants
  were more likely to experience frustration and setbacks when they sought out intimate
  social relationships with women. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.
