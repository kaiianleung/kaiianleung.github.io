 abstract = {Among Latinas, breast cancer is the primary cause of cancer- associated mortality. Latinas experience breast cancerhealth disparities in disease-free survival, health-related quality of life, pain, fatigue, and anxiety, which may be aresult of experiences of chronic stress. Chronic stress can impact the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis,leading to changes in the tumor microenvironment and subsequently facilitate cancer progression. Little is knownabout the role of stress in cancer health disparities among Latinas. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of biospecimen collection and describe biologic and self-reported levels of stress using baseline data from arandomized controlled trial of a stress-management intervention among Spanish-speaking rural Latina breast cancersurvivors (LBCS). We used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to recruit women, conductinterviews, and obtain saliva and hair samples. Recruiters were bilingual-bicultural women from local communitiesworking in the community organizations that were research partners. Videos and print materials with graphics weredeveloped in low-literacy Spanish to demonstrate biospecimen collection procedures. Recruiters providedinstruction and demonstrations on sample collection and collected self-reported stress and depressive symptoms viain-person interviews in Spanish. Self-reported measures of stress and depressive symptoms consisted of thePerceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Biologic stress was measured usinghair (1 sample) and salivary cortisol (3 samples/day for 3 days). Mean hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in pc/mg units was used to assess chronic stress. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) measure assessed the activity of the HPA axis; curves that demonstrate a cortisol peak 30 minutes after awakening and a cortisol dip bedtime wereconsidered normal. We recruited 103 participants from the Central Valley and Imperial County, California. Eighty-sixpercent provided saliva samples for CAR analysis, and 53% provided hair samples for HCC. Participants' mean agewas 56 years (SD=10.6) and mean time since breast cancer diagnosis was 3.2 years (SD=3.2). Participantsreported moderate (PSS mean score = 14.5; SD 7.5) stress levels and mild depression (PHQ-8 mean score = 6.3;SD 5.5). Biologic stress measurements demonstrated that 37% of participants had an abnormal CAR at baseline,and elevated HCC (mean HCC = 362.9 pg/mg). Bivariate models showed no relationship between self-reported and biologic markers of stress. Using CBPR methods leads to successful recruitment of Latinas to clinical researchinvolving biospecimen collection. Although self-reported stress and depression were moderate or mild, biologicstress levels were high and abnormal in over 1/3 of participants, suggesting that chronic stress, and its subsequentintegration into the biologic stress pathways, may help explain ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes of LBCS.},
