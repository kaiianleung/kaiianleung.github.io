abstract: Prior studies using the event-related potential (ERP) technique show that
  integrating sentential code-switches in online processing lead to a broadly distributed
  late positivity component while processing semantically unexpected continuations
  instead lead to the emergence of an N400 effect. While the N400 is generally assumed
  to index lexico-semantic processing, the LPC has two different interpretations.
  One account suggests that it reflects the processing of an improbable or unexpected
  event while an alternative account proposes sentence-level reanalysis. To investigate
  the relative costs of semantic to language-based unexpectancies (i.e., code-switches),
  the current study tests 24 Spanish-English bilinguals in an ERP reading study. Semantically
  constrained Spanish frames either varied in their semantic expectancy (high vs low
  expectancy) and/or their language continuation (same language vs code-switch) while
  participants’ electrophysiological responses were recorded. The Spanish-to-English
  switch direction provides a more naturalistic test for integration costs to code-switching
  as it better approximates the code-switching practices of the target population.
  Analyses across three time windows show a main effect for semantic expectancy in
  the N400 time window and a main effect for code-switching in the LPC time window.
  Additional analyses based on the self-reported code-switching experience of the
  participants suggested an early positivity linked to less experience with code-switching.
  The results suggest that not all code-switches lead to similar integration costs
  and that prior experience with code-switching is an important additional factor
  that modulates online processing.
