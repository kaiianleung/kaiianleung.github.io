abstract: Objectives. - Pregnancy rates among Filipino American adolescents exceed
  those of other Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents. Strong parent-adolescent
  communication may promote healthy sexual development and protect against adolescent
  sexual risk behaviors. We explored communication barriers between Filipino American
  parents and adolescents. Methods. - Using community-based participatory research
  (CBPR), we collaborated with Filipino American community leaders, parents, and adolescents
  to design a focus-group study. Trained bilingual moderators conducted focus groups
  with 85 Filipino Americans (41 parents and grandparents and 44 adolescents aged
  14-18 years) from various neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Sessions were recorded,
  transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes. Results. - Focus-group participants
  appeared to divide sex information into 3 categories, which we termed facts, feelings,
  and values. Adolescents emphasized facts and feelings. Parents and grandparents
  emphasized facts and values. In general, facts were obtained through school, feelings
  through friends, and values through parents. The focus groups identified large barriers
  to value transmission, stemming from adolescent acculturation to the United States.
  Parents and grandparents felt that values were transmitted best through traditional
  Filipino respect for parents who often eschewed open discussion. Adolescents believed
  that open discussion was necessary for value transmission to occur. The result was
  bilateral withdrawal from family communication about sex. Conclusions. - Our focus
  groups found that parent-child communication about sex, especially regarding values,
  was limited. Potential causes included conflicts between Filipino and US beliefs
  regarding respect for parents and open discussion. Our results raise important questions
  about the effect of acculturation on sex education for Filipino American adolescents
  and demonstrate potential advantages of CBPR. Copyright Â© 2005 by Ambulatory Pediatric
