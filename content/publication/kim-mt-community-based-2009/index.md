abstract: Purpose The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a culturally
  tailored comprehensive type 2 diabetes management intervention for Korean American
  immigrants (KAIs) with type 2 diabetes. Methods A randomized controlled pilot trial
  with 2 parallel arms (intervention vs control) with a delayed intervention design
  was used. A total of 79 KAIs, recruited from the Baltimore-Washington area, completed
  baseline, 18-week, and 30-week follow-ups (intervention, n = 40; control, n = 39).
  All participants had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1C textgreater=7.5%)
  at baseline. The authors' comprehensive, self-help intervention program for type
  2 diabetes management (SHIP-DM) consisted of a 6-week structured psychobehavioral
  education, home glucose monitoring with teletransmission, and bilingual nurse telephone
  counseling for 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was A1C level, and secondary
  outcomes included an array of psychobehavioral variables. Results Using analysis
  of covariance, the findings support that the proposed intervention was effective
  in significantly lowering A1C and fasting glucose and also in improving psychosocial
  outcomes in the sample. Specifically, the amount of reduction in A1C among intervention
  group participants was 1.19% at 18 weeks and 1.31% at 30 weeks, with 10% and 15.5%
  of the participants achieving the suggested goal of A1C textless7% at 18 and 30
  weeks of follow-up, respectively. Conclusions The results highlight the clinical
  efficacy of the SHIP-DM intervention composed of a 6-week education program, self-monitoring,
  and follow-up counseling, in terms of maintaining the improved intervention effects
  obtained and in terms of glucose control. © 2009 The Author(s).
