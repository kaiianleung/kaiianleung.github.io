abstract: 'Introduction: Previous international research indicates that people with
  severe mental illness often experience lower levels of activity participation and
  may therefore be marginalized from occupational opportunities that support recovery.
  This study aimed to describe activity and participation patterns of consumers of
  mental health services living in the community and identify significant relationships
  with demographic characteristics. Method: A cross-sectional observational study
  design was utilized, via data mining of the Activity and Participation Questionnaires
  completed while receiving services from an area mental health service. Data for
  282 consumers, who submitted 333 questionnaires, were included. Results: Consumers
  were mostly engaged in home-based and unpaid work, and their participation in these
  tasks significantly increased over time. Significant relationships were found between
  activity participation and age, gender and primary language. Consumers who were
  older were less likely to participate in employment, education and physical activity,
  while female and culturally and linguistically diverse consumers were less likely
  to engage in activities in the community. Conclusion: Demographic factors may have
  a significant impact on the ability of consumers to participate in activities. This
  may require targeted approaches to activity and participation interventions for
  specific groups of consumers.'
