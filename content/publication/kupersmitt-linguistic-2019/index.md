abstract: 'The present study examines the linguistic expression of causal relations
  between the motion events within the main episode in a picture-based narrative.
  One hundred and fifty children aged 5-7 were asked to narrate a story based on a
  series of pictures: 45 Hebrew monolinguals (19 with Developmental Language Disorders
  [DLD]), 57 English-Hebrew bilinguals (20 with DLD) and 48 Russian-Hebrew bilinguals
  (21 with DLD). The narratives told by bilingual children with Typical Language Development
  (TLD) were as complex as those of their monolingual peers in occurrence of causal
  relations to establish a goal-oriented episode, and in the use of language forms
  as cohesive devices. By contrast, bilingual and monolingual children with DLD showed
  lower performance on expression of causal relations, particularly those involving
  more complex scenes that demand higher levels of linguistic complexity and content
  elaboration. The form-function analyses enabled an exploration of cognitive and
  language abilities in interaction in the context of narrative discourse production.
  The study reinforced the differences between children with TLD and children with
  DLD, showing that typical language development rather than the proficiency in a
  particular language is necessary for generating causal relations and the particular
  linguistic forms that together yield a coherent narrative. (PsycInfo Database Record
