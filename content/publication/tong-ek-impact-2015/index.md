abstract: "Background: Biospecimen collection from diverse populations can advance
  cancer disparities research, but are currently underrepresented. Little is known
  about the baseline knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to biospecimen collection
  among most racial/ethnic minority populations. Furthermore, appropriate messages
  that might increase biospecimen donations have yet to be explored and developed.
  Among Asian Americans, Chinese Americans are the largest subgroup, of which Cantonese-speaking
  men may have a higher cancer risk because they have the highest smoking prevalence
  rate (21.7%) among Californian Chinese, compared to 7.2% for English-speaking and
  14.1% for Mandarin-speaking men; this rate is higher than the general California
  population whose rate is 15.2%. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact
  of an educational seminar on an Asian American community's willingness to donate
  biospecimens in a randomized, controlled trial. Method(s): We partnered with a community-based
  clinic, Chinatown Public Health Center (CPHC) in San Francisco, serving Cantonese-speaking
  Chinese Americans to develop and revise an educational seminar on biospecimen collection.
  As a community-based participatory research project, the CPHC health education team
  was a key partner in all aspects of this study including design, recruitment, conduct,
  data collection, and analysis. Over 700 Chinese Americans from the general community
  contacted CPHC about the study from a bilingual flyer distributed at CPHC health
  education outreach events. From the large community response, 511 Chinese American
  adults were screened, 400 were randomized, and 395 were available for analysis.
  In the trial, the intervention seminar was compared with a control seminar (cancer
  prevention) on change in willingness to donate biospecimens. Result(s): At baseline,
  many were willing to donate a biospecimen (saliva, urine, hair, toenails, blood,
  unused cancerous tissue) whether healthy or hypothetically had cancer. Also, many
  would donate because future generations would benefit, and few had concerns about
  donation. In logistic regression analyses, there was an intervention effect for
  willingness to donate: urine if had cancer (OR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.3-3.7), toenails if
  healthy (OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-3.2) or had cancer (OR=2.3, 95% CI: 2.0-2.7), hair
  if healthy (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5) or had cancer (OR=2.8, 95% CI: 1.9-4.0), and
  unused cancerous tissue (OR=1.8, 95% CI:1.2-2.9). There was also an intervention
  effect for donating because future generations would benefit (OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.4-3.0),
  and this attitude was a strong independent predictor for willingness to donate all
  biospecimens, whether healthy or had cancer (OR=2.9-4.2). Conclusion(s): Cantonese-speaking
  Chinese American participants of an educational seminar on biospecimen collection
  showed greater increases in willingness to donate biospecimens and donating for
  the benefit of future generations, than participants who attended a control seminar."
