 abstract = {We use a community based participatory research approach to examine the processes of collaboration and communication, as well as the relational interactions of one community focused health promotion coalition, the Community Faces of Utah (CFU). We assess the evolution, structure, successes, and challenges of the coalition, comprised of five distinct cultural communities, a state health department, and a university. Researchers from the university collaborated with the coalition to find that CFU is an equitable, collaborative partnership of diverse leaders that functions successfully. Shared values and trusting relationships emerged over time, forming the basis for group interaction. A community liaison to facilitate interaction and collaboration was an essential element of the success of this partnership. The experience of CFU can guide other multi-sectoral partnerships in developing functionality consistent with achieving community driven objectives.},
