abstract: We use a community based participatory research approach to examine the
  processes of collaboration and communication, as well as the relational interactions
  of one community focused health promotion coalition, the Community Faces of Utah
  (CFU). We assess the evolution, structure, successes, and challenges of the coalition,
  comprised of five distinct cultural communities, a state health department, and
  a university. Researchers from the university collaborated with the coalition to
  find that CFU is an equitable, collaborative partnership of diverse leaders that
  functions successfully. Shared values and trusting relationships emerged over time,
  forming the basis for group interaction. A community liaison to facilitate interaction
  and collaboration was an essential element of the success of this partnership. The
  experience of CFU can guide other multi-sectoral partnerships in developing functionality
  consistent with achieving community driven objectives.
