abstract: This research examined whether perceived receipt of filial piety from adult
  children and ethnic community engagement-two major ethnocultural resources-were
  associated with psychological wellbeing of older Chinese American immigrants. Analyses
  used data from the PINE study, a sample of older Chinese adults in Chicago. Tobit
  regression revealed that elders who received more filial piety and visited community
  centers experienced less loneliness and depression than their counterparts did.
  Tests of interactions showed that community center visits moderated the negative
  relationship between perceived filial piety and depression. Results suggest the
  importance of community engagement for diminishing depressive symptoms in older
  Chinese American immigrants, particularly those with culturally weak intergenerational
  ties. Discussion centers on how visiting community centers in ethnically dense neighborhoods
  compensates for unfulfilled filial piety expectations by protecting the mental health
  of minority elders within a rapidly growing and acculturating immigrant population.
