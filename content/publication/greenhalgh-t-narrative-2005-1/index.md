abstract: "The objective of this study was to develop bilingual health advocate (BHA)-led
  group education and support groups for South Asian patients with diabetes, based
  on a storytelling format. The design and setting were action research in a deprived
  inner London district. The research team worked developmentally with BHAs, service
  users and other stakeholders to assess need, train staff, and set up and evaluate
  the storytelling groups. Stories were chosen as the main vehicle for education because
  of their universal appeal, memorability, holistic perspective, ethical dimensions,
  and potential for multiple interpretations. Key challenges in the project were:
  high burden of need; multiple stakeholders; a shifting baseline of policy directives;
  frequent staff changes; resource constraints; and resistance of top and middle management
  to new service models. These difficulties made progress slow, and several early
  initiatives failed to take root. However, we succeeded in developing a nationally
  accredited training programme ('Storytelling for group work in health and care')
  for BHAs, and in supporting the graduates from this course to set up two groups
  for South Asian patients with diabetes - one in a hospital and one in a community
  centre. The patient storytelling groups, once established, were popular and well
  evaluated. Blood glucose levels in regular attenders fell, but changes did not reach
  statistical significance. An action research approach allowed us successfully to
  develop an innovative training programme for BHAs and support them in developing
  and mainstreaming new service models. BHA-led diabetes storytelling groups, supported
  by health professionals, are feasible and popular with non-English speaking Asian
  patients. Their impact on diabetes outcomes should now be formally evaluated in
  clinical trials. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
