abstract: Culturally sensitive diabetes self-management programs have shown benefits
  for ethnic minorities. However, most of these programs are clinicbased and accessibility
  is limited for Korean immigrants who have high rate of uninsured and are likely
  to have language barriers. The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness,
  feasibility, and acceptability of a culturally tailored community-based diabetes
  self-management program (CTCDSP) for Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes (DM).
  Fifty Korean adults with DM participated in two weekly sessions of two hours CTCDSP
  in a Korean community center taught by a bilingual nurse practitioner. Repeated-measures
  ANOVAs were used to explore mean differences in behavioral and physiological outcomes
  as well as diabetes knowledge and self-care efficacy across the baseline, post-program,
  and 3-month follow-up assessment. Results showed increased number of exercise activities
  [3.1 to 3.6 to 3.8, F(2, 72) = 3.31, p textless .05] and feet checks [1.7 to 2.8
  to 3.1, F(2, 78) = 12.30, p textless .001] per week at each successive assessment.
  Participants' mean waist circumference decreased [38.5 to 37.4, F(1, 39) = 22.58,
  p textless .001], mean levels of high-density lipoprotein increased [44.0 to 48.7,
  F(1, 35) = 12.38, p textless .01], and mean levels of Hemoglobin A1C decreased [7.29
  to 6.76, F(1, 38) = 26.58, p textless .001] from the baseline to the 3-month follow-up
  assessments. Although differences in mean levels of diabetes knowledge and self-care
  efficacy across assessments did not reach statistical significance, the means were
  in the predicted direction, suggesting that significant differences may emerge in
  a larger study with more participants. Most participants reported being satisfied
  or very satisfied with the culturally tailored diabetes education (88.7%) program.
  Almost all participants (96.2%) indicated that they would recommend the program
  to a friend. CBDSMP may be an effective approach to improving diabetes outcomes
  in Korean and potentially other underserved ethnic minority immigrants who have
  limited access to clinicbased programs. The program is favorably received by patients
  with DM.
