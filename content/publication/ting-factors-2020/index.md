abstract: 'Introduction: Past studies pay little attention to the intention to donate
  hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) among blood donors. This study investigated the level
  of and the influence of socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude,
  subjective norm and self-efficacy on the intention to donate HSC among blood donors.
  Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited blood donors at selected public hospitals
  in the Malaysian State of Sarawak in 2019. A structured questionnaire was developed
  based on the review of relevant literature. It gathered information on socio-demographic
  characteristics, knowledge, attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy on the intention
  to donate HSC. Variables with a p value &lt;0.200 in bivariate analysis were included
  in the variable selection for regression modeling to examine their associations
  with the intention to donate HSC. Results: A total of 569 blood donors participated
  (94.5% response rate). Overall, 87.1% reported a positive intention to donate HSC.
  In the regression model, the factor with the greatest association with intention
  to donate HSC was subjective norms about HSC donation (β = 0.35, 95% CI 0.27–0.42),
  followed by attitude about regulations of HSC donation (β= 0.21, 95% CI 0.13–0.35),
  self-efficacy on HSC donation (β = 0.15, 95% CI 0.09–0.32), attitude about the potential
  side effects of HSC donation (β = 0.14, 95% CI 0.02–0.10) and highest education
  level (β = 0.10, 95% CI 0.03–0.44). Conclusions: The findings can be used to formulate
  a better strategy in promoting HSC donation among blood donors in the region.'
