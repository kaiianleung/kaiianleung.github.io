abstract: 'Study objectives: To translate, back-translate and crosslanguage validate
  (English/Spanish) the Sleep Heart Health Study Sleep Habits Questionnaire for use
  with Spanish-speakers in clinical and research settings. Method(s): Following rigorous
  translation and back-translation, this cross-sectional cross-language validation
  study recruited bilingual participants from academic, clinic, and communitybased
  settings (N = 50; 52% women; mean age 38.8 +/- 12 years; 90% of Mexican heritage).
  Participants completed English and Spanish versions of the Sleep Habits Questionnaire,
  the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans
  II one week apart in randomized order. Psychometric properties were assessed, including
  internal consistency, convergent validity, scale equivalence, language version intercorrelations,
  and exploratory factor analysis using PASW (Version18) software. Grade level readability
  of the sleep measure was evaluated. Result(s): All sleep categories (duration, snoring,
  apnea, insomnia symptoms, other sleep symptoms, sleep disruptors, restless legs
  syndrome) showed Cronbach alpha, Spearman- Brown coeffi cients and intercorrelations
  textgreater= 0.700, suggesting robust internal consistency, correlation, and agreement
  between language versions. The Epworth correlated signifi cantly with snoring, apnea,
  sleep symptoms, restless legs, and sleep disruptors) on both versions, supporting
  convergent validity. Items loaded on 4 factors accounted for 68% and 67% of the
  variance on the English and Spanish versions, respectively. Conclusion(s): The Spanish-language
  Sleep Habits Questionnaire demonstrates conceptual and content equivalency. It has
  appropriate measurement properties and should be useful for assessing sleep health
  in community-based clinics and intervention studies among Spanish-speaking Mexican
  Americans. Both language versions showed readability at the fifth grade level. Further
  testing is needed with larger samples.'
