abstract: Mexican American elders' and their caregivers' awareness of available home
  care services is one of nine factors hypothesized to be associated with underuse
  of home care services. Previous instruments did not fully measure service awareness.
  The objective of this study was to explore the conceptual foundation of service
  awareness, generate items, and establish language equivalence in Spanish and English
  for the Service Awareness Scale. A hybrid use of the literature and fieldwork were
  used to develop the concept and generate items. The team used back-translation and
  community collaboration to test for language equivalence. Concept development and
  language equivalence were achieved for the Service Awareness Scale. Teaching/learning
  theories contributed to the definition and inductive validity of service awareness
  and item generation and can shape future interventions. Bicultural/bilingual community
  and research team partners refined its measure. The scale will be usable in research
  and practice designed to promote equity in health care use.
