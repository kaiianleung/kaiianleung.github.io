abstract: "This study examined whether bilingualism boosts Theory of Mind as measured
  by a non-verbal false belief (FB) task in children with autism spectrum disorder
  (ASD), and how this potential boost may stem from improvements in a variety of other
  domains, namely executive functions (EFs), language, metalinguistic awareness skills,
  as well as autism severity. One hundred and three children with ASD (7- to 15-year-olds)
  (43 bilingual and 60 age- and IQ-matched monolingual children) were tested on a
  nonverbal task of attentional switching, working memory and updating task, and an
  online, low-verbal first-order FB task. Results showed a clear FB benefit for bilingual
  children with ASD as compared with their monolingual peers. There were also boosts
  in EF, however, there is no evidence that these EF boosts drove the FB advantage.
  Enhanced FB was not explained either by language, metalinguistic skills, or lower
  autism severity. While the results do not conclusively settle the debate on what
  triggers the ToM advantage in bilingual children with ASD, the empirical picture
  of the current study suggests that the ToM component of FB understanding in bilingual
  children with ASD is enhanced by the bilingual experience per se. LAY SUMMARY: The
  current study aimed to determine if and how bilingualism may improve the ability
  to understand others' beliefs in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We
  assessed their belief reasoning alongside a series of other skills hypothesized
  to be beneficial for such reasoning, namely understanding, producing, and thinking
  about language, recalling and switching between information, and the severity of
  their autistic symptoms. The overall findings highlight advantages for bilingual
  children with ASD over their monolingual peers for grasping beliefs, thus suggesting
  that pursuing bilingualism may be beneficial for cognition in ASD. Other boosts
  were also associated with bilingualism, such as recalling and switching between
  information, but these boosts were not directly related to belief understanding,
  highlighting the beneficial role of bilingualism per se. Copyright Â© 2021 International
