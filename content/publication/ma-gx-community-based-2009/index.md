abstract: 'Background: Despite evidence of a decline in both incidence and prevalence
  of colorectal cancer nationwide, it remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer
  and the third highest cause of mortality among Asian Americans, including Korean
  Americans. This community-based and theoretically guided study evaluated a culturally
  appropriate intervention program that included a bilingual cancer educational program
  among Korean Americans including information on CRC risks, counseling to address
  psychosocial and access barriers, and patient navigation assistance. Method(s):
  A two-group quasi-experimental design with baseline and post-intervention assessment
  and a 12-month follow-up on screening was used in the study. Korean Americans (N
  = 167) were enrolled from six Korean churches. The intervention group received culturally
  appropriate intervention program addressing accessibility and psychosocial barriers,
  and navigation assistance for screening. The control group received general health
  education that included cancer-related health issues and screening. Result(s): There
  was a significant difference (p textless 0.05) between the post-intervention and
  control groups in awareness of CRC risk factors. There was also a significant improvement
  in the pre-post across HBM measures in the intervention group for perceived susceptibility
  (p textless 0.05) and benefits and barriers to screening (p textless 0.001). At
  baseline, 13% of participants in the intervention group and 10% in control group
  reported having had a CRC cancer screening test in the previous year. At the 12-month
  post-intervention follow-up, 77.4% of participants in the intervention group had
  obtained screening compared to 10.8% in the control group. Conclusion(s): While
  health disparities result from numerous factors, a culturally appropriate and church-based
  intervention can be highly effective in increasing knowledge of and access to, and
  in reducing barriers to CRC screening among underserved Koreans. Â© 2009 Elsevier
