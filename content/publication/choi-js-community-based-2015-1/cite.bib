 abstract = {Objectives: Despite increasing evidence of hearing impairment in older adults being associated with a decline in cognitive and physical function, hearing health care remains complex and expensive for most older adults. Navigating the hearing health care system is challenging for minorities with language and cultural barriers, including older Korean Americans who are predominantly first-generation immigrants. This study aims to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention to provide hearing counseling and affordable amplification devices to older Korean Americans with hearing impairment. Method(s): Our study consisted of 3 stages: (1) development of the intervention through exploratory focus groups, (2) trial of intervention to 10 to 15 older Korean Americans and their communication partners, and (3) qualitative evaluation. Preand postintervention changes were measured in communication, social isolation, depression, quality of life, stigma, and third-party disability. Result(s): We have learned that many older Korean Americans do not seek help for hearing or adopt the use of listening devices due to language and financial barriers along with sociocultural factors related to stigma toward aging and disability. We have developed a culturally tailored program that consists of a 1-hour session that teaches how to use an amplification device and communication tips followed by a group practice session. Preliminary implementation has demonstrated positive responses from the participants. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to report a hearing health care model using a community outreach program in a population of Korean American older adults. A community-based hearing health intervention can be an effective way to address poor access to hearing health care among minority older adults.},
