abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Although there is strong scientific, policy, and community
  support for community-engaged research (CEnR)-including community-based participatory
  research (CBPR)-the science of CEnR is still developing., OBJECTIVE: To describe
  structural differences in federally funded CEnR projects by type of research (i.e.,
  descriptive, intervention, or dissemination/policy change) and race/ethnicity of
  the population served., METHODS: We identified 333 federally funded projects in
  2009 that potentially involved CEnR, 294 principal investigators/project directors
  (PI/PD) were eligible to participate in a key informant (KI) survey from late 2011
  to early 2012 that asked about partnership structure (68% response rate)., RESULTS:
  The National Institute on Minority Health & Health Disparities (19.1%), National
  Cancer Institute (NCI; 13.3%), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC; 12.6%) funded the most CEnR projects. Most were intervention projects (66.0%).
  Projects serving American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN) populations (compared
  with other community of color or multiple-race/unspecified) were likely to be descriptive
  projects (ptextless.01), receive less funding (ptextless.05), and have higher rates
  of written partnership agreements (ptextless.05), research integrity training (ptextless.05),
  approval of publications (ptextless.01), and data ownership (ptextless.01). AIAN-serving
  projects also reported similar rates of research productivity and greater levels
  of resource sharing compared with those serving multiple-race/unspecified groups.,
  CONCLUSIONS: There is clear variability in the structure of CEnR projects with future
  research needed to determine the impact of this variability on partnering processes
  and outcomes. In addition, projects in AIAN communities receive lower levels of
  funding yet still have comparable research productivity to those projects in other
  racial/ethnic communities.'
