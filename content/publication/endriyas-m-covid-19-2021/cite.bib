 abstract = {Objective To assess community practices related to COVID-19 prevention and its associated factors during the early introduction of the disease to the study area. Setting and participants A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study. Outcome measure A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. Results From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures. Conclusion COVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.
