abstract: Objective To assess community practices related to COVID-19 prevention and
  its associated factors during the early introduction of the disease to the study
  area. Setting and participants A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted
  in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns
  with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in
  the study. Outcome measure A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO
  data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation,
  while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected
  by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed
  using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed.
  Results From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women
  and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and
  about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with
  soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19,
  respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the
  interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three
  recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational
  status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising
  COVID-19 prevention measures. Conclusion COVID-19 prevention practice was low as
  only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and
  wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different
  forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned
  government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.Copyright
