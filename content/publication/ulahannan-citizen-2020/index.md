abstract: 'Objective India reported its first COVID-19 case in the state of Kerala
  and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government
  of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for
  public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured
  data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding
  refinement to generate open and reusable datasets.Materials and Methods Through
  a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified
  data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets
  to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through
  a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the
  frontend.Results From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily
  updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard
  (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability,
  the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis.
  Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals
  affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak.Discussion
  We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented
  with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19
  in Kerala.Conclusion We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak
  in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized
  for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of
  affected individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing
  interest.Funding StatementThis study was not funded by any agencies and was purely
  a voluntary effort during the community-wide quarantine period by a team of technologists,
  academicians, students, and the general public advocating open data and citizen
  science.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed,
  and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe
  details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research
  described are given below:Since the data collected were publicly available, no individual
  consent and ethical approval were required for the study.All necessary patient/participant
  consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI
  understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies
  must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
  I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and
  the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered
  retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why
  the study was not registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research
  reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting
  checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesThe
