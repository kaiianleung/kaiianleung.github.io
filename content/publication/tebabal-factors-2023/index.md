  individual for transfusion to someone else. WHO estimates that it is necessary to
  donate blood to 2% to 3% of the country’s population to meet blood needs. However,
  blood donation remains challenging in developing countries. This study aimed to
  identify factors influencing blood donation practices among healthcare providers
  in public hospitals in Bahir Dar City. This institution-based unmatched case-control
  study was conducted in Bahir Dar City Public Hospitals from May 01 to May 25, 2022.
  Total sample size was 491 (123 cases and 368 controls) and then the study subject
  was selected by using simple random sampling technic and collect data through self-administered
  questionnaire. Bi-variable and multi-variable binary logistic regression analyses
  were used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables.
  Finally, the results are presented in charts and tables, and the AOR and CI are
  reported. Statistical significance was set at P textless 0.05. Fear of anemia (adjusted
  odds ratio (AOR): 0.02; 95% CI 0.007–0.078), lack of opportunity (AOR: 0.42; 95%
  CI 0.22–0.83), lack of time (AOR: 0.03; 95% CI, 0.005–0.199), profession (AOR: 0.15;

  willingness to donate blood (AOR: 5.09; 95% CI 2.25–11.50), blood group type (AOR:
  5.67; 95% CI 1.42–22.68), and higher work experience (AOR: 7.99; 95% CI 2.59–24.67)
