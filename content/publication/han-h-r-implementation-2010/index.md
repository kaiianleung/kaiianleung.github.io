abstract: 'Objective: Nurse telephone counseling can improve the management of chronic
  conditions, but the effectiveness of this approach in underserved populations is
  unclear. This study evaluated the use of bilingual nurse-delivered telephone counseling
  in Korean Americans (KAs) participating in a community-based intervention trial
  to improve management of hypertension. Method(s): KAs were randomized to receive
  12 months of hypertension-related telephone counseling that was more intensive (bi-weekly)
  or less intensive (monthly). Counseling logs were kept for 360 KAs who completed
  the pre- and post-intervention evaluations. Result(s): The overall success rate
  for the intervention was 80.3%. The level of success was significantly influenced
  by the dose of counseling, employment status, and years of US residence. Over the
  12-month counseling period, both groups showed improvement with regard to medication-taking,
  alcohol consumption, and exercise but not smoking, with no significant group differences.
  Conclusion(s): Bilingual telephone counseling could reach monolingual KAs and improve
  their hypertension management behavior. Practice implications: Bilingual nurse telephone
  counseling may have wide applicability, serving as an effective means of disseminating
  evidence-based chronic disease management guidelines to a linguistically isolated
  community with limited health resources and information. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ireland
