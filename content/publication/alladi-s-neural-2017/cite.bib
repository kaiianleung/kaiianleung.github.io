 abstract = {Background: With the rising burden of dementia globally, there is a need to identify strategies to prevent dementia or delay its onset. Recent studies report the protective role of life-course experiential factors such as education, occupation and physical exercise. Recently bilingualism has emerged as potential protective factor. How these factors protect against dementia continues to be a matter of debate. In this study, we aimed to study the neural basis for a protective role for bilingualism against cognitive decline, using a multimodality approach. Method(s): 85 subjects with a range of cognitive status from normal cognition (n=32), to Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia (n=53) participated. Subjects were recruited from an ongoing community based longitudinal study of cognitive decline in India. The cohort consisted of subjects of varying educational levels - from illiterate to highly literate and subjects with varying levels of language use, from monolingual to high levels of bilingualism. All subjects underwent detailed evaluation that included cognitive testing on a range of tasks, demographic evaluation, educational, occupation and language profiles. Fractional anisotropy measures derived from high-resolution diffusion- tensor imaging (DTI) on a 3 Tesla MRI was used as an indicator of white matter integrity. Result(s): Our study showed that in participants with normal cognition, being bilingual conferred an advantage in cognitive tasks that were indictors of conflict resolution in attentional/executive demands and visuospatial functions. On regression analysis, accounting for education, age and gender, lower FA values were noted in corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in bilingual compared to monolingual patients with cognitive impairment, for the same severity of impairment. Cognitively normal bilinguals had higher FA values in similar white matter areas compared to their monolingual counterparts. Conclusion(s): Reduced white matter integrity in bilinguals with cognitive impairment compared to monolinguals with similar level of impairment, and higher fiber tract integrity in cognitive normal bilinguals is consistent with the hypothesis that the bilingualism plays a role in enhancing cognitive reserve. The underlying neural mechanism is likely to be related to integrity in tracts that have a role in inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric connectivity, semantic processing and executive control.},
