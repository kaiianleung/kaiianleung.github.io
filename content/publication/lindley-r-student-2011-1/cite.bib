 abstract = {Background and Purpose: Community Based Medical Education (CBME) clinical staff have seen increasing numbers of patients without English fluency, increasing UK medical student numbers1 and the increase in community placements. This has resulted in more students observing non-English language community-based consultations. Anecdotally, negative comments have been raised by students regarding this potentially rich learning environment. Data was gathered to explore the students' opinions of non-English language consultations. Methodology: Comments regarding community learning experiences were gathered from year three and four students using mixed methods. Data was themed using a grounded theory approach. Result(s): Students' perceptions of non-English language consultations were frequently negative. They suggested that little learning was possible in this environment and the overall experience was viewed poorly. Students enjoyed talking to patients but this was much harder if they had no shared language. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Implications of students' perceptions of medical interactions with patients who do not speak English are important in a globally mobile population. Concepts such as cultural competency, professionalism,2 and patient centredness3 may be lost without addressing this issue. Students may miss the opportunity to learn how serve the full range of their patient population in their future careers. Future work is required by university and community tutors to maximise the potential learning from this rich environment to effectively translate into a useful experience for students.},
