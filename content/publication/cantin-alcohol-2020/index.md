abstract: 'Health care providers (HCPs) have an important role in screening for alcohol
  use across the lifespan, particularly during the childbearing years, and providing
  brief intervention to yield optimal outcomes and prevent the potential teratogenic
  effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.Objective The purpose of this study was to
  describe the current alcohol screening practices of Canadian HCPs who care for pregnant
  women and women of childbearing age.Methods An online survey was administered in
  2017 with the aim to identify current knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs
  among Canadian HCPs on screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT)
  for alcohol use for this population. The bilingual survey was disseminated by 4
  national professional associations. A total of 634 interprofessional clinicians
  completed to the survey. Descriptive analysis was completed for the respondent’s
  profession and their practices related to alcohol SBIRT. Cross-tabulation analyses
  explored the use of different screening questionnaires.Results Most respondents
  reported asking about alcohol use; however, there was a low overall use of screening
  questionnaires for both women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant. Low
  screening rates may equate to missed opportunities for intervention. Low rates of
  brief intervention and referral were noted even in circumstances where at-risk drinking
  was identified, with only 16.4% of respondents intervening when pregnant women reported
  at-risk alcohol consumption.Conclusion Continued efforts are needed to improve alcohol
  screening practices among women’s HCPs across Canada. Priority areas for training
  include: understanding validated alcohol screening questionnaires; incorporating
  brief intervention into routine care; and developing local referral pathways.Competing
