abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To examine the individual and collective contribution of biological
  and socioenvironmental factors associated with language function at 2, 5, 7, and
  13 years in children born preterm (textless30 weeks' gestation or textless1250 g
  birth weight)., METHODS: Language function was assessed as part of a prospective
  longitudinal study of 224 children born preterm at 2, 5, 7, and 13 years using age-appropriate
  tools. Language Z-scores were generated based on a contemporaneous term-born control
  group. A selection of biological factors (sex, small for gestational age, bronchopulmonary
  dysplasia, infection, and qualitatively defined brain injury) and early socioenvironmental
  factors at age 2 years (primary income earner employment status and type, primary
  caregiver education level, English as a second language, parental mental health
  history, parent sensitivity and facilitation, and parent-child synchrony) was chosen
  a priori. Associations were assessed using univariable and multivariable linear
  regression models applied to outcomes at each time point., RESULTS: Higher primary
  caregiver education level, greater parent-child synchrony, and parent sensitivity
  were independently associated with better language function across childhood. Socioenvironmental
  factors together explained an increasing percentage of the variance (9%-18%) in
  language function from 2 to 13 years of age. In comparison, there was little evidence
  for associations between biological factors and language function, even during early
  childhood years., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of socioenvironmental
  factors over biological factors for language development throughout childhood. Some
  of these socioenvironmental factors are potentially modifiable, and parent-based
  interventions addressing parenting practices and education may benefit preterm children's
  language development."
