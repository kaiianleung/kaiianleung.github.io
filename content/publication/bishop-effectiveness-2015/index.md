abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recruiting minorities and underserved populations into population-based
  studies is a long standing challenge. This study examined the feasibility of recruiting
  adults from a community research registry., METHODS: Ethnically diverse, bilingual
  staff attended health fairs, inviting adults to join a registry. We examined rates
  of successful contact, scheduling, and participation for studies that used the registry.,
  RESULTS: Five studies queried 6,886 research registry members (48% Hispanic and
  38% black) and attempted to contact 2,301 potentially eligible participants; eligibility
  criteria varied across studies. We successfully contacted 1,130 members, 51.9% were
  scheduled to participate and of those, 60.8% completed their study appointment.
  Non-Hispanic whites were less likely than Hispanics to be interested, but among
  those scheduling an appointment, participation did not differ by race/ethnicity.,
  CONCLUSION: Community research registries are a feasible and efficient method for
  recruiting minority and underserved adults and may address disparities in access
  to and participation in health research. Copyright Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.'
