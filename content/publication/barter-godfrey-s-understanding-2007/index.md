abstract: "Objective: To understand low uptake of breast cancer screening through
  exploring the personal reasoning underlying women's attendance or non-attendance,
  and identifying differences between those who attend and those who decline. Design(s):
  Cross-sectional survey. Setting(s): Community and home environments of women eligible
  for breast screening aged 50-64 years, living in South East London. Method(s): Structured,
  self-completed or assisted-completion questionnaires. Result(s): The decision to
  attend or decline screening is rational and personally justifiable, engaging factors
  linked to emotions and attitude. Attitudes about breast screening and perceived
  personal importance of breast screening are the strongest predictors of attendance
  and non-attendance. There are differences between ethnic groups in perceptions of
  breast screening. Regular attendance at screening is associated with ethnicity,
  although consistent avoidance of mammography is not. Inconvenience is an important
  factor in missing appointments, and tends to be prolonged rather than specific to
  the time or day of the pre-booked invitation. GP and health worker advice are good
  persuaders towards attendance. Pain and anxiety during mammography are notable dissuaders
  against re-attending. Conclusion(s): Appropriate service provision requires consideration
  of local factors, as well as the medical needs of the population eligible for breast
  screening. Lay perceptions of potential personal costs of attending or not attending
  breast screening are important for guiding health promotion. Information providers
  should consider the language needs of a culturally and educationally mixed community.
  Health care professionals are well placed to encourage uptake of breast screening
  through disseminating information that promotes attendance, both within and outside
  the breast screening service. copyright Â© SAGE 2007."
