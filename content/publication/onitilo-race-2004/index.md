abstract: Background As bone marrow transplantation (BMT) increases, the availability
  of suitable donors becomes critical, especially for African Americans, who require
  a large donor pool to find a suitable match. Previous studies indicated willingness
  to donate marrow may be a barrier for achieving a large donor pool. Methods We conducted
  a random-sample, statewide telephone survey of 421 Caucasians and 408 African Americans
  in South Carolina to determine if racial differences in willingness to donate bone
  marrow exist. We assessed a general level of willingness, asking, “Will you be willing
  to be a marrow donor?” We assessed an additional level of willingness, asking, “Are
  you willing to be contacted about bone marrow donation?” Results We detected no
  racial differences in general willingness to donate (Caucasians 34%, African Americans
  32%, P = .52), although there was a difference in willingness to be contacted to
  sign-up for the registry (Caucasians 18.3%, African Americans 11%, P = .003). African
  Americans were more aware that better matches occur within the same race (P textless
  .0001). Caucasians were more knowledgeable about the registry (P textless .0001).
  Younger, more highly educated respondents indicated a greater willingness to be
  donors. In both races, fear of pain was the most common reason for unwillingness
  to donate, and it was significantly higher in African Americans. Conclusion Our
  study suggests reported lack of general willingness does not explain the racial
  disparities in BMT. Many who expressed willingness to donate were not willing to
  be contacted to sign up for the registry, especially African Americans. Education
  and adequate pain control may improve minority recruitment.
