abstract: 'Background Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder characterized by
  a consistent failure to speak in particular public settings despite speaking normally
  in other situations. However, quantitative SM research from China remains scanty
  at best. In response, this study aimed (1) to describe the sociodemographics and
  experiences of children and families with SM in China and (2) to identify sociodemographic
  and environmental correlates of SM in China.Methods This case-control mixed-methods
  study was composed of 172 cases with SM and 179 controls, recruited by online surveys.
  Multilevel logistic regression was performed to examine the association between
  potential correlates and SM.Results Only 51.2% of SM cases were diagnosed by a professional,
  and 31.1% of SM cases that received treatment were guided by a professional. Child
  SM was associated with: having two parents with an introverted personality (Adjusted
  odds ratio (AOR): 15.05, (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.39 – 42.07), being born
  to a mothers aged textgreater= 35 (AOR 6.44, 95%CI: 1.24-33.43), and having a sibling
  (AOR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.00 – 3.70). However, child SM was inversely associated with
  ever receiving bilingual (AOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.10-0.39) education or being enrolled
  in an international school (AOR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.35).Conclusions Findings suggest
  that many children with SM in China have not received professional treatment or
  interventions. Hereditary and social environmental factors may be contributing to
  childhood onset of SM in China. Novel policies such as access to special education
  resources, SM-training for therapists, and school support are needed to enhance
  the early detection and treatment of SM in China.Competing Interest StatementThe
