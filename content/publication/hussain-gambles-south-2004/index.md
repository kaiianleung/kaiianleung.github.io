abstract: "OBJECTIVES: This paper explores South Asian patients' views and experiences
  of clinical trial participation, as part of a larger study which sought to assess
  British South Asian under-representation in clinical trials., METHODS: The study
  was based on semi-structured interviews with South Asian trial participants in primary
  care and specialist treatment centres in the north of England. Fifteen South Asian
  patients who had participated in one of six different clinical trials to test pharmaceutical
  products comprised the study cohort., RESULTS: South Asian motivations to participate
  in clinical trials are similar to those of the majority 'White' population. Clear
  and concise trial information (provided by caring and understanding trial staff)
  was considered an important aspect of the respondents' experiences. Appealing to
  South Asian peoples' altruistic nature by making them aware of South Asian under-representation
  (especially in clinical trials that investigate illnesses prevalent in their community)
  was also identified as a strong motivational factor. Potential barriers to their
  participation included: trial burden (which bears heavily on the poor), language,
  and discriminatory practices in the NHS, which can lead to mistrust of health professionals.
  In addition, female modesty and preference for female trial staff was recognized
  as a 'cultural' barrier to participation., CONCLUSION: There are more similarities
  than differences between the experiences of British South Asians and 'White' trial
  participants. Present findings suggest that ethnicity operates at different levels.
  In addition to South Asian trial participants' culture, social class and gender
  are also as likely to affect their participation in clinical trials. To improve
  South Asian accrual rates, strategies should be designed to take into consideration
  linguistic differences and improving overall trust in the clinical trial team."
