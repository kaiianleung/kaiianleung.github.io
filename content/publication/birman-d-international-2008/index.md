abstract: The development of evidence-based mental health interventions for refugees
  is complicated by the cultural and linguistic diversity of the participants, and
  the need to balance treatment of past traumatic experiences with ongoing support
  during the process of acculturation. In an effort to gather \"practice-based evidence\"
  from existing mental health services for refugees, a collaborative study of International
  Family, Adult, and Child Enhancement Services (FACES), a comprehensive, community-based
  mental health program working with refugee children, was conducted to describe the
  program participants and service delivery model and to assess whether participants
  improved over time as a function of services. Results showed that participants improved,
  but that the improvement was not related to dosage of services. Implications of
  these findings for refugee mental health services are discussed and suggestions
  are made for future evaluation research of mental health services with refugees.
