abstract: The current study evaluated the separate and combined effects of bilingualism
  and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) on informativeness and definiteness marking of
  referential expressions. Hebrew-speaking monolingual children (21 with ASD and 28
  with typical language development) and Russian-Hebrew-speaking bilingual children
  (13 with ASD and 30 with typical language development) aged 4-9 years participated.
  Informativeness, indexed by referential contrasts, was affected by ASD, but not
  by bilingualism. Definiteness use was non-target-like in children with ASD and in
  bilingual children, and it was mainly predicted by children's morpho-syntactic abilities
  in Hebrew. Language-universal and language-specific properties of referential use
  are discussed.
