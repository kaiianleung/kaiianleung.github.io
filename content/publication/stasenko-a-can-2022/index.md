abstract: Individuals with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have a higher rate of
  atypical (i.e., bilateral or right hemisphere) language lateralization compared
  to healthy controls. In addition, bilinguals have been observed to have a less left-lateralized
  pattern of language representation. We examined the combined influence of bilingual
  language experience and side of seizure focus on language lateralization profiles
  in TLE to determine whether bilingualism promotes re-organization of language networks.
  Seventy-two monolingual speakers of English (21 left TLE; LTLE, 22 right TLE; RTLE,
  29 age-matched healthy controls; HC) and 24 English-dominant bilinguals (6 LTLE,
  7 RTLE, 11 HC) completed a lexical-semantic functional MRI task and standardized
  measures of language in English. Language lateralization was determined using laterality
  indices based on activations in left vs right homologous perisylvian regions-of-interest
  (ROIs). In a fronto-temporal ROI, LTLE showed the expected pattern of weaker left
  language lateralization relative to HC, and monolinguals showed a trend of weaker
  left language lateralization relative to bilinguals. Importantly, these effects
  were qualified by a significant group by language status interaction, revealing
  that bilinguals with LTLE had greater rightward language lateralization relative
  to monolingual LTLE, with a large effect size particularly in the lateral temporal
  region. Rightward language lateralization was associated with better language scores
  in bilingual LTLE. These preliminary findings suggest a combined effect of bilingual
  language experience and a left hemisphere neurologic insult, which may together
  increase the likelihood of language re-organization to the right hemisphere. Our
  data underscore the need to consider bilingualism as an important factor contributing
  to language laterality in patients with TLE. Bilingualism may be neuroprotective
  pre-surgically and may mitigate post-surgical language decline following left anterior
  temporal lobectomy, which will be important to test in larger samples.Copyright
