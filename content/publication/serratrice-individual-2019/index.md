abstract: One hundred and seventy-two English-speaking 5- to 7-year-olds participated
  in a referential communication task where we manipulated the linguistic mention
  and the visual presence of a competitor alongside a target referent. Eighty-seven
  of the children were additionally exposed to a language other than English (bilinguals).
  We measured children’s language proficiency, verbal working memory (WM), cognitivecontrol
  skills, family SES, and relative amount of cumulative exposure and use of the home
  language for the bilinguals. Children’s use of full Noun Phrases (NPs) to identify
  a target referent was predicted by the visual presence of a competitor more than
  by its linguistic mention. Verbal WM and proficiency predicted NP use, while cognitive
  control skills predicted both the ability to use expressions signallingdiscourse
  integration and sensitivity to the presence of a discourse competitor, but not of
  a visual competitor. Bilingual children were as informative as monolingual children
  once proficiency was controlled for.
