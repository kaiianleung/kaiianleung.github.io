abstract: 'Issue addressed: Recently arrived migrants and refugees from a culturally
  and linguistically diverse background (CALD) may be particularly vulnerable to social
  exclusion. Participation in sport is endorsed as a vehicle to ease the resettlement
  process; however, in Australia, this is often thought as a simple matter of integration
  into existing sport structures (e.g. clubs). This approach fails to place actual
  community needs at the centre of sport engagement efforts. Method(s): A consultation
  framework was established with South Australian CALD community leaders and organisations
  to scope needs for community-based alternatives to participation in traditional
  sport (e.g. clubs), co-design a suitable community sport program and pilot it in
  five communities. Interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted with participants,
  community representatives, stakeholders and volunteers. Result(s): Regular, free
  soccer activities engaged 263 young people from a great variety of nationalities,
  including over 50% refugees, in secondary state school and community-based sites.
  Conclusion(s): Alternative community sport programs can provide a basic but valuable
  forum to promote physical activity and associated well being in CALD and refugee
  communities.So what?: Alternative approaches can extend the health benefits of sport
  participation to disadvantaged children and youth who are excluded from traditional
  sport participation opportunities.'
