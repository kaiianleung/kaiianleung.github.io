 abstract = {In bilingual communities, individuals often communicate in one of their languages only, and they adjust to the linguistic background of different interlocutors with ease. What facilitates such efficiency? We investigated whether bilinguals’ language activation is supported by non-linguistic cues (e.g., interlocutor identity). First, in an audio–visual task, early (proficient) and late (less proficient) Basque–Spanish bilinguals were familiarized with six novel interlocutors who spoke either Spanish, Basque, or both languages. Then, participants completed an audio–visual lexical decision task, in which the interlocutors produced test items in Spanish or Basque. Early, but not late, bilinguals’ speed of processing decreased when the language that the interlocutors spoke during familiarization matched the language they spoke at test, relative to test trials when the interlocutors changed languages. Overall, results suggest that proficient and/or early bilinguals benefit from an association between language and interlocutor during (or even before) language comprehension, because they are able to predict the context-appropriate language based on non-linguistic cues, such as interlocutor context.},
