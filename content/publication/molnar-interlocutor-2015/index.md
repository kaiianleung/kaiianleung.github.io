abstract: In bilingual communities, individuals often communicate in one of their
  languages only, and they adjust to the linguistic background of different interlocutors
  with ease. What facilitates such efficiency? We investigated whether bilinguals’
  language activation is supported by non-linguistic cues (e.g., interlocutor identity).
  First, in an audio–visual task, early (proficient) and late (less proficient) Basque–Spanish
  bilinguals were familiarized with six novel interlocutors who spoke either Spanish,
  Basque, or both languages. Then, participants completed an audio–visual lexical
  decision task, in which the interlocutors produced test items in Spanish or Basque.
  Early, but not late, bilinguals’ speed of processing decreased when the language
  that the interlocutors spoke during familiarization matched the language they spoke
  at test, relative to test trials when the interlocutors changed languages. Overall,
  results suggest that proficient and/or early bilinguals benefit from an association
  between language and interlocutor during (or even before) language comprehension,
  because they are able to predict the context-appropriate language based on non-linguistic
  cues, such as interlocutor context.
