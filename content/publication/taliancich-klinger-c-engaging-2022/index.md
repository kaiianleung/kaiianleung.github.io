abstract: "PURPOSE: Speech-language pathologists and audiologists are called to serve
  an increasingly diverse patient population in the United States. This increased
  diversity highlights the need for clinicians to be educated early in their careers
  about best practices to serve patients and clients from diverse backgrounds. In
  this clinical focus article, the authors present the development, implementation,
  and preliminary perceptions of a culturally responsive clinical experience for speech-language
  pathology graduate students designed to engage them early in their learning career.
  METHOD(S): The pilot program was based on pillars of experiential learning and community
  engagement. Graduate students attended trainings aligned with a model of culturally
  relevant care to prepare them to conduct speech and language screenings and small
  group language enrichment in English and Spanish. RESULT(S): Preliminary analyses
  of student reflections indicated themes of positive perceptions about the experience
  and provided preliminary support for students learning about working with culturally
  and linguistically diverse populations in an early, intentional, and focused experience.
  CONCLUSION(S): Early personnel preparation to culturally responsive care is crucial
  to meet the needs of future caseloads. Further research into the effectiveness of
  this kind of program is necessary to identify which variables may have the most
  impact on a student's cultural sensitivity, awareness, knowledge, and skills."
