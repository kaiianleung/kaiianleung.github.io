 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Android tablet computers can be valuable tools for data collection, but their usability has not been evaluated in community-based participatory research (CBPR)., OBJECTIVES: This article examines the usability of a low-cost bilingual touchscreen computerized survey system using Android tablets, piloted with a sample of 201 community residents in Tampa, Florida, from November 2013 to March 2014., METHODS: Needs assessment questions were designed with the droidSURVEY software, and deployed using Android tablet computers. In addition, participants were asked questions about system usability., RESULTS: The mean system usability was 77.57 +/- 17.66 (range, 0-100). The mean completion time for taking the 63 survey questions in the needs assessment was 23.11 +/- 9.62 minutes. The survey completion rate was optimal (100%), with only 6.34% missingness per variable. We found no sociodemographic differences in usability scores., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Android tablets could serve as useful tools in CBPR studies.},
