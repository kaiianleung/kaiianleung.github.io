 abstract = {This study examined the relationship between a culture-compatible approach to mental health service and utilization as measured by dropout and total number of outpatient visits. The sample (N = 300) was 23.5% Mexican, 22.8% White, 18.1% Black, 17.1% Vietnamese, 16.8% Pilipino, and 1.7% other ethnic group. A culture-compatible approach was found to be effective in increasing utilization. Three culture-compatibility components were the best predictors of dropout status: language match of therapists and clients, ethnic/racial match of therapists and clients, and agency location in the ethnic/racial community. Pharmacotherapy, education, previous treatment and a diagnosis of psychosis were significantly related to remaining in therapy.},
