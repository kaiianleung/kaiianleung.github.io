abstract: 'This study examined the relationship between a culture-compatible approach
  to mental health service and utilization as measured by dropout and total number
  of outpatient visits. The sample (N = 300) was 23.5% Mexican, 22.8% White, 18.1%
  Black, 17.1% Vietnamese, 16.8% Pilipino, and 1.7% other ethnic group. A culture-compatible
  approach was found to be effective in increasing utilization. Three culture-compatibility
  components were the best predictors of dropout status: language match of therapists
  and clients, ethnic/racial match of therapists and clients, and agency location
  in the ethnic/racial community. Pharmacotherapy, education, previous treatment and
  a diagnosis of psychosis were significantly related to remaining in therapy.'
