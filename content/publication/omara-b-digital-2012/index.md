abstract: 'Objective: To report the processes and outcomes of a case study on digital
  technology, diabetes and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities.
  Design(s): The qualitative study was based on a literature review, consultations
  and testing of a framework through workshops and an interactive information session.
  Setting(s): Consultations, workshops and an information session conducted in western
  regions of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Method(s): A framework was designed to
  address the needs of CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using
  innovative digital technology strategies. This was based on the literature review
  and 20 consultations held with representatives from health service providers and
  community organizations. The framework was tested with the assistance of the Quang
  Minh Buddhist Temple through consultations, workshops and an interactive information
  session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras, in which 38 elderly women
  from the Vietnamese community participated. A descriptive and thematic analysis
  of participant feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice.
  Result(s): Participant feedback indicated that the information session achieved
  its goal of raising awareness of ways to use and access diabetes information using
  digital technology. However, participants noted areas for enhancement and improvement,
  including more focused and targeted engagement with peer-led techniques, the digital
  proficiency of participants and digital technology preferences based on age and
  cultural background. Conclusion(s): Digital technology was used to improve diabetes
  awareness information with elderly Vietnamese women, demonstrating the potential
  for application with others from CALD communities. However, there are continuing
  challenges in this approach, indicating the need for nuanced community engagement
  strategies that consider cultural context and familiarity with different kinds of
  digital technology. Â© The Author(s) 2011.'
