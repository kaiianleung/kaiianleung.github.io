abstract: This study tested the feasibility and short-term acceptability of a public
  health intervention for women aimed at reducing HIV/STD risk through counselling
  on a variety of protection methods, including the female condom, spermicides and
  diaphragms. Women from diverse community groups in Marseille, France participated
  in a five-session group intervention seeking to educate women about their bodies,
  teach protection skills, develop solidarity, and prompt community diffusion of information
  and new norms. Intervention sessions were held weekly, and included visual and hands-on
  demonstration materials and free protection supplies. Knowledge scores on protection
  methods improved over the course of the study, and 56% of respondents reported having
  tried the female condom at least once. The intervention was very highly rated, with
  the best-liked aspect (50%) being the group process. Women of African or French
  territories' origin rated the female condom more positively than women born in continental
  France or Europe. Evidence suggests that the approach used is feasible and well-liked
  by women of diverse cultural backgrounds in south-eastern France. Longer follow-up
  is required to assess behavioural change.
