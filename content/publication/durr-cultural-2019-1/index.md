abstract: 'Background: Food is a cultural symbol for Hispanics/Latinos, an ethnic
  group with high prevalence of diet-related diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.
  Evidence supports prevention of obesity and related diseases through nutrition education
  and lifestyle interventions delivered by paraprofessionals. This study examined
  cultural competency characteristics and cultural knowledge of paraprofessionals
  delivering a nutrition education intervention to low-income Hispanics/Latinos in
  an East South-Central state. Methods: A mixed-methods study with paraprofessionals
  was completed. A web-based, 42-item survey assessed demographics, cultural competency
  and diversity training in 76/. In-depth interviews about cultural knowledge and
  practices were completed with paraprofessionals providing nutrition education to
  Hispanics/Latinos (n=8). Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed.
  Results: The majority of the respondents were non-Hispanic Whites (88.1%) and had
  completed diversity training (86.8%). The first theme reported for consideration
  in nutrition education for Hispanics/Latinos is the inclusion of both parents and
  children in nutrition education; an important aspect was engaging the whole family
  in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Next, they reported engagement with community partners
  as key in building trust and relationships with this community. These paraprofessionals
  worked with schools, churches and migrant camps to deliver nutrition education to
  Hispanics/Latinos. Finally, nutrition education paraprofessionals perceived nutrition
  education as an empowerment tool for Hispanic/Latino families to improve their health
  and socially engaged. Conclusion: Paraprofessionals provide an advantage in delivering
  culturally-sensitive nutrition education to ethnically diverse communities such
  as Hispanics/Latinos. Their knowledge of the family dynamics and community resources
  demonstrates their ability to engage this community in a culturally sensitive manner.'
