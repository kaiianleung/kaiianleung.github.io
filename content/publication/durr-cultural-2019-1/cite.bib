 abstract = {Background: Food is a cultural symbol for Hispanics/Latinos, an ethnic group with high prevalence of diet-related diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports prevention of obesity and related diseases through nutrition education and lifestyle interventions delivered by paraprofessionals. This study examined cultural competency characteristics and cultural knowledge of paraprofessionals delivering a nutrition education intervention to low-income Hispanics/Latinos in an East South-Central state. Methods: A mixed-methods study with paraprofessionals was completed. A web-based, 42-item survey assessed demographics, cultural competency and diversity training in 76/. In-depth interviews about cultural knowledge and practices were completed with paraprofessionals providing nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos (n=8). Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Results: The majority of the respondents were non-Hispanic Whites (88.1%) and had completed diversity training (86.8%). The first theme reported for consideration in nutrition education for Hispanics/Latinos is the inclusion of both parents and children in nutrition education; an important aspect was engaging the whole family in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Next, they reported engagement with community partners as key in building trust and relationships with this community. These paraprofessionals worked with schools, churches and migrant camps to deliver nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos. Finally, nutrition education paraprofessionals perceived nutrition education as an empowerment tool for Hispanic/Latino families to improve their health and socially engaged. Conclusion: Paraprofessionals provide an advantage in delivering culturally-sensitive nutrition education to ethnically diverse communities such as Hispanics/Latinos. Their knowledge of the family dynamics and community resources demonstrates their ability to engage this community in a culturally sensitive manner.},
