abstract: "This qualitatively based research study aims at critically examining the
  linguistic practises of a particular group of Saudi parents who chose to use the
  host country's language (English L2) instead of the mother tongue (Arabic L1) with
  their children. Specifically, the study aims at answering two research questions:
  Why Saudi do parents chose to speak English to their child/children? And What are
  the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language:
  Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where
  semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis
  of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings
  from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children
  so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English
  â€“ L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their
  children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that
  children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss
  of their Arabic L1 language. The study concludes that parents should provide a linguistic
  balance for their bilingual children in order to preserve the native language. Additionally,
  the study recommends that further parallel research studies with bilingual children
  of various L1(s), are conducted."
