abstract: 'We evaluate brain structure sensitivity to verbal interference in a sentence
  interpretation task, building on previously reported evidence that those with better
  control of verbal interference show higher grey matter density in the posterior
  paravermis of the right cerebellum (Filippi et al., 2011). We compare brain structure
  sensitivity to verbal interference control across two groups, English monolingual
  (N = 41) and multilingual (N = 46) adults. Using voxel-based morphometry, our primary
  goal was to identify and explore differences in regional patterns of grey matter
  sensitivity to performance on the sentence interpretation task, controlling for
  group variability in age, nonverbal reasoning and vocabulary knowledge. There was
  no group difference in performance but there was a significant group effect in grey
  matter sensitivity to task performance in our region of interest: stronger sensitivity
  in the paravermis in bilinguals compared to monolinguals in accuracy performance
  in the high (relative to low) verbal interference condition. This effect was observed
  when the linguistic interference was presented in an unfamiliar language (Greek)
  but not when presented in the familiar language (English). Our findings suggest
  that multilanguage acquisition mediates regional involvement within the language
  network, conferring enhanced functional plasticity within structures (including
  the paravermis) in the service of control of linguistic interference.'
