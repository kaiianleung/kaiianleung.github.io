abstract: 'ISSUE ADDRESSED: There is strong evidence that physical activity and adequate
  nutrition are important protective factors against type 2 diabetes, but these are
  linked to culture and socio-economic status. This study explores the traditional
  culture of the Pukapuka people living in the Illawarra region of New South Wales
  and how migration to the region has affected their lifestyle, health and well-being.
  METHOD(S): The study used an action research approach, including focus groups, planning
  workshops, reflection sessions and collaborative evaluation of interventions. Twenty-four
  adults (13 women and 11 men) from the Pukapuka community were recruited. RESULT(S):
  Participants increased their understanding of the relationship between lifestyle
  and health status, increased rates of physical activity, and enhanced their sense
  of self-efficacy. CONCLUSION(S): The study shows that action research methods can
  be used effectively to influence behaviour changes in small, culturally and linguistically
  diverse communities.'
