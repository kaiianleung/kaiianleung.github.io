abstract: 'Although understanding the role of the environment is central to language
  acquisition theory, rarely has this been studied for children’s phonetic development;
  and receptive and expressive language experiences in the environment are not distinguished.
  This last distinction may be crucial for child speech production in particular because
  production requires coordination of low-level speech-motor planning with high-level
  linguistic knowledge. In this study, the role of the environment is evaluated in
  a novel way—by studying phonetic development in a bilingual community undergoing
  rapid language shift. This sociolinguistic context provides a naturalistic gradient
  of the amount of children’s exposure to two languages and the ratio of expressive
  to receptive experiences. A largescale child language corpus encompassing over 500
  hours of naturalistic South Bolivian Quechua and Spanish speech was efficiently
  annotated for children’s and their caregivers’ bilingual language use. These estimates
  were correlated with children’s patterns in a series of speech production tasks.
  The role of the environment varied by outcome: children’s expressive language experience
  best predicted their performance on a coarticulation-morphology measure while their
  receptive experience predicted performance on a lower-level measure of vowel variability.
  Overall these bilingual exposure effects suggest a pathway for children’s role in
  language change whereby language shift can result in different learning outcomes
  within a single speech community. Appropriate ways to model language exposure in
  development are discussed.'
