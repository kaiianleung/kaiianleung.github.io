 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older Chinese Americans have a disproportionately higher rate of undertreated hypertension (HTN) compared to non-Latino Whites, and Asian Americans report weaker patient-provider engagement than desired. As patient activation can be a powerful driver of improved HTN control, we assessed the efficacy of a culturally tailored clinical pharmacist intervention on patient activation among immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. METHOD(S): We conducted a pre-post, prospective intervention with repeated measures in Los Angeles County. We screened and recruited patients from 8 community health centers and private practice clinics between 2015-2016. Eligible patients (age 60+, medically insured, past year visit at study clinic, at least 2 of 3 systolic blood pressure [BP] readings above JNC-8 goal in past year) were invited to a study information session through mailings and telephone calls in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Enrolled participants had 3 visits within 3 months with bilingual study pharmacists, who were trained to elicit HTN explanatory models when providing HTN education and use motivational interviewing (MI) and shared decision-making (SDM) when counseling patients on lifestyle changes and BP medications. Study participants' physicians received a brief summary of each visit and signed pharmacist recommendations for medications or lab orders if in agreement. Participants completed baseline and final surveys before their first and after their last pharmacist visit, including demographic information and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). We also conducted chart reviews to obtain clinical information. We estimated a sample size of 50 patients would detect a clinically significant 3 to 5-point difference in our primary outcome, PAM scores, with 80% power. We tested for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULT(S): We screened 415 potential participants to enroll 50 immigrant Chinese American seniors who received the intervention. The average age was 71 years, and 23 (47%) were female. Participants had resided in the U.S. for an average of 30 years, but only 10 (20%) were comfortable speaking English. Median baseline level of trust in pharmacists was "somewhat" to "strongly trust". The mean baseline PAM score was 58.8 signifying "beginning to take action," with a mean change of -2.04 +/- 13.9 (p = 0.48) at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): While clinical pharmacist HTN interventions have shown success in some settings, our intervention utilizing MI and SDMstrategies was not associated with increases in PAM scores for immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. Despite strong project involvement of community partners in these predominantly Asian neighborhoods, eligible seniors frequently declined to enroll. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to identify other team-based care approaches which may be more appealing and successful at increasing patient activation for HTN control in this population.},
