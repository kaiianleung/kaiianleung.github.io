abstract: 'AIM: The aim of this study was to better understand the impact of non-English
  language spoken in the home on measures of cognition, language and behaviour in
  toddlers born extremely preterm., METHODS: Eight hundred and fifty children born
  at textless28 weeks of gestational ages were studied. 427 male and 423 female participants
  from three racial/ethnic groups (White, Black and Hispanic) were evaluated at 18-22
  months adjusted for age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development third edition
  and the Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA). Children whose
  primary language was Spanish (n = 98) were compared with children whose primary
  language was English (n = 752), using multivariable regression adjusted for medical
  and psychosocial factors., RESULTS: Cognitive scores were similar between groups;
  however, receptive, expressive and composite language scores were lower for children
  whose primary language was Spanish. These differences remained significant after
  adjustment for medical and socio-economic factors. Spanish-speaking children scored
  worse on the BITSEA competence and problem scores using univariate analysis, but
  not after adjustment for medical and socio-economic factors., CONCLUSION: Our finding
  that preterm children whose primary language was Spanish had similar cognitive but
  lower language scores than those whose primary language was English suggests that
  using English language-based testing tools may introduce bias against non-English-speaking
  children born preterm. Copyright Â©2013 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by
