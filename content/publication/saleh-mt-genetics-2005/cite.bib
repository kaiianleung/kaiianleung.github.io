 abstract = {To provide equitable genetics education services, the needs of a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population must be addressed. The mission of the Centre for Genetics Education (CGE) in Australia articulates a commitment to fostering community partnerships, implementing educational strategies and evaluating the impact of genetics information and technology on society. The aim of this report is to review the ways in which CALD groups have been partners in the planning and implementation of genetics educational strategies of the Centre. Responding to the community and respecting its contribution has helped forge these partnerships and implement appropriate and relevant educational strategies. The partnerships have been effective in modulating both the protocols used in producing resources, the resource content itself, and the provision of more appropriately targeted resources for these community groups.
