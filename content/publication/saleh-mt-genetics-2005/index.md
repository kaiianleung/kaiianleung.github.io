abstract: To provide equitable genetics education services, the needs of a culturally
  and linguistically diverse (CALD) population must be addressed. The mission of the
  Centre for Genetics Education (CGE) in Australia articulates a commitment to fostering
  community partnerships, implementing educational strategies and evaluating the impact
  of genetics information and technology on society. The aim of this report is to
  review the ways in which CALD groups have been partners in the planning and implementation
  of genetics educational strategies of the Centre. Responding to the community and
  respecting its contribution has helped forge these partnerships and implement appropriate
  and relevant educational strategies. The partnerships have been effective in modulating
  both the protocols used in producing resources, the resource content itself, and
  the provision of more appropriately targeted resources for these community groups.
