 abstract = {Background: The issue of domestic violence (DV) in the Australian Community is one of significant concern. and the Indian community of Victoria, Australia is no exception. One in three women suffer DV and there appears to be a distinct lack of culturally sensitive data to guide current domestic violence services. Further, DV is an eminently preventable cause of many mental illnesses, including high suicide rates and psychosomatic illnesses. This social qualitative study sought to gather culturally sensitive data to guide services and prevention strategies campaigns in the Victorian Indian Population. Indian is a collectivist society, commonly employs defence mechanisms such as denial, avoidance, shame, fear of social opprobrium, need for conformity, making it a taboo to speak freely about issues such as DV. To by-pass cultural defence mechanism, we decided to use modified Forum Theatre under the direction of a theatre director. Method(s): Women from Indian populated areas in Melbourne took part in this community-action research. Phase 1 - 3 Focus groups discussions. Phase 2-Script was created from themes of focus group discussions. Phase 3 - Women volunteered as actors for modified Forum Theatre (Boal 2004, Sleip 2004). Phase 4 - Enacted with interactive audience participation. All key conversations were audio recorded and anlysed with qualitative statistical tools. Result(s): 70 women took part in Focus group discussions. A further 120-130 women took part in four theater productions. Rich data regarding social drivers of DV in Australian Indian homes, silence on the topic, taboos and barriers to using DV services obtained. Conclusion(s): Modified Forum Theater yielded useful new data to guide treatment and prevention strategies for DV in Australian Indian population. The findings of this study can be generalized to some extent to other collectivist societies.},
