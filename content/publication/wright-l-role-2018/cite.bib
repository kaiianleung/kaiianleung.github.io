 abstract = {Purpose of study Racial/ethnic health disparities are preventable differences in health outcomes between different races/ethnicities that are closely linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages. Geography continues to be a predictor of health disparities where infant mortality and chronic health outcomes appear to be intensified in high poverty tract areas in which African Americans and Latinos tend to live, compared to poor non-Hispanic whites. Watts is perpetually constructed as an under-resourced neighbourhood of Los Angeles where residents experience the poorest health. Resources and community health fairs have been identified as effective approaches to reach residents, ensuring health screenings, resource sharing, and gathering data. The primary objective of this study was to provide basic screenings and resources, while assess effectiveness of the fair and gather residents' healthrelated seeking behaviours to identify community-driven strategies to improve overall health. Methods used Using community based participatory research, this study developed and administered a bilingual survey to capture residents' perspectives on the effectiveness of the fair, personal health seeking behaviours, and suggestions to improve health and wellbeing in the community. The surveys were deidentified and coded for frequency analysis of responses using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Summary of results Of the 200 attendees, 107 completed the survey: 71 Latinos, 28 African Americans, 73 Females, 26 Males, 31 between the ages of 36-45, and 51 with a household income under \$15 000. Respondents determined their primary reason for attending was health screenings and identified transportation as a barrier to making their doctor's appointment. The park and library were resources accessed the most, and community-driven recommendations included nutritional education and more health fairs. Conclusions Resources and health fairs in low-income communities serve as immediate approaches for low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. However, health fairs are not able to follow-up with most participants and may be inconsistent. Therefore, large-scale interventions should address limitations to ensure wellbeing in these areas.},
