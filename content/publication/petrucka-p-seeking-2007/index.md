abstract: The Southern Saskatchewan/Urban Aboriginal Health Coalition is an interdisciplinary,
  intersectoral team of researchers and communities dedicated to exploring culturally
  respectful care in Aboriginal communities. Through a community-based research approach,
  the communities and the Coalition used sharing circles to determine the key elements
  that 2 Saskatchewan Aboriginal communities see as requisite for culturally competent
  care. Through triangulation and thematic analysis, 9 initial themes and 4 broad
  thematic groupings were derived.The lessons from this study could inform further
  research with these communities and other culturally diverse groups with respect
  to cultural competency in terms of both health-care providers and health services.
