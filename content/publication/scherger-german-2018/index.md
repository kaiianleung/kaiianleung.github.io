abstract: This study explores the role of German dative case marking in disentangling
  effects of specific language impairment (SLI) and bilingualism. Longitudinal data
  of German-Italian bilingual children with SLI (N=3) is compared to cross-sectional
  data (N=42) of monolingual and bilingual typically developing (TD) children and
  monolingual children with SLI (ages four and seven). Spontaneous and elicited speech
  data is analysed in terms of target-like dative case marking in German. Results
  show differences between the acquisition of case marking of pronouns and of full
  Determiner Phrases (DPs). Regarding the target-like dative case marking in total,
  there were no differences found between bilingual TD, monolingual and bilingual
  children with SLI by the age of four. They demonstrated a similar delay when compared
  to monolingual TD children. By the age of seven, however, bilingual TD children
  'catch up' with their monolingual peers. Children with SLI do not master the acquisition
  of dative case marking by this age. Cumulative effects of bilingualism and SLI were
  not found neither in younger nor in older bilingual children. These findings underline
  the importance of further research on linguistic markers and of distinguishing between
  effects of SLI and bilingualism. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
