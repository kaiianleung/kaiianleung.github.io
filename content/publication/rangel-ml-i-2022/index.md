abstract: Latino day laborers (LDLs) are at a high risk for injury and accidents at
  work and have limited socioeconomic resources to deal with their consequences. While
  little is known about LDLs' perceptions of their own vulnerability at the workplace,
  less is known about the strategies they adopt to confront these risks. The purpose
  of this qualitative study was to assess LDLs' perceptions of their workplace dangers
  and to document the strategies they adopt and endorse to confront them. Guided by
  a participatory research approach, four focus groups stratified by age were conducted
  with 34 LDLs in Houston, Texas. Main focus group themes were identified using a
  combination of qualitative analysis methods involving a thematic analysis conducted
  by the interview team, LDL advisors, and bilingual Latino researchers. All participants
  were Latino males (mean age = 40), the majority reported having completed sixth
  grade or less (64.2%) and having lived in the United States for an average of 12.7
  years. We described three categories of strategies to reduce risk for workplace
  injury generated by local LDLs (practical knowledge and job experience, interpersonal,
  and personal). These strategies should be explored and encouraged to assist in planning
  risk-reduction programs, presented in the voice and language of Latino \"inside
  experts\" with firsthand experience. The findings of the focus group suggest that
  LDLs already possess a broad repertoire of strategies to cope with risks at work
  that can be incorporated in safety programs for LDLs and other immigrant Latino
  workers.
