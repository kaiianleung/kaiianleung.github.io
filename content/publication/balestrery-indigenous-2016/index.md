abstract: 'Indigenous peoples around the world endure health and social disparities.
  In the United States, such disparities are typically ameliorated through conventional
  care services and organizations. Purpose: To examine points of tension that characterize
  culturally pluralistic care services in the United States, specifically Alaska,
  within context of Indigenous colonial histories. Design and Methods: The research
  design is ethnographic and multisited, comprising 12 months of fieldwork across
  urban, rural and remote village sites in Alaska. A conceptual lens that accounts
  for culturally diverse social spaces where relations of power are at stake frames
  research presented here. This work incorporates relational and participatory action
  research principles with Alaska Native Elders. Ethnographic evidence was collected
  through multiple methods, including field notes, documents, and interviews, with
  ethnographic analysis involving atlas.ti. Findings: Alaska Native Elders describe
  salient points of tension characterizing Alaska’s conventional care services through
  the following insights:generational curses-—a pain,prejudice on both sides—wounded,
  andvalue-systems clash—fighting. Conclusion: This article concludes with discussion
  about collective anxieties and implications for care services.'
