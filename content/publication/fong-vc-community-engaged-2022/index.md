abstract: "This study adopted a community-engaged approach to explore Korean parents'
  perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing autism services in British
  Columbia, Canada. Understanding the experiences of culturally and linguistically
  diverse families and their children may help facilitate the development of more
  inclusive, appropriate, and culturally sensitive services. Semi-structured interviews
  with 20 Korean parents of autistic children were analyzed using a thematic approach.
  Barriers and facilitators at the system, provider, and family/cultural level were
  identified. Barriers at the system level included delays and waitlists for services,
  and ineffective school policies to address child behavioral challenges. At the provider
  level, barriers included a lack of qualified professionals, negative attitudes,
  and lack of guidance navigating services. For family/cultural-related barriers,
  language and communication difficulties, out-of-pocket costs, and stigma impeded
  service access. Facilitators at the system level included family-centered care and
  prioritization of mental health supports. At the provider level, strengths included
  culturally competent and bilingual professionals. The family/cultural-related facilitators
  identified were informal support networks, characteristics of the parent, and connections
  to cultural community organizations. The findings emphasize the need to understand
  and consider diverse experiences, preferences, and values in the design and provision
  of autism services for families and their children. Lay abstract: Perceptions and
  experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse groups in accessing autism
  services in Canada are extremely limited. Thus, this study partnered with a community
  member to explore Korean immigrant parents' perceptions of barriers and facilitators
  to accessing autism services in British Columbia, Canada. Interviews were conducted
  with 20 Korean parents of autistic children. Barriers and facilitators at the system,
  provider, and family/cultural level were identified. Barriers at the system level
  included delays and waitlists for services, and ineffective school policies to address
  child behavioral challenges. At the provider level, barriers included a lack of
  qualified professionals, negative attitudes, and lack of guidance navigating services.
  For family/cultural-related barriers, these included language and communication
  difficulties, out-of-pocket costs, and stigma impeded service access. Facilitators
  at the system level included family-centered care and prioritization of mental health
  supports. At the provider level, strengths included culturally competent and bilingual
  professionals. The family/cultural-related facilitators identified were informal
  support networks, characteristics of the parent, and connections to cultural community
  organizations. The findings emphasize the need to understand and consider diverse
  experiences, preferences, and values in the design and provision of autism services
  for families and their children.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021."
