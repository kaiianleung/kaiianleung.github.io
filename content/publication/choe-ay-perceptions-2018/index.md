abstract: 'Purpose: The racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population has undergone
  significant changes with Asian Pacific Islanders being the fastest growing population.
  Furthermore, the number of immigrant children has doubled in the past two decades,
  and a quarter of U.S. children are estimated to have at least one foreign-born parent.
  Despite such increases in immigrant populations and ethnic diversity, the current
  literature focuses primarily on African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, with analyses
  of health inequalities among recent ethnic and immigrant groups from Asia relatively
  uncommon. Compared to their white counterparts, Korean children are more likely
  to be rated by parents to be in fair or poor health, to lack health insurance, and
  to have had no well child, even after adjusting for socioeconomic differences in
  both children and adults. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify
  barriers and enabling factors that influence healthcare access and utilization in
  pediatric population of Korean descent in an urban Midwest community. Method(s):
  The current study used qualitative methods to explore the experiences of Korean
  parents and their understanding and use of the healthcare system for their children.
  Four focus groups were conducted in the language of their preference. A semi-structured
  facilitator-guide was used to guide questions on cultural influences on health care
  decisions and interactions and utilization of health services. Data were analyzed
  using grounded theory methodology. Using NVIVO, the researchers coded and identified
  recurring themes. A model will be developed to characterize the findings. Result(s):
  Themes focused on language barriers in health care interactions, including a lack
  of knowledge of interpreter services, poor quality of such services, and variability
  in physician inquiry regarding the need for such services. Among participants who
  previously lived in Korea, a theme arose concerning barriers and frustration of
  obtaining healthcare secondary to perceived healthcare costs, longer wait-times
  involved in scheduling as well as during appointments, and lack of physician understanding
  on common Korean home remedies. Parents also reffected on the difference in healthcare
  between Korean and the United States systems with many aspects felt to be more easily
  obtainable in Korea. Another theme centered on the participants understanding of
  primary care as it relates to the importance of anticipatory guidance, attainment
  of well-child checks, and utilization of immediate care facilities. Parents discussed
  their dependence on friends and community-based organization as the primary source
  of medical information. Conclusion(s): Korean children may experience unique barriers
  to health care access. These findings merit additional research to further examine
  these barriers and establish quality improvement efforts within the community. Community
  resources aimed to empower ethnically and linguistically diverse population as well
  as a more nuanced and inquisitive cultural competency training within healthcare
  system are needed.'
