abstract: The literature regarding the prevention of diabetes provides few standards
  for community-based initiatives. The present article offers four principles for
  engaging communities in comprehensive community approaches to diabetes prevention
  including (1) facilitating meaningful and central roles for communities, (2) giving
  primary attention to participatory processes rather than to best practices, (3)
  emphasizing cultural relevance in designing interventions particularly in racial
  and ethnic communities, and (4) incorporating social ecology approaches that are
  holistic and that address larger environmental influences rather than individual
  behavioral change alone. In order that community public health practitioners may
  operationalize the principles, models are provided for each. Â© 2006 Lippincott Williams
