abstract: 'Study objective: Individuals in neighborhoods composed of minority and
  lower socioeconomic status populations are more likely to have an out-of-hospital
  cardiac arrest event, less likely to have bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
  (CPR) performed, and less likely to survive. Latino cardiac arrest victims are 30%
  less likely than whites to have bystander CPR performed. The goal of this study
  is to identify barriers and facilitators to calling 911, and learning and performing
  CPR in 5 low-income, Latino neighborhoods in Denver, CO. Method(s): Six focus groups
  and 9 key informant interviews were conducted in Denver during the summer of 2012.
  Purposeful and snowball sampling, conducted by community liaisons, was used to recruit
  participants. Two reviewers analyzed the data to identify recurrent and unifying
  themes. A qualitative content analysis was used with a 5-stage iterative process
  to analyze each transcript. Result(s): Six key barriers to calling 911 were identified:
  fear of becoming involved because of distrust of law enforcement, financial, immigration
  status, lack of recognition of cardiac arrest event, language, and violence. Seven
  cultural barriers were identified that may preclude performance of bystander CPR:
  age, sex, immigration status, language, racism, strangers, and fear of touching
  someone. Participants suggested that increasing availability of tailored education
  in Spanish, increasing the number of bilingual 911 dispatchers, and policy-level
  changes, including CPR as a requirement for graduation and strengthening Good Samaritan
  laws, may serve as potential facilitators in increasing the provision of bystander
  CPR. Conclusion(s): Distrust of law enforcement, language concerns, lack of recognition
  of cardiac arrest, and financial issues must be addressed when community-based CPR
  educational programs for Latinos are implemented.Copyright Â© 2014 American College
