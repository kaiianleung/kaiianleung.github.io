abstract: 'Objective: We describe the development, translation and validation of epilepsy-screening
  questionnaires in the three most popular Nigerian languages: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.
  Method(s): A 9-item epilepsy-screening questionnaire was developed by modifying
  previously validated English language questionnaires. Separate multilingual experts
  forward- and back-translated them to the three target languages. Translations were
  discussed with fieldworkers and community members for ethnolinguistic acceptability
  and comprehension. We used an unmatched affected-case versus unaffected-control
  design for the pilot study. Cases were people with epilepsy attending the tertiary
  hospitals where these languages are spoken. The controls were relatives of cases
  or people attending for other medical conditions. An affirmative response to any
  of the nine questions amounted to a positive screen for epilepsy. Result(s): We
  recruited 153 (75 cases and 78 controls) people for the Hausa version, 106 (45 cases
  and 61 controls) for Igbo and 153 (66 cases and 87 controls) for the Yoruba. The
  sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire were: Hausa (97.3% and 88.5%),
  Igbo (91.1% and 88.5%) and Yoruba (93.9% and 86.7%). The three versions reliably
  indicated epilepsy with positive predictive values of 85.9% (Hausa), 85.4% (Igbo)
  and 87.3% (Yoruba) and reliably excluded epilepsy with negative predictive values
  of 97.1% (Hausa), 93.1% (Igbo) and 95.1% (Yoruba). Positive likelihood ratios were
  all greater than one. Conclusion(s): Validated epilepsy screening questionnaires
  are now available for the three languages to be used for community-based epilepsy
  survey in Nigeria. The translation and validation process are discussed to facilitate
  usage and development for other languages in sub-Saharan Africa.Copyright Â© 2020
