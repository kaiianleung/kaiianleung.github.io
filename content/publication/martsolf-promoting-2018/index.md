abstract: In this study, we explore the experiences of innovative nurses who have
  developed cross-sector collaborations toward promoting a culture of health, with
  the aim of identifying lessons that can inform similar efforts of other health care
  professionals. We used a mixed-methods approach based on data from both an online
  survey and telephone interviews. A majority of the participants had significant
  collaborations with health care providers and non–health care providers. Strong
  partners included mental health providers, specialists, and primary care providers
  on the health side, and for non–health partners, the strongest collaborations were
  with community leaders, research institutions, and local businesses. Themes that
  emerged for successful collaborations included having to be embedded in both the
  community and in institutions of power, ensuring that a shared vision and language
  with all partners are established, and leading with strength and tenacity. A focus
  on building a culture of health will grow as payment policy moves away from fee-for-service
  toward models that focus on incentivizing population health. Effective efforts to
  promote a culture of health require cross-sector collaborations that draw on long-term,
  trusting relationships among leaders. Health care practitioners can be important
  leaders and “bridgers” in collaborations, but they must possess or develop the knowledge,
  attitudes, and skills of “bilingual” facilitators, partners, and “relationship builders.”
