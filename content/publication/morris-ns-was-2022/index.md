abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Immigrants experience barriers to accessing and utilizing health
  care. Language and cultural differences regarding health and healing impact use
  of health care. Limited health literacy is associated with decreased preventive
  health services and is reported among immigrant groups in the USA, but the health
  literacy of African immigrants is not known. OBJECTIVE(S): Assess health literacy,
  its association with engagement in primary care and select sociodemographic variables,
  and the use of two health literacy measures with African immigrants. METHOD(S):
  We conducted a community-based participatory research cross-sectional survey among
  African immigrants in Massachusetts. Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign,
  the Health Literacy Skills Instrument, acceptability questionnaires, and a Health
  Survey. We observed and recorded comments and questions as participants completed
  the surveys. KEY RESULTS: Out of 75 participants, 60% have limited health literacy.
  Over 80% are connected to a health care system and comfortable speaking with their
  doctor/nurse. Education, English proficiency, country of origin, and access to health
  care are associated with health literacy. Participants found the measures easy to
  understand but difficult to answer. Observation data revealed unfamiliarity with
  nutrition labels, cooking measurements, and navigation of internet links, and the
  need for clarification of select items. CONCLUSION(S): Most African immigrants in
  this study have limited health literacy despite English proficiency, college education,
  employment, and connection to a health system. Further research is needed to determine
  the value of aligning the measurement of health literacy with the cultural-linguistic
  identities of the population being assessed versus the need to understand their
  health literacy within the dominant culture.Copyright Â© 2021. W. Montague Cobb-NMA
