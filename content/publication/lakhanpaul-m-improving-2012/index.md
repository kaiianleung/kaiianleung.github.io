abstract: "Background South Asian Children present more frequently than White British
  Children to emergency departments with acute asthma: tailored interventions may
  redress this. The Management Interventions for Asthma project (MIA) assessed the
  feasibility of involving adults, parents and children from this potentially 'hard
  to reach' ethnic community alongside healthcare professionals (HCPs) in prioritising
  components for tailored asthma interventions. Methods Eleven issues identified as
  barriers to asthma management following interviews with community members, parents,
  children and HCPs were presented at community based events by the MIA team utilising
  interpreters/facilitators for simultaneous 5-way translation. HCPs were sent information
  electronically. Forty six community members, 22 parents, 19 children and 13 HCPs
  used Borda ranking to prioritise the issues for subsequent development of interventions
  in the current health care system. Results Getting a diagnosis was ranked first
  by parents and community members but last by HCPs. Language barriers were ranked
  first by HCPs. Children prioritised managing acute asthma attacks. Conclusions Ethnicity
  and language need not be barriers to involving South Asian families in health services
  research. It is crucial to include community members, families and children in the
  development of tailored interventions as well as HCPs. Relying on HCPs alone could
  lead to key issues being missed or priorities misjudged."
