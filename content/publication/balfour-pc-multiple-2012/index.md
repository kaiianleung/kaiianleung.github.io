abstract: 'Background: Heart Failure is a complex syndrome with numerous patho-physiological
  mechanisms and altered biomarker profiles. Biomarkers that indicate risk for incident
  HF are less well established. Objective(s): To evaluate the predictive role of biomarkers
  reflecting different patho-physiological pathways for prediction of HF in the Multi-Ethnic
  Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large multi-ethnic community based cohort. Method(s):
  We evaluated 6,814 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese participants
  with mean age 62.3 +/- 10.3 (51.4% female). We examined individual and joint associations
  of CRP, fibrinogen, NT-proBNP, homocysteine, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio
  (UACR) with incident HF using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for age,
  sex, ethnicity, systolic BP, antihypertensive therapy, smoking, diabetes, total
  cholesterol, BMI, left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, and estimated glomerular
  filtration rate. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated per 1-SD change in log (biomarker).
  A multivariable-adjusted stepwise procedure (p for retention textless 0.05) was
  used to determine the independent contributions of the biomarkers for prediction
  of HF. We examined the increased model discriminative value with calculation of
  the C-statistic. Net reclassification index (NRI) was calculated with participants
  stratified in 3 risk categories; low (10%). Result(s): During median follow-up of
  7.6 years, 176 participants developed HF. In multivariable-adjusted models, 3 of
  5 biomarkers were individually associated with HF; NT-proBNP, CRP, and UACR [HRs:
  2.46, (95% CI 2.11-2.87), 1.28 (1.09-1.50), and 1.29 (1.14-1.45), respectively].
  After stepwise selection only NT-proBNP [HR: 2.56 (95% CI 2.17-3.03)] and CRP [HR:
  1.20 (95% CI 1.03-1.41)] remained statistically significant. The C-statistic significantly
  increased when NT-proBNP and CRP were added to the model (0.864 vs. 0.808). The
  addition of biomarkers improved NRI (NRI 0.29, p textless0.0001). Conclusion(s):
  CRP and NT-proBNP are significant independent predictors and substantially improve
  risk classification for incident heart failure. More research is warranted to determine
  the clinical utility of measuring these biomarkers in subjects at risk for incident
  heart failure.'
