abstract: The presence of Latinos in Virginia is a new phenomenon and as a result,
  less is known about the health needs of these newest community members. We formed
  a community-university partnership to identify health concerns and service needs
  as they relate to Latino youth living in Richmond, Virginia and the surrounding
  area. Using a mixed-method approach, survey data was obtained from 212 Latino adults,
  qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 community leaders and focus groups
  with 23 Latino parents (16 mothers, 7 fathers) and 6 Latino boys. Participants expressed
  concern about sexually transmitted infections/pregnancy among youth (76%), youth
  behavior problems at home/school (75%), and mental health problems (75%). Participants
  also expressed worry that youth would lose their connection to their Latin culture
  (83%). Qualitative data provided more information regarding these concerns by linking
  them with inter-ethnic tensions, and immigration and acculturation-related stressors.
  Survey participants also indicated a need for bilingual mental health services (88%)
  and after-school programs for youth (94%). This study provided the local community
  with information on the health concerns and service needs of a new group of community
  youth-Latino youth. Findings were presented to local community and City organizations
  that used the information to respond to the identified needs and/or concerns. The
  process in which the data was obtained may prove useful to other individuals interested
  in obtaining local level health information in emerging communities. Â© 2009 Springer
