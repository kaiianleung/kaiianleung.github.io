abstract: The free, telephone-based Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service (GHS)
  has made sustained improvements in healthy behaviours and weight change in the Australian
  population, but there is poor uptake of the GHS by culturally and linguistically
  diverse communities. This formative research study explored the Australian-Chinese
  community's awareness, perceptions and experiences of the GHS and their knowledge
  and cultural beliefs about healthy lifestyles. Conducted in Sydney, Australia, the
  research included 16 Chinese community-stakeholder interviews, a cross-sectional
  survey of 253 Chinese community members; and a review of Chinese participant GHS
  data. The study revealed poor uptake (textless1%) and awareness (16%) of the GHS,
  but good intent (86%) to use it. The need for culturally appropriate and relevant
  information on healthy eating and physical activity was identified. Employment of
  a bilingual, bicultural coach, redesign and translation of written resources and
  targeted promotion in partnership with community organisations were recommended.Copyright
