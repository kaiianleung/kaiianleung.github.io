abstract: 'Contemporary health promotion is underpinned by a philosophy of participation
  and working with communities to build strength and capacity. This article adds to
  literature, describing how this is operationalised in health promotion research.
  The operationalisation of participation and equality in a participatory action research
  (PAR) project examining domestic violence in five communities from an African refugee
  background, post settlement in Perth (Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and
  Sudan) is described. The qualitative research undertaken included 78 participants:
  54 from the five communities and 24 from health and support agency staff who provide
  services to them and utilised in-depth interviews and focus groups. Ongoing participation
  by community members and equality within stakeholder relationships was facilitated
  by the project being community-initiated, the crystallisation of strong stakeholder
  relationships, data collection by trained bicultural, bilingual interviewers from
  the five communities, and ongoing involvement of the communities through data analysis
  and report-writing phases. All stakeholders are able to learn from the perspectives
  and knowledge of others. Equality can supplant a subject-object relationship typical
  of much research and evident in some practice, with a subject-subject relationship.
  It can also transpose community members from the margins to the centre of research
  and practice. How community strength and capacity can be built through research
  is instructive for health promotion practice.'
