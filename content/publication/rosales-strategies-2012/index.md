abstract: A pressing need exists to include Latinas in cancer prevention research
  and to promote the value of early screening to prevent breast cancer. However, several
  challenges impede engaging Spanish-speaking Latinas in research. This chapter focuses
  on the recruitment process undertaken to secure participants for two breast cancer
  prevention education studies. Spanish-speaking Latinas were recruited for both studies.
  Data collection took place at community-organized events tailored to Latino communities.
  Emphasis is placed on recruitment strategies used that follow community-based participatory
  research (CBPR) principles. We report several strategies utilized to contact and
  motivate Latinas to participate in research seeking to better understand factors
  that influence their breast cancer screening behaviors. We present recruitment strategies
  that were tailored to the target population, helped develop participants' trust
  and engaged the community and that were successful in encouraging and increasing
  research participation. Factors that challenge the recruitment of ethnic minorities
  in community settings call for flexible and culturally sensitive and culturally
  appropriate recruitment strategies. By utilizing strategies that follow CBPR principles,
  we took necessary steps to successfully recruit. Latinas into cancer prevention
  education research studies conducted in community settings. These strategies may
  serve as a viable solution for addressing barriers to research participation.
