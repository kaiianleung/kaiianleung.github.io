 abstract = {A pressing need exists to include Latinas in cancer prevention research and to promote the value of early screening to prevent breast cancer. However, several challenges impede engaging Spanish-speaking Latinas in research. This chapter focuses on the recruitment process undertaken to secure participants for two breast cancer prevention education studies. Spanish-speaking Latinas were recruited for both studies. Data collection took place at community-organized events tailored to Latino communities. Emphasis is placed on recruitment strategies used that follow community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles. We report several strategies utilized to contact and motivate Latinas to participate in research seeking to better understand factors that influence their breast cancer screening behaviors. We present recruitment strategies that were tailored to the target population, helped develop participants' trust and engaged the community and that were successful in encouraging and increasing research participation. Factors that challenge the recruitment of ethnic minorities in community settings call for flexible and culturally sensitive and culturally appropriate recruitment strategies. By utilizing strategies that follow CBPR principles, we took necessary steps to successfully recruit. Latinas into cancer prevention education research studies conducted in community settings. These strategies may serve as a viable solution for addressing barriers to research participation.},
