 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of a short-duration, culturally tailored, community-based diabetes self- management program (CTCDSP) for Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes delivered at a non-clinic-affiliated community center. Method(s): Forty-one Korean adults with type 2 diabetes participated in a 2-session CTCDSP delivered by a bilingual nurse practitioner at a Korean community center. Outcome measures included biological, behavioral, and general health well-being; diabetes knowledge; and self-efficacy assessed at baseline, post-education, and 3-month follow-up. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to explore mean differences in outcomes across the 3 assessment points. Result(s): From baseline to 3-month follow-up assessment, participants exhibited significant improvement on several physiological and behavioral measures. Mean levels of hemoglobin A1c and waist circumference decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein levels increased. Additionally, participants reported an increase in weekly feet checks, and there was a trend increase in participants' reported frequency of exercise activities. The feasibility of the CTCDSP was established, and participant satisfaction with the program was high. Conclusion(s): A short-duration CTCDSP may be an effective, feasible, and favorably received approach to improving diabetes outcomes in Korean and potentially other underserved ethnic minority immigrants who have limited access to mainstream clinic-based diabetes self-management programs. © 2012 The Author(s).},
