abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effectiveness,
  feasibility, and acceptability of a short-duration, culturally tailored, community-based
  diabetes self- management program (CTCDSP) for Korean immigrants with type 2 diabetes
  delivered at a non-clinic-affiliated community center. Method(s): Forty-one Korean
  adults with type 2 diabetes participated in a 2-session CTCDSP delivered by a bilingual
  nurse practitioner at a Korean community center. Outcome measures included biological,
  behavioral, and general health well-being; diabetes knowledge; and self-efficacy
  assessed at baseline, post-education, and 3-month follow-up. Repeated-measures analyses
  of variance were used to explore mean differences in outcomes across the 3 assessment
  points. Result(s): From baseline to 3-month follow-up assessment, participants exhibited
  significant improvement on several physiological and behavioral measures. Mean levels
  of hemoglobin A1c and waist circumference decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein
  levels increased. Additionally, participants reported an increase in weekly feet
  checks, and there was a trend increase in participants' reported frequency of exercise
  activities. The feasibility of the CTCDSP was established, and participant satisfaction
  with the program was high. Conclusion(s): A short-duration CTCDSP may be an effective,
  feasible, and favorably received approach to improving diabetes outcomes in Korean
  and potentially other underserved ethnic minority immigrants who have limited access
  to mainstream clinic-based diabetes self-management programs. Â© 2012 The Author(s)."
