 abstract = {Context Suggested benefits of periodic health examinations (PHEs) include opportunities for screening, health promotion, and fostering the doctor-patient relationship. The literature contains little about the PHE from the patients' perspective. Objective To explore patients' feelings about, and experience with, the PHE. Design Quantitative, participatory. Participants English- or French-speaking patients aged 18 or older, receiving at least 1 PHE within the previous 24 months. A random sample of patients of an urban, hospital-based academic family medicine centre was approached by volunteers (themselves patients of that centre) to self-administer a piloted, bilingual, anonymous 24-item survey on perceptions of and experiences with "an annual exam, complete checkup, or periodic health exam," as distinct from a visit for a new problem or follow-up of an existing one. Main outcome measures Likert-style questions exploring patients' experiences with PHEs were predominantly derived from 4 validated tools: the National Survey Programme, the Patient Experience Questionnaire, the Recovery Self-Assessment Person in Recovery survey, and the Recovery Oriented Systems Indicators Consumer Survey 2005. Results Of 196 patients agreeing to participate, 173 were retained in the final data set: 78.6% were female; the mean age was 48.4 years; mean years of care by the same doctor was 5.1; mean number of visits in the preceding 24 months was 4.9. More than 90% agreed or strongly agreed that their doctors respected them, listened, and informed them in a clear fashion. Overall 80% to 90% agreed or strongly agreed that their doctors were open to options for care, had concern about both medical and psychosocial issues, and recognized their rights to express worries and concerns, or refuse interventions. In total, 62.5% agreed or strongly agreed that a purpose of PHE visits was to help doctors know them better as people, while only 39.3% agreed that a purpose was for them to get to know the doctors better. Conclusion Patients identified indicators of care suggesting high patient-centredness. Yet only 3 out of 5 endorsed PHEs as important for doctors to get to know them, and fewer (2 out of 5) saw such visits as opportunities for them to get to know the doctors. Patients might not appreciate what might be necessary to foster meaningful doctorpatient encounters.},
