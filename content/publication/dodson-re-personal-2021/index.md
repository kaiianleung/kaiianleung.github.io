abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Personal care product use may contribute to elevated body burdens
  of consumer product chemicals among women of color; however, racial/ethnic differences
  in product use has been understudied. Community-engaged research can support the
  recruitment of diverse participants. OBJECTIVE(S): To document personal care product
  use among a diverse group of women (aged 18-34 years) living in California. METHOD(S):
  Through a community-academic partnership, we surveyed 357 women in California about
  product use information for 54 cosmetic, hair, menstrual/intimate care, and leave-on
  and rinse-off personal care products. We compared type and frequency of product
  use among Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, and White women. We also summarized use
  of scented products and reasons women select products. RESULT(S): Women reported
  using a median of 8 products daily, with some women reporting up to 30 products
  daily. Hispanic/Latinx and Asian women used more cosmetics, and Black women used
  more hair and menstrual/intimate products than other women. Of the 54 products compared,
  there were significant differences in use by race/ethnicity for 28 products, with
  the largest number of significant differences between Black and White women. SIGNIFICANCE:
  There is growing information on chemical exposures from personal care products and
  consequent adverse health effects, with implications for health disparities. Yet,
  there remains limited information on the range and types of products used by diverse
  racial/ethnic communities. This study helps close an important gap on product use
  inventories that can enable more informed public health interventions to limit exposures
  from personal care products.'
