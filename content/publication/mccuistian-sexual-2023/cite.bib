 abstract = {Background: Racial/ethnic minorities (REMs) continue to carry the burden of sexual health disparities in the United States, including increased health risks and lower proportions of preventative care. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been useful in developing interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Specifically, partnership with the target group members has resulted in more culturally relevant intervention strategies. Aim: The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the existing research on sexual health interventions targeting U.S. REMs that were developed using CBPR, to highlight the role target group members played in the development of these interventions, and to explore the benefits and outcomes of these partnerships. Method: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the search of 46 thesauri terms for CBPR, sexual health, and REMs across six databases. Results: The initial search yielded 805 identified studies. After applying limiters, reviewing abstracts, and doing a full-text review, 24 appropriate studies were retained. The key findings indicated significant intervention outcomes such as increased health knowledge, attitude change, and behavioral intention that could reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors. Twelve studies detailed the methods for partnering with target group members to formulate interventions, highlighting the benefits related to recruitment, retention, and cultural relevance. Discussion: CBPR is well-positioned to address sexual health disparities among REMs. While community partnership strategies vary, the findings yield evidence that CBPR addressing sexual health disparities is achievable, can influence the effectiveness of interventions, and should be considered as an orientation in future sexual health research.},
