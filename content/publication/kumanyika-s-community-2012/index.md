abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Increases in the availability, affordability, and promotion
  of high-calorie foods and beverages and decreased obligations for routine physical
  activity have fostered trends of increased obesity worldwide. In high-income, plural
  societies, above average obesity prevalence is often observed in ethnic minority
  communities, suggesting that obesity-promoting influences are more prevalent or
  potent in these communities. METHODS: An interdisciplinary group of scholars engaged
  in multiple rounds of focused discussion and literature review to develop a Community
  Energy Balance Framework (CEB). The objective was to explore the nature of the excess
  obesity risk in African descent and other ethnic minority populations and identify
  related implications for planning and evaluating interventions to prevent obesity.
  RESULTS: A key principle that emerged is that researchers and programmers working
  with ethnic minority communities should contextualize the food- and physical activity-related
  sociocultural perspectives of these communities, taking into account relevant historical,
  political, and structural contexts. This perspective underscores the fallacy of
  approaches that place the entire burden of change on the individual, particularly
  in circumstances of social disadvantage and rapid cultural shifts. CONCLUSION: The
  CEB framework is proposed for use and further development to aid in understanding
  potential health-adverse effects of cultural-contextual stresses and accommodations
  to these stresses.'
