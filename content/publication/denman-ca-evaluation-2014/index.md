abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Meta Salud is a community health worker-facilitated intervention
  in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, and was adapted from Pasos Adelante, a similar evidence-based
  intervention developed for a Latino population in the United States-Mexico border
  region. The objective of this study was to examine outcomes for Meta Salud and compare
  them with outcomes for Pasos Adelante., METHODS: This pretest-posttest study took
  place during 13 weeks among low-income residents of an urban area. The program provided
  information on topics such as heart health, physical activity, nutrition, diabetes,
  healthy weight, community health, and emotional well-being; included individual
  and group activities aimed at motivating behavior change; and encouraged participants
  to engage in brisk physical activity., RESULTS: We found significant decreases from
  baseline to conclusion in body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference,
  weight, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. From baseline
  to 3-month follow-up, we found significant decreases in body mass index, waist circumference,
  weight, LDL cholesterol, and glucose, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol. Outcomes for Meta Salud were similar to those found for Pasos Adelante.,
  CONCLUSION: The physiological improvements found among participants in Meta Salud
  and comparable changes among participants in Pasos Adelante suggest a scalable and
  effective behavioral intervention for regions of the United States and Mexico that
  share a common boundary or have similar cultural and linguistic characteristics.'
