abstract: Lifestyle and dietary habits are crucial features that can alter the gut
  microbiome of humans. Humans, along with their gut microbes, have coevolved in order
  to sustain themselves in different environments. They were able to adapt themselves
  to the dietary sources available in their environment. The relation between humans
  and their gut microbiota and the link with coevolution forms an interesting aspect
  of research. To understand this association, the participation of ancient communities
  with less exposure to urbanization is a prerequisite. The current study quantifies
  the richness of bacterial groups in the gut of Nicobarese. This group of population
  is an ethnic community of Nicobar group of islands, who have migrated from the remote
  to rural and urban areas. Alterations in the dominant bacterial groups in relation
  to their lifestyle transition were emphasized, by comparing the participants from
  remote, rural and urban settings. The remote cohort remains diverse and stable than
  the other two cohorts and had higher numbers of Bacteroidetes. Prevotella forms
  the dominant genus in the Bacteroidetes phylum, indicating the carbohydrate-rich
  diet of remote Nicobarese. Whereas, the urban cohort is dominated by Bifidobacterium
  group rather than the Bacteroidetes. Implications of dietary patterns, the transition
  to different lifestyles and their impact on the microbiota among these cohorts are
  discussed.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
