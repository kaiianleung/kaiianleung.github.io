abstract: 'Context: Aldosterone and PTH are implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
  and skeletal diseases. An expanding body of evidence supports a bidirectional and
  positive physiologic relationship between aldosterone and PTH. Large population-based
  studies confirming this relationship, and whether it may be targeted as a potential
  method to mitigate the clinical consequences associated with excess aldosterone
  and PTH, are needed. Objective(s): We hypothesized that higher aldosterone levels
  would associate with higher PTH, and that the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  system (RAAS) inhibitors would predict lower PTH in a large, multi-ethnic, community-based
  cohort. Design, Setting, Participants: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of
  participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis without apparent primary
  hyperparathyroidism or chronic kidney disease (n = 5668). We evaluated associations
  of RAAS inhibitor use with PTH concentration among 1888 treated hypertensive participants.
  We also tested associations of serum aldosterone concentration with PTH concentration
  among 1547 participants with these measurements. Outcome(s): Serum PTH concentration.
  Result(s): Higher aldosterone associated with higher PTH (beta = 0.19 pg/ml per
  1 ng/dl of aldosterone, P textless .0001), and this finding was most pronounced
  among those with a primary hyperaldosteronism-like phenotype. There was a stepwise
  increment in PTH when comparing untreated normotensives, hypertensives using RAAS
  inhibitors, untreated hypertensives, and treated hypertensives using non-RAAS inhibitors
  (40.8,45.0,46.2,47.1 pg/ml, respectively). The use of any RAAS inhibitor independently
  associated with lower PTH (beta = -2.327 pg/ml per use of RAAS inhibitor, P = .006),
  when compared with the use of any non-RAAS inhibitor medication. Conclusion(s):
  Higher serum aldosterone concentration is associated with higher serum PTH concentration,
  and the use of RAAS inhibitors is associated with lower PTH concentration. These
  results extend prior evidence from observational and intervention studies suggesting
  a potentially important and modifiable relationship between the RAAS and PTH in
  humans.Copyright Â© 2015 by the Endocrine Society.'
