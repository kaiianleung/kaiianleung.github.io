abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the effects of a community-based, culturally
  tailored diabetes lifestyle intervention on risk factors for diabetes complications
  among African Americans and Latinos with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred fifty-one
  African American and Latino adults with diabetes were recruited from 3 health care
  systems in Detroit, Michigan, to participate in the Racial and Ethnic Approaches
  to Community Health (REACH) Detroit Partnership diabetes lifestyle intervention.
  The curriculum, delivered by trained community residents, was aimed at improving
  dietary, physical activity, and diabetes self-care behaviors. Baseline and postintervention
  levels of diabetes-specific quality-of-life, diet, physical activity, self-care
  knowledge and behaviors, and hemoglobin A1C were assessed. RESULTS: There were statistically
  significant improvements in postintervention dietary knowledge and behaviors and
  physical activity knowledge. A statistically significant improvement in A1C level
  was achieved among REACH Detroit program participants (Ptextless.0001) compared
  with a group of patients with diabetes in the same health care system in which no
  significant changes were observed (P=.160). CONCLUSIONS: A culturally tailored diabetes
  lifestyle intervention delivered by trained community residents produced significant
  improvement in dietary and diabetes self-care related knowledge and behaviors as
  well as important metabolic improvements.'
