abstract: The role of alcohol in the transmission of HIV and access to health services
  for persons living with HIV/AIDS is relatively unexamined across the globe. Our
  team's community-based, mixed methods study examined both of these questions from
  the perspectives of Aboriginal persons living in Canada with HIV/AIDS (APHA) and
  service providers (SP). A bilingual national survey was undertaken with APHAs and
  SPs and the findings were followed up on in peer interviews. A complex relationship
  was identified between alcohol use, perceptions of alcohol use and access to services.
  Nearly half of APHAs surveyed reported that alcohol played a role in their becoming
  HIV positive. APHAs and SPs differed in their assessment of the impact of alcohol
  in the lives of Aboriginal persons once diagnosed, with a far greater proportion
  of SPs identifying it as problematic. Both SPs and APHAs associated the misuse of
  alcohol with diminished health. Nearly half of the APHAs surveyed shared they had
  been told they were drinking by a SP when they were not, while over one-third reported
  ever being denied services because of drinking when in fact they were not. Both
  SPs and APHAs identified physical health and discrimination as key reasons. Notwithstanding
  these results that point to shortcomings in service provision, the data also reveal
  that most APHAs are recieving care in which their choices are respected and from
  providers they trust. The findings point to the need for a nuanced strategy to solidify
  the strengths and address the shortcomings in APHA's service provision.
