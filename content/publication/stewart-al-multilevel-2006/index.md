abstract: 'Diffusing research-based physical activity programs in underserved communities
  could improve the health of ethnically diverse populations. We utilized a multilevel,
  community-based approach to determine attitudes, resources, needs, and barriers
  to physical activity and the potential diffusion of a physical activity promotion
  program to reach minority and lower-income older adults. Formative research using
  focus groups and individual interviews elicited feedback from multiple community
  sectors: community members, task force and coalition members, administrators, service
  implementers, health care providers, and physical activity instructors. Using qualitative
  data analysis, 47 transcripts (N = 197) were analyzed. Most sectors identified needs
  for culturally diverse resources, promotion of existing resources, demonstration
  of future cost savings, and culturally tailored, proactive outreach. The program
  was viewed favorably, especially if integrated into existing resources. Linking
  sectors to connect resources and expertise was considered essential. Complexities
  of such large-scale collaborations were identified. These results may guide communities
  interested in diffusing health promotion interventions.'
