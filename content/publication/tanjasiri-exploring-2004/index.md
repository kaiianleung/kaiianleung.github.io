abstract: 'During the last 25 years, numerous studies have been conducted to promote
  breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. Most of these studies focused on individual-level
  factors predicting screening, but we are unaware of any that directly examined community
  and ecological influences. The goal of this project, Promoting Access to Health
  for Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian Women (PATH for Women), was to increase
  community capacity for breast and cervical cancer screening and follow up in Los
  Angeles and Orange counties. We focused on Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander
  women because, although they have the lowest rates for cancer, compared to all other
  ethnic groups, relatively few programs have specifically targeted Asian-American
  and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women to promote and sustain screening practices. The
  PATH for Women project involved a partnership between 5 community-based organizations
  and 2 universities, and included 7 Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities:
  Cambodians, Chamorros, Laotians, Thais, Tongans, Samoans, and Vietnamese. In this
  paper, we share our experiences in developing a Geographic Information System (GIS)-mapping
  evaluation component that was used to explore availability and accessibility to
  culturally responsive breast and cervical cancer screening services for Southeast
  Asian and Pacific Islander women in all 7 communities. We describe the methods used
  to develop the maps, and present the preliminary findings that demonstrate significant
  geographic and language barriers to accessing healthcare providers, services for
  breast and cervical cancer screening, and follow up, in each of the communities.
  Finally, we discuss implications for programs designed to promote breast and cervical
  screening and policy education.'
