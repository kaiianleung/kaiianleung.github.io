 abstract = {Although many diabetes self-management apps exist, these are not tailored for people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. This study aimed to explore GP perceptions of how diabetes app features could help GPs better support their patients from CALD backgrounds. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews with GPs in Western Sydney explored attitudes towards a proposed app's suitability for CALD patients. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using Framework Analysis. Theme 1 explored the implications of perceptions that patients' health literacy is dependent on the language used. Theme 2 explored the influence of messaging from sources that share the patient's language and culture (including misinformation from community sources). Theme 3 described the suitability of the app platform for CALD patients, and its potential challenges in this group. GPs perceived that a diabetes app could be useful for providing support to patients from CALD backgrounds. Findings suggest app features should be optimised to address existing challenges that GPs face and carefully consider strategies for recruiting CALD patients. It is important that GPs feel comfortable promoting an app to their CALD patients to help increase participation rates by people in the CALD community.Copyright Â© 2020 La Trobe University.},
