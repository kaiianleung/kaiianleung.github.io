abstract: 'This article investigates verbal short-term memory (vSTM) and verbal working
  memory (vWM) abilities and their relation to lexical and syntactic abilities in
  monolingual (mono-) and bilingual (bi-) children with Developmental Language Disorder
  (DLD) and typical development (TD). The authors employed the following tasks: vSTM
  (non-word repetition and forward digit span), vWM (backward digit span), receptive
  vocabulary, syntactic production (sentence repetition) and syntactic comprehension
  (relative clauses, reflexives and passives). While the mono- and bi-DLD groups underperformed
  the mono- and bi-TD groups respectively in all tasks, the two clinical groups differed
  only in receptive vocabulary. vSTM was a significant predictor of syntactic performance
  for both monolinguals and bilinguals, while vWM was a significant predictor of syntactic
  performance only for bilinguals. These findings suggest that impairments in vSTM,
  wVM and syntax are core clinical features in DLD, and that vWM makes a greater contribution
  to syntax in bilinguals than in monolinguals. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021
