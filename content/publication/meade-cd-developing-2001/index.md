abstract: 'PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine effective strategies for building community-academic
  partnerships for the promotion of breast cancer education and outreach among rural
  and Hispanic migrant and seasonal farmworker women, mostly from Mexican descent.
  DATA SOURCES: Published research and education articles and books, community-education
  models, personal experiences, and community key informant feedback. DATA SYNTHESIS:
  Effective community partnerships for enhanced education and outreach include a framework
  based on a network of partners with common goals, communication processes based
  on trust, and bilingual/bicultural and culturally competent staff. CONCLUSION(S):
  A sustainable community partnership can be achieved through systematic but flexible
  approaches to community planning. Involvement of community members in the development
  and implementation of education and screening activities helps ensure that community
  needs are met. Relationships based on mutual respect are key. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
  PRACTICE: Nurses can act as catalysts through community capacity building to create
  community-academic partnerships to reach medically underserved populations with
  cancer screening, outreach, and education through the delivery of strategies that
  are based on common goals.'
