abstract: An academic institution and a community organization partnered for one of
  the first studies assessing health needs of Mixtecs, indigenous immigrants from
  Southern Mexico, residing in Ventura County, California. Ten bilingual Spanish-
  and Mixteco-speaking promotores received a 1-day focus group training, participated
  in a focus group themselves and conducted 5 focus groups with 42 Mixtec community
  members. The focus group training is described. Health concerns discussed in the
  focus groups include outdoor exercise among women viewed as flirtatious; reluctance
  to ask for governmental assistance due to fear that children will have to pay back
  later; soda consumption perceived as a symbol of socio-economic status; and unwillingness
  to obtain mammograms or pap smears because private body parts are to be touched
  by husbands only. Training promotores to conduct focus groups can increase organizational
  capacity to identify pressing health needs in under-represented and hard-to-reach
  population groups.
