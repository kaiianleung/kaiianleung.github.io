abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To explore cultural-contextual factors that impact the high
  rate of Hispanic/Latina teen pregnancy in Oklahoma from the perspective of providers
  and parents. METHOD(S): Community Based Participatory Research at the Latino Community
  Development Agency in Oklahoma City; focus groups and in-depth interviews; 33 service
  providers and 14 Hispanic/Latino parents. RESULT(S): (a) The value of respect among
  Hispanic/Latino families is a risk factor for unplanned teen pregnancy. (b) Contextual
  aspects (i.e. local ideology, Mexican media, underfunded schools, permissive law
  enforcement in bars, lack of bilingual providers) place Hispanic/Latina female adolescents
  at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy. (c) Gender roles perpetuate inequality and
  deepen Hispanic/Latina females' vulnerability to unplanned pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S):
  In addition to currently implemented communication tools and parenting skills to
  talk with adolescents about sexual health topics, interventions need to consider
  preferences that may be rooted in cultural aspects that could hinder the application
  of learned skills."
