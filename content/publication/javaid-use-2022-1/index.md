abstract: "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the practice and
  perceptions of shared decision-making (SDM) by both faculty and residents at Boston
  Medical Center and explore barriers and facilitators to implementing SDM at our
  institution., METHODS: We created and distributed an online survey assessing provider
  demographic and training characteristics, experiences with the informed consent
  process, practices in SDM, and perceptions about SDM. We used descriptive statistics
  to summarize provider characteristics and survey responses and univariate analysis
  to determine associations between them., RESULTS: Fifteen surgeons and 19 surgical
  residents completed the survey (49% response rate). Most respondents were aware
  of and had a positive attitude toward SDM (91% and 76%, respectively); 35% reported
  having SDM training. Providers had varying levels of engagement with different SDM
  practices, and there were inconsistent associations between provider characteristics
  and the use of SDM. Often providers thought the patient's health literacy, foreign
  primary language, clinical condition, and socioeconomic factors were barriers to
  the SDM process., CONCLUSIONS: Although most general surgery faculty and residents
  at our institution had a positive view of SDM, they engaged in SDM behaviors inconsistently,
  with no clear association between clinician characteristics and specific behaviors.
  We identified several barriers to SDM consistent with those identified by providers
  in other specialties. This highlights the need for further research to study live
  general surgery provider-patient interactions, as well as structured SDM education
  to train general surgery providers to reliably engage their patients in effective
  SDM. Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
