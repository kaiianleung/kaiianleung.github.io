abstract: Hispanic/Latino representation in medical research remains poor. We describe
  factors affecting rates of recruitment, participation, adherence, and retention
  of Hispanics/Latinos in clinical studies in the United States and characterize proposed
  strategies to improve these rates. A targeted literature review was conducted. Relevant
  studies were identified from Embase, MEDLINEÂ®, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2010
  to September 4, 2020. Sixty-eight studies were included. Key facilitators to research
  involvement were establishing trust between research staff and participants, incorporating
  familism, and using culturally appropriate language. Common elements of successful
  strategies for improving research involvement included incorporating community partners,
  bilingual and culturally competent research staff, continuous engagement and building
  relationships between participants and staff, and incorporating Hispanic/Latino
  cultural values. There is no universal strategy to improve research involvement
  of Hispanics/Latinos. The best strategy is likely a combination of key elements
  from several strategies, tailored to each unique study population. Further research
  is needed.
