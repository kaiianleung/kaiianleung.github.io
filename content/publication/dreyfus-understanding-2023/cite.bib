 abstract = {Hispanic/Latino representation in medical research remains poor. We describe factors affecting rates of recruitment, participation, adherence, and retention of Hispanics/Latinos in clinical studies in the United States and characterize proposed strategies to improve these rates. A targeted literature review was conducted. Relevant studies were identified from Embase, MEDLINEÂ®, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2010 to September 4, 2020. Sixty-eight studies were included. Key facilitators to research involvement were establishing trust between research staff and participants, incorporating familism, and using culturally appropriate language. Common elements of successful strategies for improving research involvement included incorporating community partners, bilingual and culturally competent research staff, continuous engagement and building relationships between participants and staff, and incorporating Hispanic/Latino cultural values. There is no universal strategy to improve research involvement of Hispanics/Latinos. The best strategy is likely a combination of key elements from several strategies, tailored to each unique study population. Further research is needed.},
