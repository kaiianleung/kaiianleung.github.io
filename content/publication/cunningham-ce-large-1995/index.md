abstract: 'A significant percentage of children with disruptive behaviour disorders
  do not receive mental health assistance. Utilization is lowest among groups whose
  children are at greatest risk. To increase the availability, accessibility, and
  cost efficacy of parent training programs, this prospective randomized trial compared
  a large group community-based parent training program to a clinic-based individual
  parent training (PT) program. All families of junior kindergartners in the Hamilton
  public and separate school boards were sent a checklist regarding problems at home.
  Those returning questionnaires above the 90th percentile were block randomly assigned
  to: (1) a 12-week clinic-based individual parent training (Clinic/Individual), (2)
  a 12-week community-based large group parent training (Community/Group), or (3)
  a waiting list control condition. Immigrant families, those using English as a second
  language, and parents of children with severe behaviour problems were significantly
  more liklely to enrol in Community/Groups than Clinic/Individual PT. Parents in
  Community/Groups reported greater improvements in behaviour problems at home and
  better maintenance of these gains at 6-month follow up. A cost analysis showed that
  with groups of 18 families, Community/Groups are more than six times as cost effective
  as Clinic/Individual programs.'
