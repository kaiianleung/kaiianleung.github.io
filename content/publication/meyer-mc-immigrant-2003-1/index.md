abstract: Few studies on women's health include immigrant women as participants, and
  fewer are conducted by immigrant women themselves. In this article, the authors
  present a model that allowed their full participation as researchers and authors.
  They describe their experiences using participatory research methods with Hispanic
  women in multiple ways to reach out to isolated women, collect data about community
  needs, and provide health education. They explore the advantages and challenges
  of being trained for both researcher and health educator roles, describe opportunities
  to use this approach to assess service needs, and discuss the potential for personal
  empowerment. They also report on the time commitment that such a bilingual project
  requires. In the process of interviewing marginalized women, they realized how much
  health promotion and participatory research complement each other. The authors conclude
  that combining participatory research with health promotion activities has promise
  to contribute toward increased empowerment of immigrant communities.
