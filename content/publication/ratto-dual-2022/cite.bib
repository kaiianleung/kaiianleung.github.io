 abstract = {Previous findings show executive functioning advantages associated with dual language learning (DLL) among neurotypical individuals, yet few studies have investigated these effects in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study investigated effects of DLL and socioeconomic status (SES) on parent-reported executive functioning, verbal ability, and social-emotional functioning using a sample of DLL (n = 53) and monolingual (n = 106) youth with ASD without intellectual disability, matched on gender and full-scale IQ scores. After controlling for the effects of SES, results showed that monolingual youth had better outcomes on verbal ability, while DLL youth had fewer parent-reported problems with executive functioning and unusual behaviors. These findings indicate that bilingualism may mitigate executive functioning deficits in youth with ASD. Copyright Â© 2021.
