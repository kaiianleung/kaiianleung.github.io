abstract: Word learning is a significant milestone in language acquisition. The second
  year of life marks a period of dramatic advances in infants' expressive and receptive
  word-processing abilities. Studies show that in adulthood, language processing is
  left-hemisphere dominant. However, adults learning a second language activate right-hemisphere
  brain functions. In infancy, acquisition of a first language involves recruitment
  of bilateral brain networks, and strong left-hemisphere dominance emerges by the
  third year. In the current study we focus on 14-month-old infants in the earliest
  stages of word learning using infant magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imagining
  to characterize neural activity in response to familiar and unfamiliar words. Specifically,
  we examine the relationship between right-hemisphere brain responses and prospective
  measures of vocabulary growth. As expected, MEG source modeling revealed a broadly
  distributed network in frontal, temporal and parietal cortex that distinguished
  word classes between 150-900 ms after word onset. Importantly, brain activity in
  the right frontal cortex in response to familiar words was highly correlated with
  vocabulary growth at 18, 21, 24, and 27 months. Specifically, higher activation
  to familiar words in the 150-300 ms interval was associated with faster vocabulary
  growth, reflecting processing efficiency, whereas higher activation to familiar
  words in the 600-900 ms interval was associated with slower vocabulary growth, reflecting
  cognitive effort. These findings inform research and theory on the involvement of
  right frontal cortex in specific cognitive processes and individual differences
  related to attention that may play an important role in the development of left-lateralized
  word processing. Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights
