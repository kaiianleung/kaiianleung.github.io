abstract: Over the course of literacy development, children learn to recognize word
  sounds and meanings in print. Yet, they do so differently across alphabetic and
  character-based orthographies such as English and Chinese. To uncover cross-linguistic
  influences on children's literacy, we asked young Chinese-English simultaneous bilinguals
  and English monolinguals (N = 119, ages 5-10) to complete phonological and morphological
  awareness (MA) literacy tasks. Children completed the tasks in the auditory modality
  in each of their languages during functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging.
  Cross-linguistically, comparisons between bilinguals' two languages revealed that
  the task that was more central to reading in a given orthography, such as phonological
  awareness (PA) in English and MA in Chinese, elicited less activation in the left
  inferior frontal and parietal regions. Group comparisons between bilinguals and
  monolinguals in English, their shared language of academic instruction, revealed
  that the left inferior frontal was less active during phonology but more active
  during morphology in bilinguals relative to monolinguals. MA skills are generally
  considered to have greater language specificity than PA skills. Bilingual literacy
  training in a skill that is maximally similar across languages, such as PA, may
  therefore yield greater automaticity for this skill, as reflected in the lower activation
  in bilinguals relative to monolinguals. This interpretation is supported by negative
  correlations between proficiency and brain activation. Together, these findings
  suggest that both the structural characteristics and literacy experiences with a
  given language can exert specific influences on bilingual and monolingual children's
  emerging brain networks for learning to read. Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors. Human
