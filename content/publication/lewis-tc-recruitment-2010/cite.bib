 abstract = {Rationale: Traffic emissions have been linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. We are initiating a longitudinal epidemiology study of children with asthma living within defined exposure zones around highways in Detroit, Michigan in order to characterize exposure to vehicular exhaust and associated short-term health effects. Objective(s): To design and implement a population-based strategy for recruitment of children with asthma, ages 6-13, living in three exposure zones around highways. Enrollment will include three exposure groups: a) A high traffic/high diesel group living within 150 m of highways with a high volume of truck traffic; b) A high traffic/low diesel group living within 150 m of highways with a low volume of truck traffic; and c) A low traffic/low diesel group living more than 450 m from highways and at least 300 m from major surface roads and whom are from the same neighborhoods as the high traffic groups. Method(s): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, a partnership of multidisciplinary university faculty, representatives of community-based organizations and the local health department, and local health activists collaboratively developed recruitment tools and designed and implemented the recruitment plan. Result(s): Key elements of the recruitment design include: a) Development and pilot testing of a machine-readable screening questionnaire in three languages to identify children with asthma; b) Selection of a community appropriate incentive plan; c) Employment of bilingual/bicultural local residents as recruitment staff; d) Distribution of screening questionnaires via a two-pronged strategy: first, broad geographical distribution through schools and community-wide events, and second, intensive local campaigns that involved door-to-door canvassing of all residential addresses within the 150 m buffer of designated highway segments; e) Identification of a pool of potentially eligible children by geocoding and mapping addresses from questionnaires meeting screening criteria; f) Selection of a subset of children to be contacted based on geographic clustering; g) Notification to families by mail of potential eligibility followed by a phone call or home visit to provide detailed information about the study and to schedule of an enrollment visit. Efficiencies were achieved by recruiting for two studies simultaneously. As of November 2009, we have processed 3779 screening questionnaires, identified 792 potentially eligible children, selected 150 for contacting, attempted 38 contacts, and successfully consented 22 families. Recruitment is ongoing. Conclusion(s): "High touch" local neighborhood canvassing techniques and "high-tech" geographic information systems methods can be successfully combined to meet challenges recruiting for environmental epidemiology studies.},
