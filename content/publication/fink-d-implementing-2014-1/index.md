abstract: 'Falls in older adults are a significant public health issue and a particularly
  significant health risk in Minnesota. With accumulating research evidence suggesting
  that falls can be prevented through exercise, there is an increased public health
  effort among organizations serving older adults to translate and disseminate evidence-based
  programs into the community. Such efforts, however, face additional challenges if
  they are implemented in communities with older adults from different cultural backgrounds
  and languages. This paper briefly describes a pilot community-based dissemination
  project, including the initiation, implementation, process, and outcomes, of an
  evidence-based fall prevention (Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance formerly
  known as Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance) through a local Area Agency on Aging
  in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota (USA). Overall, the program
  was successfully implemented resulting in adoption by local community organizations
  serving Asian and, to a lesser degree, East African non-English speaking older adults.
  Bilingual community instructors were trained to lead the classes resulting in broad
  participation and improved physical performance by the older adults targeted for
  the intervention. The results from this pilot study indicate that Tai Ji Quan: Moving
  for Better Balance can be implemented with positive results in non-English speaking
  community settings using bilingual leaders. Â© 2014 Shanghai University of Sport.'
