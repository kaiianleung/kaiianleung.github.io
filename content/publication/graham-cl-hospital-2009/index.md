abstract: 'Purpose: This qualitative study assessed the needs of patients and caregivers
  during the transition from hospital to home. We specifically identified unmet needs
  of ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and seniors with limited English proficiency
  (LEP). Findings are translated into recommendations for improving services to these
  groups during health care transitions. Design and Methods: This needs assessment
  included extensive analysis of qualitative data collected from 20 language-, culture-,
  and ethnic-specific focus groups with caregivers who recently assisted a senior
  after a hospital discharge. Findings from these focus groups were supplemented by
  5 in-depth, longitudinal case studies of recently hospitalized seniors and their
  caregivers. Result(s): Inadequate information and training at discharge were themes
  that spanned all groups, despite ethnicity or language. Additional unmet needs were
  identified for ethnic minorities, those with LEP, and recent immigrants, including
  lower levels of social support than might be expected, lack of linguistically appropriate
  information and services, and cultural and financial barriers to using long-term
  care services. Implications: As ethnic diversity increases among older Americans,
  it will become increasingly important to design health care services to meet the
  needs of diverse groups. Recommendations include assessments of informal care, bilingual
  information and services, partnerships with community agencies providing culturally
  competent services, and expansion of home- and community-based services to near-poor
  seniors.'
