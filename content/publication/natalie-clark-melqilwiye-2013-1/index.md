abstract: 'The goal of this exploratory community-based participatory action research
  project was twofold: to determine how urban Aboriginal youth identify their health
  needs within a culturally centred model of health and wellness, and to create new
  knowledge and research capacity by and with urban Aboriginal youth and urban Aboriginal
  health-care providers. A mixed-method approach was employed to examine these experiences
  using talking circles and a survey. The study contributes to anticolonial research
  in that it resists narratives of dis(ease) put forth through neocolonial research
  paradigms. A key focus was the development of strategies that address the aspirations
  of urban Aboriginal youth, laying foundations upon which their potential in health
  and wellness can be nurtured, supported, and realized. The study contributes to
  a new narrative of the health of urban Aboriginal youth within a culturally centred
  and culturally safe framework that acknowledges their strong connection to their
  Indigenous lands, languages, and traditions while also recognizing the spaces between
  which they move.'
