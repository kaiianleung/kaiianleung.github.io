abstract: Prevention remains key in the fight against HIV/AIDS. However, prevention
  requires understanding the sociocultural and economic context in which HIV-risk
  behaviors occur. This qualitative, descriptive study was part of the initial phase
  of a larger project to adapt and test a community-based HIV-prevention intervention.
  We conducted individual interviews with rural Malawian community leaders and focus
  groups with adult community residents to elicit perceptions of both sexual and non-sexual
  HIV-risk behaviors and their sociocultural context. Interviews and focus groups
  were conducted in Chichewa, audio-taped, transcribed and translated into English
  by bilingual co-investigators. Content analysis of transcripts was done collaboratively
  by US-based and Malawian co-investigators to confirm culturally accurate interpretation
  of data. Participants identified sexual and non-sexual HIV-risk behaviors and contextual
  factors that influence these behaviors, including gender relations, cultural practices,
  economic conditions and religion. Community leaders and residents voiced similar
  perspectives on risk behaviors, except that community leaders were much less likely
  than residents to discuss sexual transmission through participation in traditional
  cultural practices. We incorporated these study results in adapting our HIV-prevention
  intervention to the sociocultural context of rural Malawi. Study participation enhanced
  the community leader's and resident's interest in the intervention phase of the
  project. Â© 2008 Taylor & Francis.
