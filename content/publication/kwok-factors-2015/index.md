abstract: 'BackgroundHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become increasingly
  common for treatment of severe hematological disorders. However, the number of compatible
  hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors is usually limited. Expanding donor pool size
  would enhance matching success by increasing donor frequency and introducing allelic
  diversity within the registry. Identifying factors that affect public willingness
  towards HSC donation allows better strategic recruitment planning to facilitate
  donor pool expansion. Previous studies in white populations showed knowledge, family
  attitude, trust towards the healthcare system, fear, self-identity, and social identity
  are important factors related to HSC donation intention. However, given the differences
  in cultural and society values that exist across different regions, in particular
  between the East and West, whether these factors influence HSC donation willingness
  in Hong Kong remained to be determined. The objective of this study was to identify
  factors associated with HSC donation motivation in Hong Kong.Material and methodsA
  large-scale, cross-sectional, observational study involving 3479 local participants.ResultsThere
  is a positive correlation of HSC donation intention with younger age (18-32, OR:
  1.80, p≤0·001) and higher education (OR: 1·47, p≤0.001). Better HSCT knowledge is
  also related to greater HSC donation intention (OR: 2.55, p£0.001).ConclusionsOur
  data suggests HSCT education could help to improve donor recruitment and that more
  resources should be allocated for public education.'
