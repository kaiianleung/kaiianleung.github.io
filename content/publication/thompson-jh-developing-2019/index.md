abstract: "Introduction: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death
  in the United States, and screening rates are disproportionately low among Latinos.
  One factor thought to contribute to the low screening rate is the difficulty Latinos
  encounter in understanding health information, and therefore in taking appropriate
  health action. Therefore, we used Boot Camp Translation (BCT), a patient engagement
  approach, to engage Latino stakeholders (ie, patients, clinic staff) in refining
  the messages and format of colon cancer screening reminders for a clinic-based direct
  mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) program. Method(s): Patient participants
  were Latino, ages 50 to 75 years, able to speak English or Spanish, and willing
  to participate in the in-person kickoff meeting and follow-up phone calls over a
  3-month period. We held separate BCT sessions for English- and Spanish-speaking
  participants. As part of the in-person meetings, a bilingual colon cancer expert
  presented on colon health and screening messages and BCT facilitators led interactive
  sessions where participants reviewed materials and reminder messages in various
  modalities (eg, letter, text). Participants considered what information about colon
  cancer screening was important, the best methods to share these messages, and the
  timing and frequency with which these messages should be delivered to patients to
  encourage FIT completion. We used follow-up phone calls to iteratively refine materials
  developed based on key learnings from the in-person meeting. Result(s): Twenty-five
  adults participated in the in-person sessions (English [n 12]; Spanish [n 13]).
  Patient participants were primarily enrolled in Medicaid/uninsured (76%) and had
  annual household incomes less than $20,000 (67%). Key themes distilled from the
  sessions included increasing awareness that screening can prevent colon cancer,
  stressing the urgency of screening, emphasizing the motivating influence of family,
  and using personalized messages from the practice such as 'I' or 'we' statements
  in letters or automated phone call reminders delivered by humans. Participants in
  both sessions noted the importance of receiving an automated or live alert before
  a FIT kit is mailed and a reminder within 2 weeks of FIT kit mailing. Discussion(s):
  Using BCT, we successfully incorporated participant feedback to adapt culturally
  relevant health messages to promote FIT testing among Latino patients served by
  community clinics. Materials will be tested in the larger Participatory Research
  to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention (PROMPT) trial.Copyright Â© 2019 American Board
