abstract: 'INTRODUCTION Under-representation in health-related research is one of
  a multitude of factors that contribute to cancer disparities experienced by African
  American and Latinx communities. Barriers to research participation stem from historical
  social injustices, are multi-faceted and include factors specific to the research
  process, research team members and community experiences and expectations about
  research participation. Informed consent is a longitudinal process and represents
  an opportunity to address these barriers and potentially improve access to research
  by individuals from underrepresented groups. The purpose of the Strengthening Translational
  Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) study was to develop and test an integrated,
  literacy- and culturally-sensitive, multi-component intervention that addresses
  barriers to research participation during the informed consent process. METHODS
  A multi-pronged community engaged approach was used to inform the development the
  three components of the STRIDE intervention. At each of the three study sites, Community
  Investigators, local community members of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, contribute
  to intervention development, pilot testing and dissemination activities. Community
  engagement studios provided a semi-structured opportunity to solicit feedback from
  community experts in a facilitated group regarding the relevance, usability and
  understandability of the STRIDE intervention components. Additionally, component-specific
  approaches to obtaining community input were utilized. RESULTS The three components
  were developed and refined with community input. The STRIDE intervention includes:
  (1) an electronic consent (eConsent) framework within the REDCap software platform
  that incorporates tools designed to facilitate material comprehension and relevance,
  (2) a storytelling intervention in which prior research participants from diverse
  backgrounds share their experiences, and (3) a simulation-based training program
  for research assistants that emphasizes cultural competency and communication skills
  for assisting in the informed consent process. CONCLUSIONS The STRIDE project had
  produced an integrated set of interventions that are available to support researchers
  across the CTSA hubs and beyond in efforts to enhance diversity in clinical research.
  Early dissemination of STRIDE intervention components include utilization in national
  COVID-19 trials and research networks.'
