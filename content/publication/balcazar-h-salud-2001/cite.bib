 abstract = {In this article we describe several process evaluation activities of Salud para su Corazon (Health for your Heart), a community-based Latino cardiovascular disease prevention and outreach program created by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute which includes culturally relevant and language-appropriate materials for Latinos. Program activities evaluated included a series of 15 charlas, or group discussions, led by various health professionals, a telephone follow-up interview conducted after the charlas and a 21-segment radio program with distribution of educational materials. Data were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed by 200 people and from two telephone surveys of Latino men and women living in the Washington, DC area. Analyses included gender and age group comparisons of overall satisfaction with the charlas, diffusion of information from charlas and printed materials, participants' adoption of heart-healthy behaviors, and consumer satisfaction with the radio program and printed educational materials. Few gender and age differences were found and results showed that participants were satisfied with the charlas and the radio program. Between 54% and 87% of charla respondents reported sharing printed educational materials with others. The average number of bilingual booklets read by different gender and age groups was between four and five. The results demonstrate how programmatic activities of Salud para su Corazon were effectively disseminated in the Latino community of Washington, DC.},
