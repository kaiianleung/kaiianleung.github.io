abstract: "Background/Objectives: Assessment of cognition in linguistically diverse
  aging populations is a growing need. Bilingualism may complicate cognitive measurement
  precision, and bilingualism may vary across Hispanic/Latinx sub-populations. We
  examined the association among bilingualism, assessment language, and cognitive
  screening performance in a primarily non-immigrant Mexican American community. Design(s):
  Prospective, community-based cohort study: The Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus
  Christi (BASIC)-Cognitive study. Setting(s): Nueces County, Texas. Participant(s):
  Community-dwelling Mexican Americans age 65+, recruited door-to-door using a two-stage
  area probability sampling procedure. Measurements: Montreal Cognitive Assessment
  (MoCA); self-reported bilingualism scale. Participants were classified as monolingual,
  Spanish dominant bilingual, English dominant bilingual, or balanced bilingual based
  upon bilingualism scale responses. Linear regressions examined relationships among
  bilingualism, demographics, cognitive assessment language, and MoCA scores. Result(s):
  The analytic sample included 547 Mexican American participants (60% female). Fifty-eight
  percent were classified as balanced bilingual, the majority (88.6%) of whom selected
  assessment in English. Balanced bilinguals that completed the MoCA in English performed
  better than balanced bilinguals that completed the MoCA in Spanish (b = -4.0, p
  textless 0.05). Among balanced bilinguals that took the MoCA in Spanish, education
  outside of the United States was associated with better performance (b = 4.4, p
  textless 0.001). Adjusting for demographics and education, we found no association
  between the degree of bilingualism and MoCA performance (p's textgreater 0.10).
  Conclusion(s): Bilingualism is important to consider in cognitive aging studies
  in linguistically diverse communities. Future research should examine whether cognitive
  test language selection affects cognitive measurement precision in balanced bilinguals.Copyright
