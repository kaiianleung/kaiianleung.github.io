abstract: In Canada, high rates of anxiety, depression and suicides have resulted
  in mental health crises in First Nation (FN) communities. To date, Indigenous worldviews
  and approaches have not been fully heeded in mainstream strategies to address the
  complexity of living in colonial oppression, despite ongoing crises for decades.
  We describe perspectives of eight FN communities explaining cultural facilitators
  of mental wellbeing. The objective is to promote understanding of wellbeing in the
  context of sociocultural realities of FN communities and elaborate community-based
  practices. Qualitative methods involved FN partners in study design, implementation
  and data interpretation processes. Local research assistants collected data in all
  participating communities. Respondents were purposefully selected, Elders were recommended
  based on their knowledge of FN cultures and traditional wellness practices and awareness
  of health and social issues in respective communities. Results challenge specific
  histories of dispossession and assaults on community, language, identity, Elders,
  family; traditional healing practices emerged as important in enhancing mental wellbeing
  among FN. Culturally informed approaches aim to restore balance and harmony as pre-requisite
  to health. A framework based on the voices of FN in Manitoba is proposed for achieving
  mental wellbeing by and for FN people as an integral part of primary healthcare.
