abstract: 'Background: The objective of Alabama Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community
  Health 2010 is to implement and evaluate a community action plan (CAP) developed
  by a diverse coalition to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities
  between African American and White women. Methods: The CAP entailed (1) establishing
  a core working group (CWG) in each county, (2) training CWG members to promote screenings,
  and (3) providing coalition members with technical assistance to write mini-grants.
  Results: Overall, 241 CWG members were trained. They have conducted 2800 cancer
  screening surveys. A total of 8 coalition members received mini-grants. Conclusion:
  Community capacity building can lead to a sense of ownership and empowerment.'
