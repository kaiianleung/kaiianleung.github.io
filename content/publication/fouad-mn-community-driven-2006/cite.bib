 abstract = {Background: The objective of Alabama Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health 2010 is to implement and evaluate a community action plan (CAP) developed by a diverse coalition to reduce breast and cervical cancer screening disparities between African American and White women. Methods: The CAP entailed (1) establishing a core working group (CWG) in each county, (2) training CWG members to promote screenings, and (3) providing coalition members with technical assistance to write mini-grants. Results: Overall, 241 CWG members were trained. They have conducted 2800 cancer screening surveys. A total of 8 coalition members received mini-grants. Conclusion: Community capacity building can lead to a sense of ownership and empowerment.},
