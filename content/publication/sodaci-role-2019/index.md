abstract: Subject pronoun expression has been extensively studied for effects of language
  contact, but it is fairly recent that these studies started including cross-language
  structural priming paradigms. The earlier studies on subject pronoun use in Turkish
  spoken by Turkish-Dutch bilinguals did not find any difference from monolingual
  speakers of Turkish but reported a few instances of unconventional use of subject
  pronouns, indicating the influence of Dutch on Turkish. This study aimed to determine
  whether structural priming may have a part in the unconventional variation observed
  in subject pronoun use in Turkish in contact with Dutch. Twenty-eight Turkish-Dutch
  bilinguals listened to short stories and responded to subsequently presented instructive
  sentences. These sentences were prime sentences, which contained either an overt
  or a null subject pronoun. Priming effects were investigated in monolingual and
  bilingual settings by presenting the stories in Turkish in the former and in Dutch
  in the latter. Results yielded a higher likelihood of using overt subject pronouns
  in the bilingual than in the monolingual setting following a prime sentence with
  an overt rather than a null pronoun. Our findings, which are based on a structure
  and a language that have not yet been studied much in relation to structural priming
  (i.e., subject pronoun use in Turkish), strengthen the empirical basis of how structural
  priming influences syntactic choices in language contact settings.
