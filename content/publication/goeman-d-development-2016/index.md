abstract: "Objective To develop an inclusive model of culturally sensitive support,
  using a specialist dementia nurse (SDN), to assist people with dementia from culturally
  and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities and their carers to overcome barriers
  to accessing health and social care services. Design Co-creation and participatory
  action research, based on reflection, data collection, interaction and feedback
  from participants and stakeholders. Setting An SDN support model embedded within
  a home nursing service in Melbourne, Australia was implemented between October 2013
  and October 2015. Participants People experiencing memory loss or with a diagnosis
  of dementia from CALD backgrounds and their carers and family living in the community
  setting and expert stakeholders. Data collection and analysis Reflections from the
  SDN on interactions with participants and expert stakeholder opinion informed the
  CALD dementia support model and pathway. Results Interaction with 62 people living
  with memory loss or dementia from CALD backgrounds, carers or family members receiving
  support from the SDN and feedback from 13 expert stakeholders from community aged-care
  services, consumer advocacy organisations and ethnic community group representatives
  informed the development and refinement of the CALD dementia model of care and pathway.
  We delineate the three components of the 'SDN' model: the organisational support;
  a description of the role; and the competencies needed. Additionally, we provide
  an accompanying pathway for use by health professionals delivering care to consumers
  with dementia from CALD backgrounds. Conclusions Our culturally sensitive model
  of dementia care and accompanying pathway allows for the tailoring of health and
  social support to assist people from CALD backgrounds, their carers and families
  to adjust to living with memory loss and remain living in the community as long
  as possible. The model and accompanying pathway also have the potential to be rolled
  out nationally for use by health professionals across a variety of health services."
