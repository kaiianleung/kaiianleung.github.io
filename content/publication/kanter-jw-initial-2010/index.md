abstract: Latinos demonstrate high rates of depression, often do not seek treatment,
  and terminate prematurely for a variety of reasons, including lack of sensitivity
  to contextual and cultural factors in treatment approaches. For decades researchers
  have suggested a behavioral approach to Latinos diagnosed with depression because
  such an approach targets the complex environmental stressors experienced by these
  populations with a simple, pragmatic approach. Recently, behavioral activation has
  been culturally and linguistically adapted for Latinos/Latinas diagnosed with depression
  (BA-Latino or BAL). The current study consists of a pilot evaluation of BAL at a
  bilingual (Spanish-English) community mental health clinic (N = 10 Latinas). Results
  provide preliminary support for the feasibility and effectiveness of BAL for Latinas
  in a community setting in terms of treatment adherence, retention, and outcomes.
  Implications and future directions are discussed. Â© 2010 SAGE Publications.
