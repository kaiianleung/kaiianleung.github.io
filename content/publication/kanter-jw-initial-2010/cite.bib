 abstract = {Latinos demonstrate high rates of depression, often do not seek treatment, and terminate prematurely for a variety of reasons, including lack of sensitivity to contextual and cultural factors in treatment approaches. For decades researchers have suggested a behavioral approach to Latinos diagnosed with depression because such an approach targets the complex environmental stressors experienced by these populations with a simple, pragmatic approach. Recently, behavioral activation has been culturally and linguistically adapted for Latinos/Latinas diagnosed with depression (BA-Latino or BAL). The current study consists of a pilot evaluation of BAL at a bilingual (Spanish-English) community mental health clinic (N = 10 Latinas). Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility and effectiveness of BAL for Latinas in a community setting in terms of treatment adherence, retention, and outcomes. Implications and future directions are discussed. Â© 2010 SAGE Publications.},
