abstract: "AIM: This study determined whether cognitive outcomes differed between
  very preterm (VPT) and extremely preterm (EPT) children who were monolingual or
  multilingual when they reached the corrected ages of two and five years., METHODS:
  The data were collected at the Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands,
  as part of our national neonatal follow-up programme and comprised 325 VPT/EPT children
  born between January 1, 2007 and January 1, 2012. The study used the Third Editions
  of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Wechsler Preschool
  and Primary Scale of Intelligence., RESULTS: We compared 234 monolingual children,
  65 multilingual children who spoke Dutch and at least one foreign language at home
  and 26 multilingual children who didn't speak Dutch at home. The best performers
  on the cognitive scale at two years of age and the verbal subscales at five years
  of age were the monolingual children, followed by the children who spoke Dutch and
  at least one foreign language at home, then the children who only spoke foreign
  languages at home., CONCLUSION: In our study cohort from The Netherlands, multilingualism
  lowered the cognitive and verbal outcomes of VPT/EPT children at the corrected ages
  of two and five years. Copyright Â©2018 The Authors. Acta Paediatrica published by
