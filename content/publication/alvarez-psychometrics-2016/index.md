abstract: Shared decision making (SDM) and effective patient-provider communication
  are key and interrelated elements of patient-centered care that impact health and
  behavioral health outcomes. Measurement of SDM and communication from the patient's
  perspective is necessary in order to ensure that health care systems and individual
  providers are responsive to patient views. However, there is a void of research
  addressing the psychometric properties of these measures with diverse patients,
  including non-English speakers, and in the context of behavioral health encounters.
  This study evaluated the psychometric properties of 2 patient-centered outcome measures,
  the Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-9 (SDM-Q) and the Kim Alliance Scale-Communication
  subscale (KAS-CM), in a sample of 239 English and Spanish-speaking behavioral health
  patients. One dominant factor was found for each scale and this structure was used
  to examine whether there was measurement invariance across the 2 language groups.
  One SDM-Q item was inconsistent with the configural invariance comparison and was
  removed. The remaining SDM-Q items exhibited strong invariance, meaning that item
  loadings and item means were similar across the 2 groups. The KAS-CM items had limited
  variability, with most respondents indicating high communication levels, and the
  invariance analysis was done on binary versions of the items. These had metric invariance
  (loadings the same over groups) but several items violated the strong invariance
  test. In both groups, the SDM-Q had high internal consistency, whereas the KAS-CM
  was only adequate. These findings help interpret results for individual patients,
  taking into account cultural and linguistic differences in how patients perceive
  SDM and patient-provider communication. (PsycINFO Database Record Copyright (c)
