abstract: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in Australia. Limited research
  is available on access to Cognitive Dementia and Memory Services (CDAMS) for people
  with dementia from Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities. This
  study aimed to determine the barriers and enablers to accessing CDAMS for people
  with dementia and their families of Chinese and Vietnamese backgrounds. Consultations
  with community members, community workers and health professionals were conducted
  using the \"Cultural Exchange Model\" framework. For carers, barriers to accessing
  services included the complexity of the health system, lack of time, travel required
  to get to services, language barriers, interpreters and lack of knowledge of services.
  Similarly, community workers and health professionals identified language, interpreters,
  and community perceptions as key barriers to service access. Strategies to increase
  knowledge included providing information via radio, printed material and education
  in community group settings. The \"Cultural Exchange Model\" enabled engagement
  with and modification of the approaches to meet the needs of the targeted CALD communities.
