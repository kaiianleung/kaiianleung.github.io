abstract: "Objective: In the context of institutional incompleteness affecting the
  official minority language communities, we examine how the Francophones in a minority
  context see the future of health services offered in French.Method: The study is
  based on a participatory methodology: the concept mapping will serve to identify
  the conceptual universe of a given problem. From a master statement such as: \\\"\
  When I think about the future of health services in French, I think of ...\\\",
  participants are invited to make as many statements as come to mind. These statements
  are then categorized individually and treated collectively through a multivariate
  analysis.Outcome: The main themes emerging from the mapping exercise indicate the
  issues and challenges raised by the participants, namely the geographical context,
  specific needs, language rights, education and training, human resources, bilingualism
  and translation, the minority experience, active offer, the role of governmental
  bodies, community mobilization, collaboration and networking.Conclusion: The participatory
  approach that concept mapping allows is interesting in more than one way: its flexibility
  provides a space for both individual and collective reflection; it allows identification
  and structuring of the crucial dimensions of an issue; and the research outcomes
  are useful both to researchers and participants in guiding action and achieving
  goals. Social actors can therefore benefit from a collective dynamic to reflect
  on the foundations for the development and organization of health services in French.OBJECTIVE:
