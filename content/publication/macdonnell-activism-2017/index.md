abstract: Although immigrant women bear a disproportionate burden of chronic disease
  and mental health issues, limited research addresses how to promote their mental
  wellbeing. The authors first describe grounded theory findings from community-based
  focus group research with 57 racialized immigrant women in Toronto, Canada that
  used a critical gender and intersectional lens to explore the links among settlement,
  wellbeing, and activism. Secondly, a community mobilization strategy is described
  whereby racialized immigrant women discuss activism as a feature of wellbeing in
  various language communities while creating meaningful health promotion resources.
  Implications for creating activism-based initiatives to promote women's wellbeing
  are discussed.
