abstract: 'Studies examining the health of public housing residents are limited. In
  response, community-based participatory research principles were used to develop
  an intervention aimed at improving health outcomes related to multifactorial risk
  behaviors among Latino families living in a low-income neighborhood. A two-part
  needs assessment was completed to guide the intervention: interviews with parents
  (n = 10) and a group model building (GMB) workshop with youth and parents (n = 40)
  to explore the parent-youth dynamic. Interviews indicated that poverty, youth disobedience,
  and inadequate communication between parents and youth led to parental stress. During
  the workshop, balancing and reinforcing feedback loops involving Communication,
  Trust, and Respect between youth and parents were identified. Based on these findings
  and collaboration with a community advisory board, a bilingual, mindfulness-based
  meditation intervention was designed to address community needs: positive parent-child
  interaction emphasizing trust and communication, stress reduction, and family well-being.'
