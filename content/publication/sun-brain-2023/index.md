abstract: How do early bilingual experiences influence children's neural architecture
  for word processing? Dual language acquisition can yield common influences that
  may be shared across different bilingual groups, as well as language-specific influences
  stemming from a given language pairing. To investigate these effects, we examined
  bilingual English speakers of Chinese or Spanish, and English monolinguals, all
  raised in the US (N = 152, ages 5-10). Children completed an English morphological
  word processing task during fNIRS neuroimaging. The findings revealed both language-specific
  and shared bilingual effects. The language-specific effects were that Chinese and
  Spanish bilinguals showed principled differences in their neural organization for
  English lexical morphology. The common bilingual effects shared by the two groups
  were that in both bilingual groups, increased home language proficiency was associated
  with stronger left superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation when processing the
  English word structures that are most dissimilar from the home language. The findings
  inform theories of language and brain development during the key periods of neural
  reorganization for learning to read by illuminating experience-based plasticity
  in linguistically diverse learners. Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Developmental
