abstract: Research shows that vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
  is one of the most effective methods for reducing risk for cervical cancer; it also
  protects against other HPV-related cancers. Controversies exist regarding HPV vaccination
  in several communities; which may in part explain why although rates of HPV vaccination
  are increasing nationwide, Los Angeles County (LAC) data show that many adolescents
  are still not vaccinated. These adolescents remain at high-risk for infection. Using
  community-based participatory principles, we conducted an environmental scan that
  included a literature review, the development of a community advisory board, community
  feedback from HPV community meetings, and interviews with stakeholders to understand
  attitudes toward HPV vaccination and their impact in follow through with HPV vaccines.
  Twenty-eight key stakeholders participated in our coalition comprised of community
  organizations and clinics with strong ties to the local community. This is the only
  coalition dedicated exclusively to improving HPV vaccine uptake in LAC. Of these,
  twenty-one participated in an environmental scan via qualitative interviews about
  HPV vaccination programs, service delivery priorities, and proposed steps to increase
  HPV vaccination uptake in LAC. The environmental scan revealed targets for future
  efforts, barriers to HPV uptake, and next steps for improving local HPV vaccination
  uptake rates. The environmental scan also identified local HPV vaccination interventions
  and resources. Although LAC has developed important efforts for vaccination, some
  interventions are no longer being implemented due to lack of funds; others have
  not been evaluated with sufficient outcome data. The risk for cervical and other
  HPV-related cancers could be greatly reduced in LAC if a multilevel, multicultural,
  and multilingual approach is taken to better understand rates of HPV vaccination
  uptake, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities and LGBTQ youth. Our environmental
  scan provides guidance on attitudes toward vaccination, and how best to address
  the needs of LAC families and providers.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd
