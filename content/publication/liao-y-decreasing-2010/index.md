abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Highly controlled research projects demonstrated success in
  preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases. Community-based programs have
  yet to demonstrate significant influence. Data on large-scale community-level interventions
  targeting minority communities are limited. The aim of this study is to measure
  the impact of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH 2010)
  project, a community-based intervention to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in
  blood cholesterol screening in minority communities. METHODS: Annual survey data
  from 2001 to 2006 were gathered in 22 communities. Trends in the prevalence of age-standardised
  blood cholesterol screening were examined for four racial/ethnic groups (black,
  Hispanic, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native), stratified by education level,
  and compared with national data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
  RESULTS: The prevalence of cholesterol screening increased among persons in black,
  Hispanic and Asian REACH communities (ptextless0.001), whereas prevalence decreased
  in the total US and Hispanic populations (ptextless0.001) and remained similar among
  blacks and Asians nationwide. The relative disparity between the total US population
  and most REACH communities decreased (ptextless0.05). Relative disparity in cholesterol
  screening related to education level decreased (ptextless0.05) within REACH communities,
  whereas relative disparity related to education level nationwide remained similar
  in blacks and increased (ptextless0.001) in Hispanics. CONCLUSION: The REACH project
  decreased racial and ethnic disparities in cholesterol screening between REACH communities
  and the total US population, as well as disparities related to education level within
  REACH communities.'
