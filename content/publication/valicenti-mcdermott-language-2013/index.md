abstract: Bilingualism is common worldwide and increasingly prevalent, but there is
  little information about bilingual children with autism spectrum disorder. The goal
  of the study was to compare expressive and receptive language skills in monolingual
  English and bilingual English-Spanish children with autism spectrum disorder. A
  review of the multidisciplinary evaluations done in toddlers who were diagnosed
  with autism spectrum disorder at a university-affiliated center between 2003 and
  2010 was performed. Data included demographics, developmental testing, autistic
  characteristics, and expressive and receptive language skills, obtained from formal
  speech and language evaluation. A total of 80 toddlers were identified, 40 classified
  as bilingual English-Spanish. Compared with monolinguals, bilingual children were
  more likely to vocalize and utilize gestures, with no other differences in language
  skills. There were no differences in cognitive functioning and autistic features
  between the groups. In this study, bilingualism did not negatively affect language
  development in young children with autism spectrum disorder.
