abstract: Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding
  the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories
  of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences
  between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter
  volume (GMV) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain
  analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have
  led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in
  an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry
  (VBM) studies of GMV for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects
  in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across
  eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe
  of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the
  analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis.
  This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is
  considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual
  brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and
  interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and
  surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with
  bilingualism across the lifespan.
