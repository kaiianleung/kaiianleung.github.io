abstract: Community-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing at religious
  congregations has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase screening
  among disproportionately affected populations, such as those self-identifying as
  African American and Latino. Although congregations may provide reach into these
  communities, the extent to which church-based HIV testing alleviates access barriers,
  identifies new cases, and reaches people at increased risk for HIV is not well documented.
  We examined the results of an HIV testing program that was conducted as part of
  a larger intervention aimed at reducing HIV stigma at five churches in Los Angeles
  County, California, in 2011-2012. HIV screening identified one positive result in
  323 tests but reached a substantial proportion of people who had not been tested
  before, including many who lacked health insurance. Although this approach may not
  be an efficient way to identify cases of previously unknown HIV infection, it could
  help achieve universal testing goals.Copyright Â© 2016, Association of Schools and
