abstract: The present paper accentuates the need for innovation in pedagogical theory
  and practice of the day. It elucidates the linguistic dilemma of the present times
  and identifies space for bilingualism and pluriculturalism. To make the readers
  acquainted with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), the authors corroborate
  the detailed theoretical framework by establishing links with growing trends of
  cross continent migration, rising globalisation and expansion of multicultural and
  multiethnic contexts in the educational arena. A brief prehistory of CLIL has also
  been explored to justify its birth in helping out the linguists and educationists
  in Europe and beyond. The paper delineates the theory of Content and Language Integrated
  Learning (CLIL) diagrammatically employing content, cognition and communication
  in a linguistic culture. It explicates the various nomenclatures, dimensions, functions
  and the developmental stages of CLIL pedagogy at the dawn of the new millennium.
  After exploring the theoretical, functional and futuristic facets of CLIL, it is
  concluded that CLIL is an apt, economical and timely framework of bringing diverse
  cultures and languages closer to one another and can help build cosmopolitan identity
  of learners in the Knowledge Age.
