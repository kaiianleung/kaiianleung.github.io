 abstract = {Objectives To test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of CuidaTEXT: a tailored text message intervention to support Latino dementia family caregivers.Methods CuidaTEXT is a six-month, bilingual, and bidirectional intervention tailored to caregiver needs (e.g., education, problem-solving, resources). We enrolled 24 Latino caregivers in a one-arm trial, and assessed feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy within six months.Results Recruitment took 61 days and enrollment took 20. None of the participants unsubscribed from CuidaTEXT, and 83.3% completed the follow up survey. Most participants (85.7%) reported reading most text messages thoroughly. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the intervention (3.6 on a scale from 1 to 4). CuidaTEXT helpfulness was high (3.5-3.8 on a 1 to 4 scale). Compared to baseline, at six months caregiver behavioral symptom distress (0–60) decreased from 19.8 to 12.0, and depression (0-30) from 8.8 to 5.4 (p&lt;0.05).Conclusions CuidaTEXT demonstrated high levels of feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy among Latino caregivers.Clinical implications CuidaTEXT’s feasibility and potential for widespread implementation holds promise in supporting Latino caregivers of people with dementia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNCT04418232Funding StatementThis work was supported by Grants R21 AG065755, K01 MD014177, and P30 AG072973 from the NIH.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethics committee/IRB of the University of Kansas Medical Center gave ethical approval for this work I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
