abstract: 'The imminent thrust of globalization is equally challenging but promising.
  The role of translators in various walks of life – law, medicine, and education,
  among others – has become indispensable and crucial both socially and economically.
  The Saudi translation industry is self-supporting because it is not much governed
  by prevailing regulations. Hence, translation agencies thrive based on the fundamental
  principles and practices of the market. Competence defines the game, and training
  improves the performance of each player. It is the main objective of this study
  to identify the training needs of professional Saudi translators. Improving translation
  competency can be catered through effective training where needs analysis comes
  as its preliminary and integral requirement. This study has involved 166 professional
  translators and 20 owner-managers from the biggest translation agencies in Riyadh,
  Saudi Arabia. Leaning on quantitative and qualitative data gathered from them, the
  essential factors for translator training were derived, to wit: translation fundamentals,
  extra-linguistic abilities, and bilingualism. Having arrived at these findings,
  this study hopes to meaningfully contribute to the design and development of effective
  translator trainings.'
