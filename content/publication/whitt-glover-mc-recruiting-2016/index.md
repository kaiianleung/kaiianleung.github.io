abstract: Physical activity among African Americans (AA) is low; effective intervention
  strategies are needed. Community-based settings are useful for delivering health-related
  interventions in racial/ethnic minority communities. This article describes strategies
  used to recruit churches for participation in a 22-month intervention designed to
  increase physical activity levels in AA women. Initial recruitment efforts, led
  by AA study staff, included direct mailers, phone calls, and in-person meetings
  with church representatives. After 10 months, only five churches were enrolled.
  Seven community members with existing partnerships/contacts in the faith community
  were subsequently hired and an additional 26 churches were enrolled within 6 months.
  Overall response rate was 45%, and churches required 3.5 +/- 3.0 months of multiple
  contacts prior to enrollment. The main primary contacts within churches were individuals
  with personal interest in the program and pastors. Prior relationship between the
  research team and churches did not appear to influence church enrollment as much
  as community member recruiters. The current study identifies several potential strategies
  that may be useful for increasing success in efforts to recruit AA churches into
  studies. Additional research is warranted that tests and compares a variety of recruitment
  strategies to determine the most successful strategies for recruitment in different
  populations. Copyright Â© 2015 Society for Public Health Education.
