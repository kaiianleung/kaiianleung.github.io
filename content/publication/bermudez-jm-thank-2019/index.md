abstract: When working with clients in another language, having culturally relevant
  and properly translated clinic materials is vital to effective clinical practice.
  Not having them presents a barrier for bilingual therapists and their clients. This
  paper reviews common translation methods and introduces a multi-level, community-based
  approach for translating clinic materials for non-English speaking clients. Informed
  by decolonizing practices, this five-tier method includes members from the target
  community as cultural brokers to verify the accuracy and nuances of language for
  their cultural group, as well as a constant comparative method to ensure methodological
  rigor in the process of inclusion. We present community member's feedback and recommendations,
  as well as discuss advantages and challenges of using this collaborative culturally
  responsive translation method.Copyright Â© 2018 American Association for Marriage
