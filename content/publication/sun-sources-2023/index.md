abstract: Diversity and variation in language experiences, such as bilingualism, contribute
  to heterogeneity in children's neural organization for language and brain development.
  To uncover sources of such heterogeneity in children's neural language networks,
  the present study examined the effects of bilingual proficiency on children's neural
  organization for language function. To do so, we took an innovative person-specific
  analytical approach to investigate young Chinese-English and Spanish-English bilingual
  learners of structurally distinct languages. Bilingual and English monolingual children
  (N = 152, M(SD)age = 7.71(1.32)) completed an English word recognition task during
  functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging, along with language and literacy
  tasks in each of their languages. Two key findings emerged. First, bilinguals' heritage
  language proficiency (Chinese or Spanish) made a unique contribution to children's
  language network density. Second, the findings reveal common and unique patterns
  in children's patterns of task-related functional connectivity. Common across all
  participants were short-distance neural connections within left hemisphere regions
  associated with semantic processes (within middle temporal and frontal regions).
  Unique to more proficient language users were additional long-distance connections
  between frontal, temporal, and bilateral regions within the broader language network.
  The study informs neurodevelopmental theories of language by revealing the effects
  of heterogeneity in language proficiency and experiences on the structure and quality
  of emerging language neural networks in linguistically diverse learners. Copyright
