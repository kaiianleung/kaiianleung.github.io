abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: The Marshallese population suffers from disproportionate rates
  of type 2 diabetes. This study identifies the underlying beliefs and perceptions
  that affect diabetes self-management behavior in the US Marshallese population living
  in Arkansas., METHODS: The study employs focus groups with a semi-structured interview
  guide developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and
  the Health Belief Model. Data were collected from 41 participants; bilingual community
  co-investigators provided translation as needed., RESULTS: The results show high-perceived
  threat, with most participants describing diabetes as inevitable and a death sentence.
  Participants are generally unaware of the benefits of diabetes self-management behaviors,
  and the Marshallese population faces significant policy, environmental, and systems
  barriers to diabetes self-management. The primary cue to action is a diagnosis of
  diabetes, and there are varying levels of self-efficacy., CONCLUSIONS: The research
  grounded in the Health Belief Model provides important contributions that can help
  advance diabetes self-management efforts within Pacific Islander communities.'
