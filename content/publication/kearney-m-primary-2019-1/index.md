abstract: 'Comprehensive strategies for prescription drug misuse must reach culturally
  and linguistically diverse suburban populations to effectively combat the ongoing
  opioid epidemic. The purpose of this study was to conduct a community needs assessment
  and inform the development and implementation of culturally appropriate primary
  prevention strategies for community-based interventions, specifically related to
  medication disposal practices. Three data collection techniques were utilized: key
  informant interviews (n=4), intercept surveys (n=71), and focus group discussions
  (n=8; 61 participants). To accommodate linguistically diverse subpopulations, surveys
  and focus groups were available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, and Hindi.
  Participants were overwhelmingly female (survey: 70%/FGD: 84%), ethnic minorities
  (survey: 61%/FGD: 66%), and, on average, middle-aged [survey: 52 years (SD: 19)/FGD:
  54 (15)]. Approximately one in three survey respondents (30%) had heard of drug-take
  back events, and one in ten (10%) had participated. Non-English speakers were less
  likely to both perceive a community problem with prescription drugs (beta=-.35;
  ptextless.001) and be aware of take-back opportunities (beta=-.23; p=.038). Focus
  group participants expressed confusion about appropriate medication disposal methods,
  identifying potential sources of conflicting information. Recent media coverage
  and political events have heightened stigma towards non-English speaking and non-native
  peoples, increasing their fear of law enforcement and other perceived threats. To
  encourage community engagement in take-back events, we identified multiple ways,
  such as multilingual materials and marketing campaigns, which may help marginalized
  suburban subpopulations feel less threatened and more included in prescription drug
  misuse prevention activities.'
