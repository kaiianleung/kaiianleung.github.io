abstract: "BACKGROUND: The sickest Australians are often those belonging to non-privileged
  groups, including Indigenous Australians, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, intersex
  and queer people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds,
  socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and people with disabilities and low English
  literacy. These consumers are not always engaged by, or included within, mainstream
  health services, particularly in rural Australia where health services are limited
  in number and tend to be generalist in nature., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
  was to present a new approach for improving the sociocultural inclusivity of mainstream,
  generalist, rural, health care organisations., DESIGN: This approach combines a
  modified Continuous Quality Improvement framework with Participatory Action Research
  principles and Foucault's concepts of power, discourse and resistance to develop
  a change process that deconstructs the power relations that currently exclude marginalised
  rural health consumers from mainstream health services. It sets up processes for
  continuous learning and consumer responsiveness., RESULTS: The approach proposed
  could provide a Continuous Quality Improvement process for creating more inclusive
  mainstream health institutions and fostering better engagement with many marginalised
  groups in rural communities to improve their access to health care., CONCLUSION:
  The approach to improving cultural inclusion in mainstream rural health services
  presented in this article builds on existing initiatives. This approach focuses
  on engaging on-the-ground staff in the need for change and preparing the service
  for genuine community consultation and responsive change. It is currently being
  trialled and evaluated.Copyright Â© 2018 National Rural Health Alliance Ltd."
