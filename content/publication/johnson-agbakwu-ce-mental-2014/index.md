abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression are common
  mental health disorders in the refugee population. High rates of violence, trauma,
  and PTSD among refugee women remain unaddressed. The process of implementing a mental
  health screening tool among multiethnic, newly arrived refugee women receiving routine
  obstetric and gynecologic care in a dedicated refugee women's health clinic is described.
  The Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15) is a culturally responsive, efficient, validated
  screening instrument that detects symptoms of emotional distress across diverse
  refugee populations and languages. An interdisciplinary community partnership was
  established with a local behavioral health services agency to facilitate the referral
  of women scoring positive on the RHS-15. Staff and provider training sessions, as
  well as the incorporation of bicultural, multilingual cultural health navigators,
  greatly facilitated linguistically appropriate care coordination for refugee women
  in a culturally sensitive manner. Twenty-six (23.2%) of the 112 women who completed
  the RHS-15 scored positive, of which 14 (53.8%) were Iraqi, 1 (3.8%) was Burmese,
  and 3 (11.5%) were Somali. Among these 26 women, 8 (30.8%) are actively receiving
  mental health services and 5 (19.2%) have appointments scheduled. However, 13 (50%)
  are not enrolled in mental health care because of either declining services (46.2%)
  or a lack of insurance (53.8%). Screening for mental disorders among refugee women
  will promote greater awareness and identify those individuals who would benefit
  from further mental health evaluation and treatment. Sustainable interdisciplinary
  models of care are necessary to promote health education, dispel myths, and reduce
  the stigma of mental health.Copyright (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all
