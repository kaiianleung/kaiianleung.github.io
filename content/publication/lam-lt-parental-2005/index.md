abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: This cross-sectional community-based randomized telephone
  survey, aimed to compare the parental risk perceptions on childhood pedestrian road
  safety among three different major community language speaking groups and the mainstream
  English speaking Australians in Sydney, Australia. METHOD(S): This was a community-based
  telephone survey with subjects randomly selected from the population of specific
  cultural languages in Sydney. RESULT(S): Results indicated that Chinese and Arabic
  speaking parents or caregivers perceived the road environments as significantly
  less hazardous for their 4-12 year old children as pedestrians when compared with
  Vietnamese and English speaking parents. This was true even after adjusting for
  the age of child, socioeconomic status, and the living environments of respondents.
  CONCLUSION(S): The implication of the results was discussed in light of possible
  application to childhood safety behavior across different cultures. IMPACT TO THE
  INDUSTRY: The results obtained have highlighted the importance of cultural factors
  in risk perceptions, and safety behaviors. Cultural differences in risk perceptions
  should be taken into consideration in the design of safety education programs.'
