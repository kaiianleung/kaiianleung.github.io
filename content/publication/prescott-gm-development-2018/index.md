abstract: "Objectives: To develop a community-based educational workshop to improve
  medication health literacy in refugees. Setting(s): Workshops were provided in community
  locations including a local resettlement agency and English as a Second Language
  facility. Practice description: Pharmacy faculty mentored small group student workshop
  presentations to recently arrived refugees regarding medication health literacy
  topics. Practice innovation: A program was developed to use translated materials,
  interpreters, hands-on materials, and evaluations to teach refugees about medication-related
  issues. A needs assessment was conducted with a local refugee resettlement agency
  to determine topics. Evaluation: Evaluations were administered after the workshop
  to ensure understanding of the workshop material. Verbal feedback and faculty oversight
  during interactions between pharmacy students and refugees in addition to evaluation
  responses were used for quality improvement. Result(s): Workshop materials have
  been translated into 11 of the most common languages for our local refugee population.
  Twelve workshops were administered during the past year and a half, educating 282
  refugees from 33 countries. There was an average of 78% correct responses on postevaluation
  questions assessing refugees' understanding of workshop concepts. Verbal feedback
  from the refugees supported an increase in knowledge regarding how to open a medication
  bottle, how to read medication labels, and how to dose liquid medications. Conclusion(s):
  Implementation of this health literacy program allowed us to address medication-related
  concerns with refugees. Working within the community setting provided a learning
  environment in which the refugees trusted the workers and were comfortable asking
  questions. Small group settings and evaluation allowed us to review concepts until
  proficiency was achieved.Copyright Â© 2018"
