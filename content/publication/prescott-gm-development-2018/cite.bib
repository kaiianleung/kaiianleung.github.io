 abstract = {Objectives: To develop a community-based educational workshop to improve medication health literacy in refugees. Setting(s): Workshops were provided in community locations including a local resettlement agency and English as a Second Language facility. Practice description: Pharmacy faculty mentored small group student workshop presentations to recently arrived refugees regarding medication health literacy topics. Practice innovation: A program was developed to use translated materials, interpreters, hands-on materials, and evaluations to teach refugees about medication-related issues. A needs assessment was conducted with a local refugee resettlement agency to determine topics. Evaluation: Evaluations were administered after the workshop to ensure understanding of the workshop material. Verbal feedback and faculty oversight during interactions between pharmacy students and refugees in addition to evaluation responses were used for quality improvement. Result(s): Workshop materials have been translated into 11 of the most common languages for our local refugee population. Twelve workshops were administered during the past year and a half, educating 282 refugees from 33 countries. There was an average of 78% correct responses on postevaluation questions assessing refugees' understanding of workshop concepts. Verbal feedback from the refugees supported an increase in knowledge regarding how to open a medication bottle, how to read medication labels, and how to dose liquid medications. Conclusion(s): Implementation of this health literacy program allowed us to address medication-related concerns with refugees. Working within the community setting provided a learning environment in which the refugees trusted the workers and were comfortable asking questions. Small group settings and evaluation allowed us to review concepts until proficiency was achieved.Copyright Â© 2018},
