abstract: 'Functional specialization and plasticity are fundamental organizing principles
  of the brain. Since the mid-1800s, certain cognitive functions have been known to
  be lateralized, but the provenance and flexibility of hemispheric specialization
  remain open questions. Language is a uniquely human phenomenon that requires a delicate
  balance between neural specialization and plasticity, and language learning offers
  the perfect window to study these principles in the human brain. In the current
  study, we conducted two separate functional MRI experiments with language learners
  (male and female), one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, involving distinct
  populations and languages, and examined hemispheric lateralization and learning-dependent
  plasticity of the following three language systems: reading, speech comprehension,
  and verbal production. A multipronged analytic approach revealed a highly consistent
  pattern of results across the two experiments, showing (1) that in both native and
  non-native languages, while language production was left lateralized, lateralization
  for language comprehension was highly variable across individuals; and (2) that
  with increasing non-native language proficiency, reading and speech comprehension
  displayed substantial changes in hemispheric dominance, with languages tending to
  lateralize to opposite hemispheres, while production showed negligible change and
  remained left lateralized. These convergent results shed light on the long-standing
  debate of neural organization of language by establishing robust principles of lateralization
  and plasticity of the main language systems. Findings further suggest involvement
  of the sensorimotor systems in language lateralization and its plasticity. SIGNIFICANCE
  STATEMENT The human brain exhibits a remarkable ability to support a vast variety
  of languages that may be acquired at different points in the life span. Language
  is a complex construct involving linguistic as well as visual, auditory, and motor
  processes. Using functional MRI, we examined hemispheric specialization and learning-dependent
  plasticity of three language systems-reading, speech comprehension, and verbal production-in
  cross-sectional and longitudinal experiments in language learners. A multipronged
  analytic approach revealed converging evidence for striking differences in hemispheric
  specialization and plasticity among the language systems. The results have major
  theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of fundamental principles
  of neural organization of language, language testing and recovery in patients, and
  language learning in healthy populations. Copyright © 2020 Gurunandan et al.'
