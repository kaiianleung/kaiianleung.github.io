abstract: Recently, the field of Community Occupational Therapy has started to enter
  into new research areas, one being participatory research. This paper illustrates
  a participatory research methodology adapted by community residents and a research
  team to identify the service needs of an underserved Hispanic population as well
  as set action agendas to meet their needs. In order to plan and implement health
  programs, community residents participated actively in the needs assessment, action
  agenda development and brainstorming of solutions to address health and community
  needs and concerns. Concerns identified included the lack of affordable bilingual
  dentists and youth involvement in gangs, drugs, and alcohol. The results of the
  needs assessment were shared and discussed during five public forums in which 180
  Hispanics from the community discussed the dimensions of the issues and alternative
  solutions. This process resulted in an agenda of health issues and ideas for improvement
  from the perspective of Hispanics. We emphasized the advantages of using participatory
  methodologies when developing health and community services within Hispanic communities.
  Additionally, the implications for advancing a Scholarship of Practice agenda for
  Community Occupational Therapy are discussed. Â© 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.
