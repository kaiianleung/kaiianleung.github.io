abstract: "AIMS: The study aim was to examine the impact of a home-based programme
  intervention on organizational contexts, implementation processes and organizational
  capacity outcomes from multicultural, multilingual participants working at community-based
  organizations. DESIGN: This was a sequential exploratory, mixed-methods longitudinal
  study using community-based participatory research principles. SAMPLE: Twenty participants
  from nine multicultural, multilingual community-based organizations were in this
  public health initiative's intervention to develop community-designed, home-based
  programmes. METHOD(S): Capacity building providers delivered the intervention selected
  by the funders. Workshop outcomes were descriptively measured in April/May 2019.
  In April/May and November 2019, participants completed surveys about organizational
  contexts, implementation processes and organizational capacity outcomes, which were
  analysed with t-tests using the organization as the unit of analysis. Qualitative
  data were analysed using content analysis. RESULT(S): Seven programmes were new
  and two were modified. As workshop outcomes, 59% of participants reported increased
  overall implementation knowledge and 74% reported capacity building providers as
  the most helpful resource. After 6 to 7months, no statistically significant changes
  were noted in organizational contexts, implementation processes or organizational
  capacity outcomes. Participants benefited from capacity building because they had
  programmes developed, formed partnerships with capacity building providers, gained
  implementation knowledge, and engaged in networking. CONCLUSION(S): Participants
  reported excellent individual and organizational strengths. Many Initiative factors
  contributed to no statistical changes. Namely, there was no opportunity for baseline
  data; limited community-based organization engagement in the intervention model
  selection, timeline and processes; the Initiative's timeline did not fit participants'
  timeline; insufficient time to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate
  programmes; late literature review abstracts; lack of adequate, planful and paid
  capacity building time; and a contract requirement to have the programme due when
  it was not implementable. These Initiative design factors, as reported by participants,
  limited the Initiative's home-based programme development. IMPACT: This study highlights
  the strengths of participants, community-based organizations and capacity building
  providers. Model selection, timeline and budget were identified as key factors for
  equitable implementation in multicultural, multilingual organizations.Copyright
