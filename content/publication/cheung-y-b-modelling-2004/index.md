abstract: 'Background and objectives: Modelling variability of quality of life scores
  can not only improve our understanding of the characteristics of the measurement
  tools, but also shed light on sample size requirements. Although the English and
  Chinese versions of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) are commonly considered
  equivalent, they have not been compared in terms of variability. Furthermore, bilingual
  and monolingual persons may differ in cognition and responses to questionnaires.
  Method(s): In a community-based survey of quality of life in Singapore, a society
  where both English and Chinese are widely used and bilingualism is prevalent, 2590
  respondents answered either version of the SF-36. We studied the impact of questionnaire
  version and bilingualism on the variability of SF-36 scores by regression modelling,
  with adjustment for covariates. Result(s): The Chinese version had smaller variances
  in the physical functioning (PF) and the physical component summary scores than
  the English version. The variance ratios (VRs) were respectively 0.32 and 0.60 (each
  p textless 0.01), controlling for covariates. Bilingualism was not associated with
  variability in SF-36 scores except PF (VR = 0.78; p textless 0.05). Conclusion(s):
  As a result of a smaller variance, using the Chinese version of SF-36 among bilingual
  Chinese people may require a smaller sample size than using the English version.'
