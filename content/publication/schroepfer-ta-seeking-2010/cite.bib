 abstract = {Compared to white non-Hispanics, Hmong report higher incidence rates of certain cancers and present at an advanced stage. Using a community-based participatory research approach, Hmong leaders partnered with academic researchers to assess the Wisconsin Hmong population's readiness to address cancer. Using the Colorado Tri-Ethnic Center's Community Readiness Assessment, face-to-face interviews were conducted with eight Hmong leaders. The stage of readiness to address cancer was "Vague Awareness". Six thematic areas provided insight into this stage and recommendations for effective intervention. Results emphasize the need for a bridge between Hmong and mainstream communities to provide basic, culturally appropriate education on the US healthcare system and cancer. Â© 2010 Springer.},
