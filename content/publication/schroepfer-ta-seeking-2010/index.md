abstract: Compared to white non-Hispanics, Hmong report higher incidence rates of
  certain cancers and present at an advanced stage. Using a community-based participatory
  research approach, Hmong leaders partnered with academic researchers to assess the
  Wisconsin Hmong population's readiness to address cancer. Using the Colorado Tri-Ethnic
  Center's Community Readiness Assessment, face-to-face interviews were conducted
  with eight Hmong leaders. The stage of readiness to address cancer was \"Vague Awareness\".
  Six thematic areas provided insight into this stage and recommendations for effective
  intervention. Results emphasize the need for a bridge between Hmong and mainstream
  communities to provide basic, culturally appropriate education on the US healthcare
  system and cancer. Â© 2010 Springer.
