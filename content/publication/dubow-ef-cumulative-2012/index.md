abstract: We examine cumulative and prospective effects of exposure to conflict and
  violence across four contexts (ethnic-political, community, family, school) on posttraumatic
  stress (PTS) symptoms in Palestinian and Israeli youth. Interviews were conducted
  with 600 Palestinian and 901 Israeli (Jewish and Arab) children (ages 8, 11, and
  14) and their parents once a year for 3 consecutive years. Palestinian children,
  males, and older youth were generally at greatest risk for exposure to conflict/violence
  across contexts. Regression analysis found unique effects of exposure to ethnic-political
  (Palestinian sample), school (Palestinian and Israeli Jewish samples), and family
  conflict/violence (Israeli Arab sample) during the first 2 years on PTS symptoms
  in Year 3, controlling for prior PTS symptoms. Cumulative exposure to violence in
  more contexts during the first 2 years predicted higher subsequent PTS symptoms
  than did exposure to violence in fewer contexts, and this was true regardless of
  the youth's level of prior PTS symptoms. These results highlight the risk that ongoing
  exposure to violence across multiple contexts in the social ecology poses for the
  mental health of children in contexts of ethnic-political violence. Researchers
  and mental health professionals working with war-exposed youth in a given cultural
  context must assess both war- and non-war-related stressors affecting youth. Based
  on this assessment, interventions may not be limited to individual-based, war-trauma-focused
  approaches but also may include school-based, community-based, and family-level
  interventions. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
