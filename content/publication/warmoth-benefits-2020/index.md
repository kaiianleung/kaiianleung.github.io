abstract: Breast cancer survivors report persistent psychological and physical symptoms,
  which affect their quality of life and may challenge the recovery process. Due to
  social, cultural, and linguistic barriers, culturally sensitive care is largely
  unavailable for Chinese Americans, and their psychological needs are not often addressed.
  We aimed to investigate whether the Joy Luck Academy (JLA), a psychosocial intervention
  providing both information and peer support, was associated with positive adjustment
  among Chinese American breast cancer survivors. Thirty-nine Chinese American breast
  cancer survivors participated in a pilot psychosocial intervention. The educational
  materials and lectures were delivered in the participants' native language of Chinese.
  All of the educators and mentors shared the same linguistic and cultural background
  with the participants. The program utilized a community-based participatory research
  (CBPR) approach to further enhance the cultural sensitivity of the intervention.
  Participants' post-traumatic growth and positive affect were assessed before and
  after the intervention. The JLA showed an improvement in positive affect, and they
  had a greater appreciation for life. The intervention was found to be feasible,
  well-accepted, and beneficial for this population. Chinese American breast cancer
  survivors reported improved psychological health after attending the intervention.
  These findings encourage the development and implementation of psychosocial interventions
  for Chinese breast cancer survivors. Similar programs could be integrated into other
  ethnic or cultural communities.
