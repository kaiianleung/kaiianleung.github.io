abstract: "BACKGROUND: As posited in multiple health communication theories, it is
  vital to understand modern health communication preferences among communities in
  order to develop tailored interventions to reduce Infant Mortality (IM). Literature
  suggests that health communication inequalities play an important role in infant
  health knowledge gaps, thus contributing to the disparate IM rates. We sought to
  understand preferred methods of communication among expectant or mothers of young
  children of varying sociodemographics. We hypothesized that methods of communication
  would vary by sociodemographics., METHODS: A bilingual questionnaire, developed
  using community based participatory research principles was offered at pre-selected
  women's health agencies in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Participants chose
  from a researched list of 22 methods of communication and also designated their
  \\\"top three choices.\\\" Communication methods were compared across sociodemographics
  using chi-squared statistical tests., RESULTS: A total of 292 participants completed
  the questionnaire at the various sites. Participants were predominantly White (60%)
  or Hispanic/Latina (30%), and lived in Frederick county/Winchester city (77%). Of
  the 22 communication methods, the five most prevalent were: talking with a healthcare
  provider (91%), family or friends (85-87%), using internet (84%), and handouts/booklets
  (80%). Communication methods most frequently chosen as a \\\"top three choice\\\"\
  \ were: internet (46%), talking with healthcare providers (33%), and talking with
  family (32%). A higher preference for talking with a healthcare provider was noted
  among higher income individuals (100%) compared to lower income (82%; p-value=0.0062),
  a higher preference for call-in hotlines among Hispanic (49%) vs. non-Hispanic women
  (15%; p-valuetextless0.0001), and a higher preference for placemats at fast-food
  restaurants among older women (42%) compared to younger (16%, p-value=0.0361).,
  CONCLUSION: Results suggest the incorporation of multiple methods may be a practical
  approach to reaching different segments of the population including those identified
  as most vulnerable for infant mortality."
