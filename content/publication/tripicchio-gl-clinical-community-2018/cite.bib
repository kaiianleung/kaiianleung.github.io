 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical-community collaboration is a promising strategy for pediatric obesity treatment, but current research is limited. This study examined the effect of a family-based treatment program embedded in a primary care clinic on retention and changes in child weight status at 1 year. METHOD(S): Children (2-16 years, BMI \textgreater=85th percentile, 87.0% Hispanic) and their parents were recruited from a single pediatric clinic for Healthy Hawks Primary Plus (HHP+). Children were referred by physicians and enrolled by a bilingual clinic-based recruitment coordinator. Participants received 12 weekly 2-hour sessions focused on lifestyle modification and health behavior change and then received bimonthly follow-up visits with their clinic-based physician through 1-year follow-up. Child body mass index (BMI) percentage of the 95th percentile (%BMIp95) was measured as the primary outcome at baseline, postintervention, and 1-year follow-up. Random effect multilevel models assessed changes in child weight status over time accounting for clustering by family. To further evaluate the impact, HHP+ retention and changes in child weight status were compared to a standard 12-week treatment program only. RESULT(S): HHP+ participants had significantly better retention at 1 year (73.9%, p\textless=0.001) compared to the standard treatment program (38.3%). In HHP+, physician visit attendance was significantly correlated with retention at 1 year (r=0.69, p\textless=0.001), and HHP+ completers had significant reductions in %BMIp95 between baseline and 1-year follow-up (p=0.03). CONCLUSION(S): Clinical-community partnerships might be a promising strategy to improve retention and reduce child weight status in populations currently underrepresented in obesity treatment.},
