abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinical-community collaboration is a promising strategy for
  pediatric obesity treatment, but current research is limited. This study examined
  the effect of a family-based treatment program embedded in a primary care clinic
  on retention and changes in child weight status at 1 year. METHOD(S): Children (2-16
  years, BMI textgreater=85th percentile, 87.0% Hispanic) and their parents were recruited
  from a single pediatric clinic for Healthy Hawks Primary Plus (HHP+). Children were
  referred by physicians and enrolled by a bilingual clinic-based recruitment coordinator.
  Participants received 12 weekly 2-hour sessions focused on lifestyle modification
  and health behavior change and then received bimonthly follow-up visits with their
  clinic-based physician through 1-year follow-up. Child body mass index (BMI) percentage
  of the 95th percentile (%BMIp95) was measured as the primary outcome at baseline,
  postintervention, and 1-year follow-up. Random effect multilevel models assessed
  changes in child weight status over time accounting for clustering by family. To
  further evaluate the impact, HHP+ retention and changes in child weight status were
  compared to a standard 12-week treatment program only. RESULT(S): HHP+ participants
  had significantly better retention at 1 year (73.9%, ptextless=0.001) compared to
  the standard treatment program (38.3%). In HHP+, physician visit attendance was
  significantly correlated with retention at 1 year (r=0.69, ptextless=0.001), and
  HHP+ completers had significant reductions in %BMIp95 between baseline and 1-year
  follow-up (p=0.03). CONCLUSION(S): Clinical-community partnerships might be a promising
  strategy to improve retention and reduce child weight status in populations currently
  underrepresented in obesity treatment.'
