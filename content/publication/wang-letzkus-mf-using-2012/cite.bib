 abstract = {The purpose of this article is to share culturally competent strategies and lessons learned from a study that used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach with older adult diabetic Chinese Americans. This approach was essential to gain insight into the health beliefs, attitudes, and practices of selected communities. The vulnerable population conceptual model (VPCM) provided a framework for the study. The CBPR, a collaborative research approach, and the VPCM provided the basis for the development of culturally competent research strategies. Strategies and lessons learned to be particularly effective for this CBPR study included (a) developing an in-depth understanding of the community ethnic culture; (b) developing mutual respect and trust with community members and study participants; (c) appreciating and praising community partners' knowledge, expertise, and experiences; (d) developing a sense of ownership by incorporating their needs, ideas, suggestions, and opinions and empowering study participants to make decisions concerning the study approach and wording; (e) soliciting participant feedback and clarification of study results and involving them in disseminating the study findings to their community; and (f) having fun with them and encouraging them to have fun.
