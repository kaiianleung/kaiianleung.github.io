abstract: The purpose of this article is to share culturally competent strategies
  and lessons learned from a study that used a community-based participatory research
  (CBPR) approach with older adult diabetic Chinese Americans. This approach was essential
  to gain insight into the health beliefs, attitudes, and practices of selected communities.
  The vulnerable population conceptual model (VPCM) provided a framework for the study.
  The CBPR, a collaborative research approach, and the VPCM provided the basis for
  the development of culturally competent research strategies. Strategies and lessons
  learned to be particularly effective for this CBPR study included (a) developing
  an in-depth understanding of the community ethnic culture; (b) developing mutual
  respect and trust with community members and study participants; (c) appreciating
  and praising community partners' knowledge, expertise, and experiences; (d) developing
  a sense of ownership by incorporating their needs, ideas, suggestions, and opinions
  and empowering study participants to make decisions concerning the study approach
  and wording; (e) soliciting participant feedback and clarification of study results
  and involving them in disseminating the study findings to their community; and (f)
  having fun with them and encouraging them to have fun. Â© The Author(s) 2012.
