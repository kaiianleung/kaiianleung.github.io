abstract: 'Context: Latinos have one of the highest prevalences of obesity in the
  U.S. Efforts to address U.S. Latino health have expanded to include obesity prevention
  and treatment initiatives. The objectives of this review were to (1) conduct a systematic
  review of obesity-related treatment interventions targeting U.S. Latino adults and
  (2) develop evidence-based recommendations to inform culturally relevant strategies
  for obesity treatment targeting U.S. Latino adults. Evidence Acquisition: Obesity
  treatment interventions, published between 1990 and 2010, were identified through
  a systematic search of electronic databases conducted between January 2010 and December
  2011. Details of the screening process and selection/exclusion criteria are reported
  in the Guide to Obesity Prevention in Latin America and the U.S. (GOL) parent study.
  Evidence Synthesis: Of the 325 studies identified in the GOL parent study, 105 met
  the inclusion criteria, and 22 involved obesity treatment interventions for Latinos
  and were included in the present review. The 22 studies were evaluated (between
  January 2010 and December 2011) for strength of study design and execution; effect
  sizes were also estimated for treatment effects on obesity-related outcomes. Interventions
  for physical activity or diet behavioral changes with strong or sufficient evidence
  included (1) community-based, culturally relevant, RCTs, and non-randomized controlled
  trials; (2) church-based interventions; and (3) promotora-led interventions. Conclusion(s):
  Most interventions targeted physical activity and/or diet behavioral modification
  in Latinas and were led by bicultural/bilingual professionals. Potential key intervention
  settings include community clinics/centers and churches. Although there was limited
  literature on obesity treatment interventions for U.S. Latinos, the review findings
  provide valuable insight to researchers and practitioners involved in obesity treatment
  for U.S. Latino adults. Â© 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.'
