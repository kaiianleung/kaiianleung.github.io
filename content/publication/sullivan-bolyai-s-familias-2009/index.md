abstract: This study was undertaken to improve the cultural and linguistic sensitivity
  of an established parent-mentor training curriculum for Latino parents of young
  children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The cultural sensitivity of curriculum
  components was determined by interviewing four Latino mothers raising five children
  (aged 7 to 12 years) with type 1 diabetes. The mothers recommended offering resources
  in English and Spanish, including access to bilingual taxi service, providing access
  to family diabetes education on child development and preparation of healthy traditional
  cultural foods, and training for babysitting children with diabetes. They also suggested
  offering after-school and weekend diabetes clinics to decrease interference with
  work and school activities. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
