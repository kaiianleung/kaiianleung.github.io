 abstract = {This study was undertaken to improve the cultural and linguistic sensitivity of an established parent-mentor training curriculum for Latino parents of young children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. The cultural sensitivity of curriculum components was determined by interviewing four Latino mothers raising five children (aged 7 to 12 years) with type 1 diabetes. The mothers recommended offering resources in English and Spanish, including access to bilingual taxi service, providing access to family diabetes education on child development and preparation of healthy traditional cultural foods, and training for babysitting children with diabetes. They also suggested offering after-school and weekend diabetes clinics to decrease interference with work and school activities. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
