 abstract = {A wealth of research has investigated the effects of bilingualism on cognition, especially on executive function. Developmental studies reveal different cognitive profiles between monolinguals and bilinguals in (audio-)visual attention tasks, which might stem from their attention allocation differences. Yet, whether such distinction exists in the auditory domain alone is unknown. In this study, we compared differences in auditory attention, measured by standardized tests, between monolingual and bilingual children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three electronic databases: OVID Medline, OVID PsycInfo, and EBSCO CINAHL. Empirical studies using standardized tests to assess auditory attention in monolingual and bilingual participants aged less than 18 years were included. Among the 20 studies identified, we performed a meta-analysis and found that test measure (accuracy vs. response times) was significantly related to differences in effect sizes whereas other factors (e.g., participant age, stimulus type) were not. Specifically, studies reporting accuracy observed a marginal bilingual advantage (g = 0.10), but those reporting response times indicated a small monolingual benefit (g = -0.34). Therefore, there was little difference between monolingual and bilingual children’s performance on standardized auditory attention tests. We also found that studies tend to include a wide variety of bilingual children but report limited language background information of the participants. This, unfortunately, limits the potential theoretical contributions of the reviewed studies. Recommendations to improve the quality of future research are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2019-06523).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
