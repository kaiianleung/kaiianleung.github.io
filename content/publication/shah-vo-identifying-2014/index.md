abstract: The Zuni Pueblo is home to an economically disadvantaged population, which
  faces a public health challenge from the interrelated epidemics of obesity, diabetes
  and kidney disease. Efforts to decrease the impact of these epidemics have been
  complicated by historical, economic and cultural barriers, which may limit healthcare
  utilization. The NIH supported Zuni Health Initiative (ZHI) conducted a study to
  identify barriers to healthcare in the Zuni Pueblo. Community health representatives
  (CHRs) led 14 one-hour focus group sessions at which a total of 112 people participated
  posed unique questions that took into account the Zuni culture to elicit information
  on perceived barriers to healthcare. Audiotapes were translated and transcribed
  by bilingual ZHI staff. We reduced the text to thematic categories, constructed
  a coding dictionary and inserted the text into NVivo 9 program. We identified nine
  themes emerged regarding the barriers experienced in receiving healthcare and adhering
  to medical advice. These included distance; transportation; embarrassment; relating
  to healthcare professionals; navigating the medical system; awareness of available
  resources; waiting times; adhering to medication; and incentives in health promotion.
  In conclusion the implementation of culturally appropriate community-based health
  promotion programs and preventive screening techniques will improve access to healthcare
  and diminish health disparities. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
