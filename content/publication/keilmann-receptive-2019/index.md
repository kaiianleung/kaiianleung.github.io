abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Many studies examining early bilingualism in migrant populations
  focus on the development of the first language. As language acquisition is closely
  related to the hearing development, there is a critical need to investigate language
  development in hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually who were fitted
  with cochlear implants and/or hearing aids. Therefore, this research project aimed
  to study the linguistic development of hearing-impaired children being raised with
  German as a second language who were provided with hearing aids or cochlear implants.
  Further, the language development of these children is compared with that of hearing-impaired
  children being raised in a monolingual environment and with normal-hearing children
  being raised bilingually., METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed data
  from 95 typically developing children with hearing loss (43 bilingual and 52 monolingual)
  aged 3;0 to 10;11 (years; months) on four language measures in German: receptive
  vocabulary, productive vocabulary, receptive grammar, productive grammar (sentence
  repetition). Additionally, 30 bilingual children with normal hearing were included
  in this study., RESULTS: 44 children were provided with hearing aids in both ears;
  34 used cochlear implants bilaterally and 17 were fitted bimodally. Statistical
  analysis showed that bilingual hearing-impaired children scored significantly poorer
  than monolingual hearing-impaired children., CONCLUSION: Hearing-impaired children
  being raised bilingually should have speech and language examinations on a regular
  basis. An examination of both languages would be desirable in order to be able to
  fully assess speech and language acquisition. Copyright Â© 2019. Published by Elsevier
