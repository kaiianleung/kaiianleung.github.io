abstract: The development of open information and communication space creates conditions
  for the spread of bilingualism as a leading trend in the language development of
  modern society. However, the disadvantage of this situation is the interference,
  which involuntarily occurs if you speak two or more languages. The problem of detecting
  indications of interference becomes especially relevant, which is explained by many
  reasons, among them vague language and translation training of the translator, which
  is what causes the indications of harmful interference in intercultural communication
  and translation. Clarifying the indications of interference as a communicative barrier
  due to the convergence of linguistic and cultural codes of the contacting languages
  ​​will ensure a successful process of intercultural communication and translation.
  It will promote the development of relevant, significant professional translation
  activities in translators. When learning a language, try to find similarities or
  differences in language structures to better explain errors in differences or master
  the material by comparing the similarities of language structures. In intercultural
  communication and translation, the main aim is to convey information to the reader
  or listener in the most natural way possible, using all known stylistic, grammatical,
  lexical, and grammatical means. This research was conducted based on the methods
  of observation, comparison, analysis, functional and descriptive methods. In order
  to solve this problem, the achievements of linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology,
  psycholinguistics, methods of teaching foreign languages were analyzed, as the study
  of the phenomenon of interference is based on them. The result is the formation
  of a linguistic personality, in particular, the bilingual personality of the translator
  in a dialogue that has the ability and skills to use the language in all its manifestations
  in different situations of intercultural communication; the ability to understand
  and assimilate someone else's way of life and behavior in order to break ingrained
  stereotypes; skills to expand the individual picture of the world by involving in
  the \"language picture of the world\" speakers of the studied language.Some prospects
  for further explorations in the development of a direct model of the bilingual personality
  of a translator in the context of intercultural dialogue and methods of linguistic
  and cultural formation competencies of translators in the aspect of mastering linguistic
  and cultural knowledge, skills and abilities in the studied areas of communication.
