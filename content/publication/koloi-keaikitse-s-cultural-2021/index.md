abstract: Calls have been made for researchers prospectively and continuously to engage
  study communities. If done, this typically occurs through a specific research study
  or collaboration. Rarely are community mores examined in-depth to understand implications
  for research ethics policy processes. We describe a qualitative study designed to
  understand local community values, beliefs, and practices that relate to research
  ethics in Botswana and explore how communities would want their interests represented.
  Through focus group discussions across two different selected ethnic communities
  and in-depth interviews with paramount chiefs, we highlight a range of community
  values and expectations that represent concrete behavioral representations of respect
  and trustworthiness. Communities are willing to engage in the process of enhancing
  research and research ethics policies and procedures. We invite future research
  and training that seek to connect local conceptualizations of substantive and procedural
  aspects of research ethics.
