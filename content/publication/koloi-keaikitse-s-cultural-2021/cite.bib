 abstract = {Calls have been made for researchers prospectively and continuously to engage study communities. If done, this typically occurs through a specific research study or collaboration. Rarely are community mores examined in-depth to understand implications for research ethics policy processes. We describe a qualitative study designed to understand local community values, beliefs, and practices that relate to research ethics in Botswana and explore how communities would want their interests represented. Through focus group discussions across two different selected ethnic communities and in-depth interviews with paramount chiefs, we highlight a range of community values and expectations that represent concrete behavioral representations of respect and trustworthiness. Communities are willing to engage in the process of enhancing research and research ethics policies and procedures. We invite future research and training that seek to connect local conceptualizations of substantive and procedural aspects of research ethics.},
