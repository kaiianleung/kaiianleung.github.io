abstract: "Partners in Health: The Breast and Cervical Health Cooperative is a New
  Orleans-based community health intervention program designed to increase the access
  of underserved multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual women to cervical and
  breast cancer health education and screening. This article describes innovative
  approaches used over the past 4 years to successfully link the services of a university
  cancer center to women in the community through a culturally sensitive outreach
  program. In addition to cancer screening, health referrals were made for many other
  diverse medical/social complications such as hypertension, obesity, and violence.
  The program initially targeted African American women but during the past year has
  successfully integrated Latinas. Key to the program's success was the collaboration
  of community lay health educators, community churches, advanced practice nurses,
  and public health programs. This article provides an overview of program strategies
  and outcomes and discusses multicultural and multilingual issues."
