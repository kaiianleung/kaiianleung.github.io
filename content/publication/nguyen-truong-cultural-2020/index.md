abstract: "Background: In Oregon in the United States' Pacific Northwest, Native Hawaiians/Pacific
  Islanders including Micronesian Islanders (MI) substantially grew by 68%; however,
  research is sparse. This is often due to data aggregation as Asian and Pacific Islanders
  and community members' reluctance and wariness to participate in research due to
  a history of unethical research in the Pacific. The MI community experienced miscarriages,
  stillbirths, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Organizational MI
  community leaders expressed a need to explore the voices of MI parent leaders (MIPLs).
  The purpose of the community-based participatory qualitative descriptive pilot study
  was to explore the perceptions and experiences of MIPLs with maternal and children's
  health, the school system, and the influence of culture. Methods: A trained MI community
  health worker recruited eight MIPLs from an urban area of the Pacific northwest
  in the United States. A group level assessment included illustrative storytelling
  and is a participant-driven qualitative method that guided data collection and analysis
  with real-time involvement with MIPL. The discussions lasted for 90 minutes. MIPL
  shared stories by writing and drawing pictures onto the flip chart papers, transcribed
  main points, and analyzed the data with researchers. Researchers recorded field
  notes of the interactions. Researchers debriefed with MIPL to assure trustworthiness
  and credibility of the findings. Findings: MIPL are Compact of Free Association
  citizens. Their age ranged from 26 to 42 years, have lived in the United States
  an average of 12.63 years, and most reported having less than $15,000 total household
  income before taxes. Four main themes were identified: MI cultural identity, English
  language and MI culture disharmony, zero or delayed prenatal care, and uncertainty
  for the future of MI children who have disabilities or developmentally delayed as
  they progress through the school system. Conclusion:  Health care providers including
  nurses and school officials need to have a culturally specific understanding of
  the MI community and must consider their needs, culture, and language barriers.
