abstract: This paper explores a partnership between an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges
  and Universities) and a community to understand trauma given the high rates of reported
  violence among youth locally. The accumulative stress of living in high-stress,
  high-poverty environments coupled with the normative developmental tasks of adolescence
  is thought to place these youths at risk for negative mental and physical outcomes
  (Murry et al., 2011). The current research uses a community-based participatory
  research (CBPR) approach and developmental lens to better understand environmental
  stressors and subsequent trauma among Black youth. Specifically, the paper describes
  the recruitment, engagement, and equitable partnership between a youth advisory
  board (YAB), university research team, and community agencies advisory board (CAB).
  The current work is part of a larger research study designed to explore environmental
  stressors, coping, and social supports for Black youth residing in low-resource
  urban communities. The broad objective of the research is to develop a trauma-informed
  community intervention to improve adolescent mental health. The initial phase of
  this university-community research, which entails the YAB, CAB, and university discussion
  groups, is outlined in this paper. Community engagement and trust are key factors
  described in the literature when collaborating with communities of color. These
  themes were reiterated by research partners in this study. The research team created
  coding terms to identify themes from YAB and CAB transcript data, respectively.
  YAB themes regarding stressors centered around financial strain, anger, and loss/violence.
  CAB themes regarding adolescent mental health and resources centered around trauma,
  trust, and sustainability. Initial steps to utilize the themes identified thus far
  are described. The unique advantages of an HBCU and CBPR to address mental health
  disparities in ethnic minority communities are also highlighted.Copyright Â© 2020
