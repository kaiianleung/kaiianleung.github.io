abstract: Background. Little is known about cancer pain in Chinese Americans. The
  objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of pain in this population.
  This information is needed to identify and address unmet clinical needs for culturally
  relevant interventions targeting pain and its consequences. Methods. A consecutive
  sample of underserved ethnic Chinese patients in a large community-based oncology
  practice was screened for persistent or frequent pain. Those patients with pain
  completed translated instruments assessing demographics, linguistic acculturation,
  disease-related characteristics, and pain-related characteristics. Results. Of 312
  patients screened, 178 (57.1%) reported frequent or persistent pain, 175 were eligible,
  and 170 participated. Most participants (85.9%) were born in China and 84.7% overall
  spoke Cantonese only. The most common cancers were gastrointestinal (28.2%), lung
  (21.8%), breast (20.6%), head and neck (12.9%), and genitourinary (4.7%); 43.5%
  had metastatic disease. The mean worst pain severity on a 0-10 numeric scale was
  4.7 (standard deviation, 2.4), with 28.2% of patients rating their worst pain attextgreater7
  of 10. Although 37.6% used opioids and 47.1% used nonopioids, 45.8% reported \"little\"
  or \"no\" pain relief from medications. Complementary or alternative medicine therapies
  for cancer pain were used by 35.8%. In multiple regression analyses, worst pain
  was positively associated with acculturation to the English language and opioid
  therapy, and pain-related distress was positively associated with opioid therapy.
  Conclusion. Pain is prevalent among community dwelling, ethnic Chinese American
  cancer patients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and investigate
  the finding that higher linguistic acculturation is associated with reports of more
  intense pain.
