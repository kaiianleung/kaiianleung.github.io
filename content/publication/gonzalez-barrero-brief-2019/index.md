abstract: We examined the lexical and grammatical skills of monolingual and bilingual
  school-age children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Thirteen monolingual and
  thirteen bilingual children with ASD without intellectual disability, were compared
  on standardized measures of vocabulary and morphology. Findings revealed that bilingual
  children performed in the average monolingual range on a standardized receptive
  vocabulary test and slightly below the average range on a standardized morphological
  task in their dominant language. Prior work indicates that bilingual exposure is
  not detrimental for early language development in children with autism. The current
  findings suggest that at school age, bilinguals with ASD show similar language development
  patterns as those described in the literature on typically-developing bilinguals.
