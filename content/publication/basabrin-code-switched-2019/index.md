abstract: This paper investigates the myth of children’s monolingual brain by conducting
  a case study of a two-year-old Saudi-American girl, who is in the two-word stage
  of vocalization, by focusing on a certain speech act, viz., “greeting” and demonstrating
  how it is heavily code-switched into Arabic/English language(s) with regard to the
  context of the speech and the greeter/receiver of the greeting identity. The subject
  has been raised in an English-speaking country milieu (United States of America),
  while she has been used to speaking Arabic at home. In this regard, the paper highlights
  the aim of the encoded usage of code-switching utterances in term of addressing
  the monolingual brain hypothesis. This qualitative study is based on open observations
  of two continues months of a toddler as the participant of this study aiming at
  exploring whether children’s greeting differ from those of adults and whether this
  greeting differs between two languages with regard to monolingual brain hypotheses.
  So far, the study concluded that greeting has never been mixed upon context, though
  utterances are code-switched. Moreover, the greeting process is comprehended and
  acquired within the language context as a pragmatic speech act regarding greeter’s
  identity, context, and gender. Findings of this study significantly support the
  cognitive approach in term of greeting via using a high frequent greeting word among
  the American culture. As would cognitive linguists suggest, greeting speech act
  response varies regarding how greeters of each community greet the subject, but
  not how they greet each other’s in a community. Therefore, surprisingly the two-year-old
  subject perceptually recognizes the fact of receiving two different languages regardless
  to the monolingual hypothesis.
