abstract: 'Acculturation is a difficult process for minority older adults for a variety
  of reasons, including access and exposure to mainstream culture, competing ethnic
  identities, and linguistic ability and preference. There is a paucity of research
  regarding overall level of acculturation for Chinese older adults in the United
  States. This study aimed to provide an overall estimate of level of acculturation
  of Chinese older adults in the United States and to examine correlations between
  sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health measures, and level of acculturation.
  Data were collected through the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE)
  study. This community-based participatory research study surveyed 3,159 Chinese
  older adults aged 60 and older. The PINE Study Acculturation Scale was used to assess
  level of acculturation in three dimensions: language preference, media use, and
  ethnic social relations. Mean acculturation level for all items was 15.3 +/- 5.1,
  indicating low levels of acculturation. Older age, more offspring, lower income,
  fewer years living in the United States, lower overall health status, and lower
  quality of life were associated with lower levels of acculturation. Level of acculturation
  was low in Chinese older adults, and certain subsets of the population were more
  likely to have a lower level of acculturation. Future research should investigate
  causality and effects of level of acculturation.© 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal
