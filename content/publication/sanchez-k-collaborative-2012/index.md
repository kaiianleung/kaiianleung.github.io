abstract: "Objective: This study sought to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative
  care model with a predominantly Hispanic, low-income population in a primary care
  setting and (2) examine depression outcomes with a subpopulation of preferentially
  Spanish-speaking patients compared with non-Hispanic white participants. Method(s):
  The data were collected from September 2006 through September 2009 at the study
  site, the People's Community Clinic, Austin, Texas. Data collection was part of
  an evaluation of the Integrated Behavioral Health program, a collaborative care
  model of identifying and treating mild-to-moderate mental disorders in adults in
  a primary care setting. A bilingual care manager provided supportive counseling
  and patient education and systematically tracked patient progress in a patient registry.
  A consulting psychiatrist evaluated patients with diagnostic or treatment concerns.
  The study retrospectively examined changes in depression scores among 269 subjects
  as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the primary outcome measure.
  The PHQ-9 is a self-report of frequency of symptoms for each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria
  for depression. Logistic regression models compared race/ethnicity and language
  group combinations on their odds of achieving clinically meaningful depression improvement
  when background characteristics were controlled for. Result(s): Spanish-speaking
  Hispanic patients had significantly greater odds of achieving a clinically meaningful
  improvement in depression at 3-month follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45, P =.013)
  compared to non-Hispanic whites. The finding for greater improvement in the Spanish-speaking
  population remained after controlling for age, sex, medical comorbidities, prior
  treatment, and baseline depression scores. Conclusion(s): The results suggest a
  model of care that is effective for a population at great risk for marginal mental
  health care, non-English-speaking Hispanics. Attention to patient preferences in
  primary care is essential to improve quality of depression treatment and may improve
  outcomes. In light of previous research that demonstrates insufficient evidence-based
  guidelines for patients with limited English proficiency and evidence that evaluation
  of patients in their nonprimary language or through an interpreter can lead to inaccurate
  mental health assessments, this study suggests an opportunity to improve the quality
  of mental health care for non-English-speaking Hispanics in the United States. Â©
