abstract: 'Background: Memory for familiar music is retained in by people with dementia
  despite deteriorations in other areas of functioning and music-based interventions
  have achieved some success in elevating mood, decreasing BPSD and increasing engagement.
  Yet few studies of group singing to music have been reported in this population.
  Purpose(s): This presentation provides an overview of the literature on singing-based
  interventions for people with dementia. It also reports on a recent pre and post
  repeated measures pilot study of the effect of choir participation on mood, engagement,
  BPSD and quality of life in participants from culturally and linguistically diverse
  backgrounds attending day respite but reported as difficult to engage in most activities.
  Method(s): Participants (n = 7, mean age = 78, 5 male, 1 female, 3 Greek and 3 Italian
  first generation bilingual immigrants) attended 8 weekly sessions of guitar-accompanied
  choir singing in English, Italian and Greek facilitated by a trained music therapist
  with dementia expertise. Measures (baseline, mid, immediate post and 4 weeks post)
  included cognitive status (baseline, 4 weeks post only), BPSD, social interaction,
  engagement mood/depression, sleep and quality of life. Carer measures were BPSD
  burden, sleep and mood. All participants were videotaped in a randomised schedule
  in each session for coding by two trained staff using Noldus Observer XT. Result(s):
  Statistically significant improvements in mood, BPSD engagement and QoL from Baseline
  were found, retained one-month post intervention for mood and QoL. All participants
  were engaged more than 98% of the time they were singing, but showed greater positive
  affect during repetitive choruses or in songs sung in their own first language.
  Findings suggest a larger rigorous trial is warranted.'
