abstract: 'PURPOSE: Given that children with Down syndrome (DS) have language learning
  difficulties, concerns have been raised about the capacity of these children to
  acquire two (or more) languages. This research examines the language profiles of
  bilingual children with DS and typically developing (TD) children in comparison
  to monolinguals, with a view towards identifying the factors associated with language
  abilities within these populations., METHOD: Four groups of children were recruited:
  Welsh-English bilinguals with DS (n=10), English monolinguals with DS (n=10), TD
  Welsh-English bilinguals (n=10) and TD English monolinguals (n=10). Children were
  individually matched on nonverbal cognitive ability (NVCA) to each child in the
  bilingual DS group and the four groups were matched on socioeconomic status and
  gender. Bilinguals were matched on current and lifetime exposure to Welsh and age
  of first exposure to their L2. Within DS and TD groups, chronological age was statistically
  controlled for. Language abilities were assessed via standardised assessments and
  specially designed tasks. Bilinguals were assessed in both of their languages.,
  RESULTS: Results show no effect of language status on measures of expressive and
  receptive language abilities or phonological awareness. Language impairments were
  evident for both DS groups, particularly for expressive morphosyntax. Welsh receptive
  vocabulary scores of the bilinguals with DS were comparable to the TD bilinguals.
  Working memory, phonological awareness and chronological age were the strongest
  predictors of receptive language outcomes in both DS groups, explaining 90% of the
  variability., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we report no adverse outcomes on language
  development for bilinguals with DS. To our knowledge, this is the first group study
  of bilingualism in children with DS within the UK. Findings align with and add to
  the growing body of literature that reports that bilingualism does not negatively
  impact the language development of children with developmental disabilities. Clinical
  and educational implications are discussed. Copyright Â© 2021. Published by Elsevier
