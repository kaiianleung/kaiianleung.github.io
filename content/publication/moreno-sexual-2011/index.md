abstract: The authors examined sexual factors for HIV risk in 1,003 women of Puerto
  Rican heritage who attended a community-based NewYork City hospital clinic. Participants
  ' ages ranged from 18 to 73 years. Half were born in the continental United States,
  and half were born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. All were sexually active
  within the past 90 days with a male partner. The authors compared sociodemographic
  characteristics, experience of intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV sexual risk
  factors (number of partners, history of sexually transmitted infections [STIs],condom
  use, and so on). Multiple regression analyses considering sociodemographic characteristics
  were a predictor for IPV and sexual risk behaviors. The authors found differences
  in sexual risk behaviors by place of birth (continental United States versus Commonwealth
  of Puerto Rico) and language chosen for the interview (Spanish or English). Puerto
  Rican women reported fewer sexual partners and STIs. Mainland-born and English-preference
  women reported more IPV, risky partners, and condom use. Birth in the continental
  United States and preference for English appear to be indicators of greater risk
  for IPV, risky sexual practices, and risky partners. HIV prevention intervention
  strategies for Puerto Rican women must address differences in heterosexual risk
  according to language and place of birth.
