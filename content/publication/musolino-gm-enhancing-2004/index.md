abstract: "Background and Purpose. A curriculum-based service-learning (SL) project
  provided: (1) integration of SL principles; (2) a description of a viable SL model;
  and (3) a method to increase awareness of the profession of physical therapy for
  a diverse population of school-age students, promoting active participation and
  enhancing community linkages within a mentor/protege framework. Method/Model Description
  and Evaluation. SL is experiential education with community service, connecting
  theory and real-life practice with reflection opportunities. Through mentor/protege
  relationships, students were mentored by health care professionals, investigated
  theoretical constructs of mentoring and pluralism, and explored viable communities
  for diversity enhancement projects. Students proposed sites, then winnowed selections,
  identified resources, and developed curricular plans for SL. In concert with faculty
  and administrative staffs, mentoring plans were set in motion for two communities:
  (1) a hands-on museum attracting diverse K-6 students from six counties, including
  those who are deaf or hard of hearing and migrant farm workers' children of Hispanic
  descent and (2) an after-school program for African American children from low-income
  families. Evaluative data collected determined the effectiveness of mentoring interventions
  and experiences aligned with objectives. Illustrating the intended SL purposes,
  physical therapist (PT) students concluded with in-class presentations utilizing
  videotape vignettes, photographs, administrative evaluations, and self-assessments
  and team assessments. The implemented projects included age-appropriate interactive
  learning exhibits and skits, emphasizing PT roles and responsibilities. Outcomes.
  Artifacts and evaluations supported the nurturing potential of SL through these
  community-based mentor/protege encounters. Clearly achieving course objectives and
  community needs, PT students promoted the profession to a diverse student population
  and creative leadership roles were realized beyond the traditional classroom/clinic.
  Students were recognized with the National Student Assembly 'Student Outreach for
  Cultural Diversity Awareness' Award. Discussion and Conclusion. Through this SL
  model, additional professional implications were realized: (1) the unexpected outcomes
  of students as stewards and leaders; (2) an avenue to serve as mentors for at-risk
  school-age children, who otherwise might not have gained first-hand exposure and
  insight into the profession; (3) a positive and meaningful experience to allow students
  to provide community service while fulfilling university service outcomes; and (4)
  enhanced exposure to the profession beyond the classroom and clinical walls, nurturing
  the spirit of service. PT students assumed ownership of these projects bridging
  classroom theories and readings with real-life application, with faculty in the
  role of facilitators of the learning experience."
