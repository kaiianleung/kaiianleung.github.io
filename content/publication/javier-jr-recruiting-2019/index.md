abstract: 'Filipinos, the second largest Asian subgroup in the U.S., experience significant
  youth behavioral health disparities but remain under-represented in health research.
  We describe lessons learned from using the Matching Model of Recruitment to recruit
  215 Filipinos to participate in a large, randomized controlled trial of a culturally
  tailored video aimed at increasing enrollment in the Incredible Years Parent Program.
  We recruited participants from schools, churches, clinics, community events, and
  other community-based locations. Facilitators of participation included: partnership
  with local community groups, conducting research in familiar settings, building
  on existing social networks, and matching perspectives of community members and
  researchers. Findings suggest recruitment success occurs when there is a match between
  goals of Filipino parents, grandparents and the research community. Understanding
  the perspectives of ethnic minority communities and effectively communicating goals
  of research studies are critical to successful recruitment of hard-to-reach immigrant
  populations in randomized controlled trials.'
