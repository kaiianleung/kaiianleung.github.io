abstract: 'AIM: Clinical trials play a critical role in advancing cancer care, but
  international research shows that few cancer patients, particularly culturally and
  linguistically diverse (CALD) patients, participate in trials. This limits generalizability
  of trial results and increases health disparities. This study aimed to establish
  rates and correlates of trial participation among CALD patients in South Western
  Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD), a highly culturally diverse area., METHODS:
  Data from all cancer patients diagnosed and/or treated in SWSLHD from January 2006
  to July 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome was trial enrolment
  among patients born in non-English speaking countries (CALD) versus English speaking
  countries (non-CALD). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated CALD status as
  a predictor of trial participation. Moderators of trial participation by the different
  CALD groups, namely those whose preferred language was English (CALD-PLE) or was
  not English (CALD-PLNE), were examined by testing interactions between CALD status
  and other demographic and clinical variables., RESULTS: A total of 19 453 patients
  were analyzed (54.9% non-CALD, 16.5% CALD-PLE, 18.5% CALD-PLNE). Overall, 7.4% of
  patients were enrolled in a trial. Trial participation was significantly lower in
  CALD patients than non-CALD patients (5.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.80; 95%
  confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.91; P = 0.001). CALD-PLNE patients were less likely
  to participate in trials than non-CALD (OR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36-0.56; P textless
  0.0001) and CALD-PLE patients (OR = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.67-0.41; P textless 0.0001).,
  CONCLUSIONS: Limited English proficiency seems particularly unfavorable to trial
  participation. Development and evaluation of strategies to overcome language barriers
  (e.g. simplified and translated multimedia participant information materials) is
  needed. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.'
