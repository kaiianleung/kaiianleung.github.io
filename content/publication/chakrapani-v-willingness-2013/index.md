abstract: 'Background: India, with 2.4 million people living with HIV and 120,000
  annual HIV-incident infections, has the highest disease burden of HIV in Asia, and
  a concentrated epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). Yet out of textgreater235
  HIV vaccine trials conducted globally, two phase-I trials were completed in India.
  Investigations of willingness to participate (WTP) in HIV vaccine trials have focused
  predominantly on individual-level determinants and high-income countries. We explored
  multi-level factors associated with WTP among MSM in India. Method(s): We conducted
  a qualitative investigation using a community- based approach; community-based organizations
  (CBOs) in Chennai and Mumbai collaborated in study design, instrument development,
  data collection and interpretation. Twelve focus groups (n=68) with low-socioeconomic
  MSM and 14 key informant interviews with MSM community leaders/service providers
  were recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Two bilingual investigators
  conducted thematic analysis using line-by-line, axial and focused coding and a constant
  comparative method, with member-checking by community representatives. Results :
  Factors associated with WTP were evidenced across the social ecology of MSM - social-structural:
  poverty, HIV-, sexual- and gender non-conformity stigma, institutionalized discrimination;
  community-level: endorsement by MSM community leaders/organizations, fear of in-group
  discrimination; interpersonal: anticipated family discord, partner rejection, financially-dependent
  family members, sexual orientation disclosure; and individual-level: HIV vaccine
  trial knowledge/ misconceptions, safety concerns, altruism and preventive misconception.
  Conclusion(s): Decision-making about WTP was embedded in social-structural, community
  and familial spheres of influence. By focusing on individual-level determinants
  of WTP we risk misunderstanding and misconceptualizing barriers and motivators to
  participation, failing to mitigate ethical challenges and may thereby limit the
  effectiveness of interventions designed to support recruitment and retention in
  biomedical HIV prevention trials. Combatting stigma and discrimination against MSM
  and people living with HIV, supporting research literacy among low-socioeconomic
  communities and capacity-building for MSM CBOs may advance meaningful engagement
  of MSM in India in HIV vaccine trials.'
