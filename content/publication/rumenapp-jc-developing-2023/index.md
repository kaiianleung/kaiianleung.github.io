abstract: "Objective: In response to the question 'how can teachers develop health
  literacy events that leverage students' cultural and linguistic resources', this
  study highlights how two teachers developed a culturally and linguistically responsive
  curriculum that sought to promote health literacy. Design(s): The study details
  findings from a larger partnership between an urban university and a bilingual urban
  school in the USA. Researchers and teachers conducted a year-long project oriented
  towards co-designing a curriculum that integrated students' cultural and linguistic
  repertoires with health literacy. Over one academic year, teachers planned, implemented,
  studied and modified curricular units that drew on students' cultural and linguistic
  resources related to health. Setting(s): The study focuses on two Spanish-English
  bilingual teachers working in a third-grade (8-9 year olds) dual-language classroom
  in a multilingual urban community in the midwestern USA. Method(s): Data collected
  included classroom conversations, teacher-researcher and university researcher conversations,
  classroom work and teacher-derived analytic documents. Data were coded and analysed
  to understand how teachers made sense of what happened within specific health literacy
  events to develop a single descriptive case study. Result(s): Three events are focused
  on demonstrating how teachers developed health literacy by building on students'
  pre-existing cultural and linguistic resources. Teachers moved from using teacher-centred
  forms of nutrition education to using student-developed health content that articulated
  with health concerns in the community. Conclusion(s): Using a funds of knowledge
  approach to integrating health literacy into the curriculum, teachers helped students
  draw on cultural and linguistic resources, building self-confidence, and developing
  an interest in gathering evidence and presenting health-related findings.Copyright
