abstract: 'This was a model of community engagement for a Hispanic population in East
  Harlem, New York City to assess health care decision-making processes, with a focus
  on end-of-life decisions, among older men and women. The design involved two senior
  center-based semi-structured focus groups conducted in Spanish and English followed
  by a series of bilingual skills-building workshops focusing on situational decision-making.
  All program aspects were conducted between April and June of 2013. The themes for
  the workshops included: \"Getting the most from your pharmacist encounter;\" \"How
  to prepare for your primary care visit;\" and \"I am getting discharged from the
  hospital: what do I do?\" For the two focus groups, 21 community members participated,
  each of whom self-identified as Hispanic or Latina/o. Ten common themes emerged
  from a two-stage/two coder, grounded theory-based qualitative analysis and included:
  Where Community Members Receive Care; General Challenges, Cultural Challenges, and
  Benefits of Health Care in New York City/East Harlem; Key Facilitators in Health
  Care Decision Making; Key Facilitators in End-of-Life Decision Making; and Perceptions
  of Health Care Disparity. Themes and their subcategories, discussed herein, may
  offer guidance for area health providers and health care delivery entities. This
  project served as formative, qualitative data collection for a larger scale forthcoming
  community assessment while offering community benefit related to health decision-making,
  especially end-of-life decision making, in the context of a rapidly changing urban
  American health care delivery landscape. Application of this synergistic community
  benefit and data collection model is recommended for similar and other communities
  in the U.S. and other countries.'
