abstract: "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for Latinos
  living in the United States. This population is generally unaware of important lifestyle
  or behavioral changes that can prevent CVD. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood
  Institute (NHLBI) designed and implemented Salud para su Corazon (Health for Your
  Heart), a culturally appropriate, community- based, theory-driven intervention model.
  NHLBI's goals were: (1) to design an intervention model appropriate to Latino populations;
  (2) to pilot test the model in a specific community with the objectives of increasing
  awareness about heart disease, raising knowledge about CVD prevention, and promoting
  heart-healthy lifestyles; and (3) to disseminate the model and the materials developed
  to other communities with similar needs. An agency-community partnership, under
  the leadership of the Community Alliance for Heart Health, guided all stages of
  the community intervention project. The multimedia bilingual community intervention
  included television telenovela format public service announcements (PSAs), radio
  programs, brochures, recipe booklets, charlas, a promotores training manual, and
  motivational videos. An evaluation survey assessed the impact of the intervention.
  A pre-post intervention survey was conducted with more than 300 participants, and
  results showed that the respondents were substantially more aware of risk factors
  for CVD, and had greatly increased their knowledge of ways to prevent heart disease.
  Dissemination efforts have resulted in numerous requests by health organizations,
  universities, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for educational materials
  and communication strategies produced by Salud para su Corazon. In addition, Univision,
  the largest Spanish-language broadcast television network, is airing the initiative's
  PSAs. Also, training seminars for promotores are being conducted in different regions
  of the United States, and several locations are planning to replicate this study."
