abstract: "California has a recently documented problem of trans-national environmental
  lead exposures in imported foods from Mexico but there is limited health information
  available in immigrant communities about this problem. This report highlights collaborative
  work with English as a Second Language (ESL) learners to critically review research
  data on lead exposures and reframe prevention messages about lead contamination
  of imported foods. These messages are now integrated into ESL curricula for dissemination
  to Spanish-speaking populations that are disproportionately affected by lead poisoning.
  This 'learners as interpreters' approach is a participatory method that can be applied
  across a wide range of public health activities. ESL learners emerged as ideal partners
  in developing curriculum for lead poisoning prevention for several reasons: the
  parents expressed strong interest in lead poisoning prevention, several have children
  under age 6 when lead screenings are recommended, and many have emigrated from regions
  in Mexico where lead hazards were identified."
