abstract: The World Health Organization recommends that treatment for psychosis begin
  within 3 months of symptom onset. However, dozens of studies worldwide have observed
  an average delay of 2 years between appearance of psychotic symptoms and treatment
  initiation. Two meta-analyses and the U.S. Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia
  Episode-Early Treatment Program have established that duration of untreated psychosis
  (DUP)-the time from psychosis onset to treatment initiation-is correlated with poor
  clinical and functional outcomes. Early psychosis treatment programs are increasingly
  available in the U.S., but many in need are missing this critical opportunity. Accordingly,
  the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launched a research program to identify
  sources of early psychosis treatment delay and test practical and innovative strategies
  for reducing DUP in the U.S. This symposium features findings from a selection of
  these studies. Steven Lopez will report on the impact of a community-based, multi-level,
  bilingual psychosis communication campaign for U.S. Latinos on help seeking, DUP
  and treatment continuation. Vinod Srihari will report findings from the trial of
  Mindmap-a populationbased, multi-element, early psychosis detection campaign-on
  help seeking and DUP. Cameron Carter will present results from his trial assessing
  whether adding a novel, technology-enhanced early psychosis screening tool to standard
  provider education for early psychosis increases early psychosis identification
  and reduces DUP. Leslie Marino will present findings on a comprehensive set of DUP
  predictors for nearly 800 individuals enrolled in early psychosis treatment programs.
  Susan Azrin will discuss these findings and implications for developing practical
  DUP reduction strategies.
