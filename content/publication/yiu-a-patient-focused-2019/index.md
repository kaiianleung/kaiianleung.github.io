abstract: "The aim of this review was to identify patient-focused interventions that
  have been trialed to support vulnerable patient populations taking oral anticoagulants
  (warfarin and the direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) such as older persons
  (65 years and over), those with limited health literacy, and those from culturally
  and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. This review also aimed to report
  on the effects of these interventions on outcomes relevant to the use of anticoagulant
  therapy. Original articles published between 1 January 1995 and 30 June 2017 were
  identified using several electronic databases such as Medline, Ovid, Embase, Scopus,
  Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The following terms were used for the three-tiered
  search: Tier 1, elderly, aged, older adult, geriatrics; Tier 2, health literacy,
  literacy, low health literacy, low English proficiency, patient literacy; and Tier
  3, ethnicity, ethnic, ethnic groups, CALD, culturally and linguistically diverse,
  NESB, non-English speaking background, race, racial groups, religion, religious
  groups, and minority groups. The terms for each tier were combined with the following
  terms: anticoagulants, anticoagulation, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
  DOACS, new oral anticoagulants, novel oral anticoagulants, patient care, patient
  knowledge, comprehension, patient education, patient participation, and communication.
  A total of 41 studies were identified. Most of the interventions identified included
  older persons taking warfarin who were monitored using the international normalized
  ratio (INR) and who received patient education. Many interventions reported a significant
  positive impact on patients' knowledge, reduction in the number of adverse events
  caused by hemorrhage, and better INR control. More research on patient-focused interventions
  is needed that includes patients with limited health literacy, those from CALD backgrounds,
  and family members and caregivers of patients taking oral anticoagulants.Copyright
