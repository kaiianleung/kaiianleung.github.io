 abstract = {TOPIC: Education, Research, and Quality Improvement TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: To describe the development, implementation, and learner engagement in a longitudinal international remote critical care continuing medical education program in China. METHOD(S): Based on the Mayo Clinic Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute and Illness and iNjury (CERTAIN) program, we designed and delivered a longitudinal 40-week remote coaching program for a community-based teaching hospital in Shandong Province, China. Based on a mixed-methods needs assessment that included learner feedback using an exploratory sequential design and ICU process and outcomes data, we developed a curriculum that included asynchronous, online learning modules with multiple language captions and weekly remote education sessions using a blend of didactic presentations on common critical care syndromes, virtual simulation, journal club, and case-based discussions. Faculty included a diverse group of critical care experts and bilingual facilitators. The program also included clinical research and quality improvement workshops to facilitate implementation of key concepts identified during these activities. Participants completed a survey using a 5 point anchored Likert scale after each educational activity to provide feedback and guide course improvement. RESULT(S): Twenty-two Chinese clinicians (18 physicians, 4 nurses) enrolled in this CERTAIN longitudinal program. Learners completed a total of 163 hours (mean 7.4 hr/learner) asynchronous online learning, and to date have completed 23 weekly education sessions (total 28 hours, including an extended virtual simulation experience). Survey response rate was 56%. Learners reported a high rate of overall satisfaction with the course (112, 61% Excellent; 55 (30%) Very Good) and specific topic discussions (110,60% Excellent; 57, 31% Very Good), with steady improvement over time. Perceived practice relevance was also high (110, 59% Excellent; 55,30% Very Good), and this effort has informed ongoing local performance improvement initiatives. CONCLUSION(S): Remote delivery of longitudinal critical care continuing education program in China using asynchronous learning, case-based discussion, and virtual simulation is feasible, associated with a high rate of learner satisfaction, and increases engagement in quality improvement initiatives. This innovative global education initiative offers an important potential solution to strengthen critical care services in remote, resource-limited settings at low cost, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The World Health Organization has identified remote education programs as a priority to strengthen international critical care services and better meet growing global clinical demand. The best method to effectively deliver continuing medical education to international healthcare providers with unique cultural, organizational, and practice backgrounds is not well defined.
