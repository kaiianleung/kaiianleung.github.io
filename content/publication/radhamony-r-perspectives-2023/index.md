abstract: "WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: Immigrant, refugee and asylum seeker
  populations worldwide are at high risk of mental health issues National mental health
  policies call for recognising Australian society's multicultural characteristics
  to ensure adequate mental health services to CALD communities Several barriers exist
  for people from CALD communities in Victoria to access and utilise mental health
  services Improving mental health professionals' knowledge of mental health service
  provision and cultural responsiveness can enhance CALD community access to services.
  WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We analysed the perspectives of
  people from CALD communities in Victoria regarding their needs and experiences with
  mental health services. Participants reported diverse perceptions and understanding
  of mental health issues and services Various challenges were identified regarding
  health service utilisation for the CALD community in Victoria, including language
  barriers, stigma towards mental health issues, mental health illiteracy, distrust
  and lack of familiarity with mainstream mental health services. These challenges
  were acknowledged by community members even after a long residence in Australia
  The data generated on the beliefs about mental health issues and consequent help-seeking
  behaviours highlight the importance of culturally sensitive targeted prevention
  and early intervention strategies and ongoing commitment to building mental health
  literacy in the wider community WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The information
  from the study can be adapted for quality improvement and culturally responsive
  practices The strategies for effective service delivery drawn by this paper can
  be a comprehensive resource tool for mental health professionals, organisations
  and policymakers The findings imply that CALD mental health service users and their
  families will likely benefit from improved service assessment and quality of mental
  health care and equity when MHNs undertake cultural competence training and bring
  that into their practice. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Victoria is one of the most multicultural
  states in Australia. Many CALD communities in Victoria may have encountered complicated
  migration journeys and complex life stressors during their initial settlement, leading
  to adverse mental health concerns. This diversity necessitates public policy settings
  to ensure equity and access in health services planning and delivery. While the
  MH policies and services take cultural diversity into account, there needs to be
  more implementation of those components of MH policies that relate to the particular
  needs of various CALD communities in Victoria. Even though mental health services
  prevent and address mental health issues, many barriers can impair CALD community
  access and utilisation of mental health services. Furthermore, the recent Royal
  Commission inquiry into the Victorian Mental Health system drives a renewed policy
  imperative to ensure meaningful engagement and cultural safety of all people accessing
  and utilising mental health services (Department of Health, 2023). AIM: This study
  focused on the perspectives of people from CALD communities in Victoria regarding
  their mental health service needs, understandings of and experiences with mental
  health services to prepare an education package for mental health nurses as part
  of a larger multi-method research project. METHOD(S): A qualitative descriptive
  design was used to collect and analyse the perspectives of 21 participants in Victoria,
  using telephone interviews, followed by thematic analysis. RESULT(S): The themes
  and sub-themes identified were: Settling issues; Perceptions of understanding of
  mental health issues (help-seeking attitudes toward mental health issues; the need
  for CALD community education); perceived barriers to accessing and utilising mental
  health services in Victoria (socio-cultural and language barriers; stigma, labelling
  and discrimination; knowledge and experience of accessing health facilities); experience
  with mental health services and professionals. DISCUSSION: Community participation,
  mental health professional education and robust research regarding the mental health
  needs of CALD people are some of the recommended strategies to improve access and
  utilisation of mental health services in Victoria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The
  current study can contribute to the existing knowledge, understanding, practice
  and quality improvement as it vividly portrays the issues of various CALD communities
  in Victoria. The findings of this study imply that CALD MH service users and their
  families are likely to benefit in terms of improved service assessment and quality
  of MH care and equity when MHNs undertake CC training and bring that into their
  practice.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors. Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health
