abstract: ABSTRACT Research on second language learning by children with DLD has mainly
  focused on naturalistic L2 acquisition with plenty of exposure. Very little is known
  about how children with DLD learn foreign languages in classroom settings with limited
  input. This study addresses this gap and targets English as a foreign language (EFL)
  learning by Russian-speaking children with DLD. We ask whether learners with DLD
  benefit from a later onset of EFL instruction because older children are more cognitively
  mature and have more developed L1 skills. The second aim of this study is to determine
  whether EFL learners with DLD benefit from positive L1 transfer in vocabulary learning.
  We administered a receptive vocabulary test to younger (Grade 6, n = 18) and older
  (Grade 10, n = 15) children with DLD matched on the amount of prior EFL instruction.
  The younger group started EFL instruction in Grade 2 and the older group in Grade
  6. The performance of the two groups was compared after four and a half years of
  English lessons. Half of the words in the test were English-Russian cognates and
  half were noncognates. Contra to our hypothesis, the results showed no difference
  between younger and older children. Both groups equally benefitted from cognate
  vocabulary suggesting that positive cross-language transfer is available to children
  with DLD, irrespective of their age and onset of EFL instruction. (PsycInfo Database
