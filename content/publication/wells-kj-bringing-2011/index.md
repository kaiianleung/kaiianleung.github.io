abstract: "Introduction: Biospecimen donation and banking from diverse populations
  are critical for translational cancer research. Yet, little is known about community
  members' perceptions about biospecimen donation and banking. The objectives of this
  study are to develop instruments to examine perceptions of biospecimen donation
  and banking and evaluate the efficacy of biobanking educational materials. Method(s):
  Guided by a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, the study consists
  of two phases. In phase I, an instrument named Biobanking Attitudes and Knowledge
  Survey (BANKS) was developed in collaboration with the Tampa Bay Community Cancer
  Network (TBCCN) Biobanking Community Advisory Board to assess participants' knowledge
  about and attitudes towards biospecimen collection, intention to donate biospecimens
  to a biobank, as well as self-efficacy regarding biospecimen donation. BANKS development
  and validation consists of iterative processes, including content analysis of 12
  focus groups (n=95) for item generation; cognitive interviews (n=12 community members)
  to assess item comprehension and language appropriateness; content validity analyses
  with biobanking experts (n=5) to evaluate item relevancy to the constructs of interest
  (Knowledge, Attitudes and Self-efficacy); pilot-testing with community members;
  and instrument translation into Spanish. In Phase II, a small randomized control
  trial will be conducted with 60 community members to assess the efficacy of biobanking
  educational materials in increasing knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy,
  and intentions to donate biospecimens to a biobank. The study will compare a multimedia
  biobanking educational intervention developed by TBCCN, with the National Cancer
  Institute brochure titled Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need to Know
  (NCI brochure). BANKS data will be collected following study enrollment (baseline),
  and then participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups
  (TBCCN multimedia intervention or NCI brochure). Follow-up interviews using the
  BANKS will be conducted between 7 and 14 days after enrollment. Participants' medical
  records will be reviewed to assess group differences in biospecimen donation consent
  rates. Result(s): Using a CBPR approach, the project has successfully developed
  and validated a culturally and linguistically appropriate instrument to assess community
  members' knowledge, attitudes, intention, and self-efficacy related to biospecimen
  donation. The BANKS is comprised of 21 attitudes items, 17 knowledge items, 11 self-efficacy
  items, and 2 intention items. Phase II of the study is expected to provide preliminary
  data on the efficacy of a multimedia biobanking educational intervention in improving
  perceptions of biospecimen donation and biobanking. Conclusion(s): Using a CBPR
  approach, data collected during this study have yielded a culturally appropriate
  instrument to assess community members' perceptions about biobanking, the BANKS.
  The next step in the study is to use the BANKS to evaluate a multimedia biobanking
  intervention in increasing knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and intention
  to donate biospecimens to a biobank among racial/ethnically and linguistically diverse
  populations in Tampa Bay, Florida."
