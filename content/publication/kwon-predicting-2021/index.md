abstract: While there is a substantial amount of work studying multilingualism's effect
  on cognitive functions, little is known about how the multilingual experience modulates
  the brain as a whole. In this study, we analyzed data of over 1,000 children from
  the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine whether monolinguals
  and multilinguals differ in executive function, functional brain connectivity, and
  brain-behavior associations. We observed significantly better performance from multilingual
  children than monolinguals in working-memory tasks. In one finding, we were able
  to classify multilinguals from monolinguals using only their whole-brain functional
  connectome at rest and during an emotional n-back task. Compared to monolinguals,
  the multilingual group had different functional connectivity mainly in the occipital
  lobe and subcortical areas during the emotional n-back task and in the occipital
  lobe and prefrontal cortex at rest. In contrast, we did not find any differences
  in behavioral performance and functional connectivity when performing a stop-signal
  task. As a second finding, we investigated the degree to which behavior is reflected
  in the brain by implementing a connectome-based behavior prediction approach. The
  multilingual group showed a significant correlation between observed and connectome-predicted
  individual working-memory performance scores, while the monolingual group did not
  show any correlations. Overall, our observations suggest that multilingualism enhances
  executive function and reliably modulates the corresponding brain functional connectome,
  distinguishing multilinguals from monolinguals even at the developmental stage.
