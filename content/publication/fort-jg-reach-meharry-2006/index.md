abstract: "An important national health care effort is elimination of racial and ethnic
  disparities in six specific conditions: infant mortality, cancer screening and management,
  cardiovascular disease, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and child
  and adult immunizations. To address this concern, several health entities in Nashville,
  Tennessee responded to a grant initiative from the Centers for Disease Control and
  Prevention to develop a Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH)
  demonstration project. The resulting award is the Nashville REACH 2010 Project,
  charged to develop sustainable methods to reduce and, in time, eliminate racial
  and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the North Nashville
  community, where mortality rates of these diseases are substantially higher than
  in other parts of the county. As one of its many interests, the project included
  potential health care providers to receive and disseminate messages about disease
  prevention and health education. The present paper describes the community-campus
  partnership between the Nashville REACH 2010 project and the post-baccalaureate
  program of Meharry Medical College, a partnership that enfolded Meharry's pre-professional
  health care students into the community-based participatory service research project
  to increase the awareness and sensitivity of future minority health care providers
  to issues in minority and poor, underserved populations and to increase potential
  providers' familiarity with the processes involved in community-based participatory
  research."
