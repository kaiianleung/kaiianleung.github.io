abstract: 'Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are associated with an increased risk of
  developing various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
  Parkinson’s disease (PD), and most notably, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
  While the clinical presentation of AD and PD is well established, CTE can only be
  diagnosed post-mortem. Therefore, a distinction can be made between the pathologically
  defined CTE and RHI-related functional or structural brain changes (RHI-BC) which
  may result in CTE. Unfortunately, there are currently no accepted biomarkers of
  CTE nor RHI-BC, a major hurdle to achieving clinical diagnoses. Interestingly, speech
  has shown promise as a potential biomarker of both AD and PD, being used to accurately
  classify individuals with AD and PD from those without. Given the overlapping symptoms
  between CTE, RHI-BC, PD and AD, we aimed to determine if speech could be used to
  identify individuals with a history of RHI from those without. We therefore created
  the Verus dataset, consisting of 13 second voice recordings from 605 professional
  fighters (RHI group) and 605 professional athletes in non-contact sports (control
  group) for a total of 1210 recordings. Using a deep learning approach, we achieved
  85% accuracy in detecting individuals with a history of RHI from those without.
  We then used our model trained on the Verus dataset to fine-tune on publicly available
  AD and PD speech datasets and achieved new state-of-the-art accuracies of 84.99%
  on the AD dataset and 89% on the PD dataset. Finding a biomarker of CTE and RHI-BC
  that presents early in disease progression is critical to improve risk management
  and patient outcome. Our study is the first we are aware of to investigate speech
  as such a candidate biomarker of RHI-BC.Competing Interest StatementM Ravanelli
