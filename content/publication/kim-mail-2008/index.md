abstract: Many Korean American persons have hypertension, but competing life priorities
  often prevent them from attending health-promotion educational activities. Using
  principles of community-based participatory research, the authors conducted a prospective
  clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of a mailed vs an in-class culturally
  tailored education intervention. A total of 380 hypertensive Korean American persons
  from the Baltimore/Washington area were assigned to a more intense in-class education
  group or a less intensive mail education group. Evaluation of postintervention blood
  pressure (BP) outcomes revealed that significant reductions in systolic BP (13.3
  mm Hg and 16.1 mm Hg, respectively) and diastolic BP (9.5 mm Hg and 10.9 mm Hg)
  and increases in BP control rates (42.3% and 54.3%) were achieved in both groups.
  No significant differences in BP outcomes between groups, however, were found. In
  conclusion, education by mail was an effective strategy for improving BP control
  and may be a viable approach for other immigrant groups if the education materials
  address their cultural needs.
