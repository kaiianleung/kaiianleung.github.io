abstract: Among young adults fof color, both sense of community and ethnic identity,
  as developmental processes, have been associated with wellness, empowerment, and
  civic action. Additional research is needed that provides empirical support for
  the connection between psychological sense of community and ethnic identity on outcomes
  that relate to human development such as intrapersonal psychological empowerment,
  civic engagement, and depression symptoms. The current study of young adults of
  color (N=243; 70% Hispanic/Chicano(a)/Spanish and 10% American Indian/Native American;
  70% female) investigates heterogeneity according to dimensions of psychological
  sense of community and the ethnic identity construct. Latent profile analyses (LPA)
  were conducted. Using LPA, five profile groups emerged. Profile group differences
  were present on reported levels of intrapersonal psychological empowerment, civic
  engagement, and depression symptoms. Majority of sample participants were classified
  with moderate to high psychological sense of community and ethnic identity. Findings
  provide insights for efforts on developing community belongingness based on ethnic
  group identity and engaging young adults in civic life.Copyright Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals
