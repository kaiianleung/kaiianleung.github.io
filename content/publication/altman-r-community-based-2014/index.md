abstract: 'Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death
  in women, yet significant health disparities exist for high-risk groups, including
  Latinas, and comprehensive, culturally relevant, and effective prevention intervention
  models are lacking. We used a systems approach to develop, assess, and pilot a community-based
  education program for improving outcomes for knowledge/awareness of CVD, cardiometabolic
  risk, and health behaviors in Latinas. Method(s): Latinas (n=35, mean age 50) participated
  in a 4-month community-based bilingual preventive cardiovascular education program.
  Pre/post analyses were for knowledge/awareness of CVD risk factors, symptoms, calling
  911; personal risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, family history of CVD);
  clinical parameters (weight, body mass index [BMI], waist, blood pressure, fasting
  lipids, and glucose); diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS); and serum inflammatory
  markers (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, high-sensitivity C reactive protein
  [hsCRP], and interleukin [IL]-12). Result(s): Baseline knowledge/awareness was relatively
  low, risk factors and MetS prevalent, and serum inflammatory markers elevated. Postintervention,
  participants demonstrated significant (ptextless0.05) improvements in knowledge
  of symptoms, risk factors for CVD, calling 911, and knowledge/adoption of heart-healthy
  behaviors. Clinical health status also improved, especially for serum triglycerides
  (ptextless0.05; 21% decline), prevalence of MetS (from 43% to 37% of participants),
  and serum levels of the proinflammatory TNF-alpha (from 16.9+/-1.11apg/mL to 13.5+/-0.8apg/mL,
  ptextless0.05). Conclusion(s): A bilingual culturally appropriate community-based
  CVD-prevention program based on health education, medical screenings, and empowerment
  is a successful, effective, adaptable, and replicable model to significantly improve
  cardiometabolic risk in Latinas. Â© 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.'
