abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Increasing treatment uptake among people who inject
  drugs (PWID) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is integral to eliminating
  viral hepatitis. This study explored the role of community-based outreach in engaging
  and retaining Australian PWID in the testing component of the HCV care cascade.
  DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 PWID, including
  new initiates to injecting and those from culturally and linguistically diverse
  (CALD) backgrounds, who acquired HCV infection while enrolled in a community-based
  prospective observational study of hepatitis C vaccine preparedness in Sydney. Participants
  were interviewed at diagnosis and 12 months later. Transcripts were thematically
  analysed using constant comparative techniques. RESULT(S): Community-based outreach
  was effective in engaging newly infected participants in HCV monitoring and decision-making
  about seeking interferon-based treatment. Key factors in the acceptability of outreach
  were privacy and discretion, and opportunities to build trust with non-judgmental
  staff. Retaining participants in the HCV cascade of care required more than a one-off
  session of post-test counselling. Ongoing discussions with staff enabled paced and
  tailored delivery of information about HCV prevention, testing and treatment. Increased
  understanding of the role of HCV ribonucleic acid viremia in determining the need
  for treatment, and access to this testing, was pivotal in making HCV monitoring
  salient for participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Outreach is an effective
  strategy for engaging new initiates to injecting and CALD PWID in HCV testing and
  decision-making about treatment. Findings highlight the need to increase availability
  and access to HCV ribonucleic acid testing for PWID.Copyright Â© 2019 Australasian
