abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Community-based Bilingual Doulas (CBDs) are women from migrant
  communities trained to support and comfort migrant women during labour and birth,
  and to facilitate linguistic and cultural communication between women, their partners
  and staff. The aim of the study was to describe CBDs' experiences of supporting
  migrant women during labour and birth, working alongside caregivers, and to explore
  CBDs perceptions of their work situation in a Swedish setting. METHOD(S): As part
  of an ongoing randomised trial of CBD support in XX, Sweden, semi-structured individual
  interviews were conducted with nine of the 35 participating CBDs. The interviews
  were conducted in each CBD's first language (Arabic, Somali, Tigrinya, Russian,
  Polish) or in Swedish, and were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated
  into English. Thematic analysis of data identified, analysed, interpreted and reported
  patterns and themes across the data. RESULT(S): The overarching theme which emerged
  was \\\"Multi-tasking bilingual doulas bridging gaps - despite standing on fragile
  ground\\\". To reach out a helping hand and receive appreciation from the women
  when their needs were met, motivated the CBDs to continue despite the constraints
  related to roles, working conditions and boundaries. The CBDs felt proud of being
  acknowledged, although they did also feel a need for more supervision and education.
  CONCLUSION(S): The CBDs experienced their doula tasks as meaningful and emotionally
  rewarding, which mostly outweighed the challenges of their work which they saw as
  insecure, exhausting and underpaid. If CBDs are implemented on a larger scale, the
  scope of their role (including boundaries), education, access to supervision and
  working conditions all need to be better addressed.Copyright Â© 2021. Published by
