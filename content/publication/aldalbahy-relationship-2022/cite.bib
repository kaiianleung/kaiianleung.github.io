 abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between code-switching and language proficiency. The study also attempted to explain how Saudi bilingual female students view code-switching in relation to language proficiency and deficiency. A questionnaire and an elicited production task were used to collect data. A sample size of 24 Saudi female students from the English department at King Saud University participated in the questionnaire. In addition, six Saudi female students from the same department were taken for the purpose of carrying out the task. The collected data was analyzed by using percentages, a content analysis technique, and a simple frequency count. Findings and results indicated that there is a correlation between the type of code-switching and language proficiency. The results also revealed that the frequency of code-switching was not related to the level of language proficiency of participants. Positive attitudes towards using code-switching were found among the participants. Based on the results, it could be concluded that code-switching is not a sign of language incompetency. Instead, code-switching is a tool that the majority of participants preferred while speaking with bilinguals.},
