abstract: This study investigated the relationship between code-switching and language
  proficiency. The study also attempted to explain how Saudi bilingual female students
  view code-switching in relation to language proficiency and deficiency. A questionnaire
  and an elicited production task were used to collect data. A sample size of 24 Saudi
  female students from the English department at King Saud University participated
  in the questionnaire. In addition, six Saudi female students from the same department
  were taken for the purpose of carrying out the task. The collected data was analyzed
  by using percentages, a content analysis technique, and a simple frequency count.
  Findings and results indicated that there is a correlation between the type of code-switching
  and language proficiency. The results also revealed that the frequency of code-switching
  was not related to the level of language proficiency of participants. Positive attitudes
  towards using code-switching were found among the participants. Based on the results,
  it could be concluded that code-switching is not a sign of language incompetency.
  Instead, code-switching is a tool that the majority of participants preferred while
  speaking with bilinguals.
