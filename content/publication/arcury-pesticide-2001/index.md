abstract: Migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the United States are now overwhelmingly
  immigrants from Mexico. Pesticide exposure among these farmworkers is a major occupational
  health concern; however, little research has considered the agricultural pesticide
  use and safety experiences of these workers in their communities of origin. This
  analysis uses survey data collected by the PACE project to delineate the farming
  and pesticide use experiences of Mexican-born farmworkers in North Carolina. Over
  80 percent of the 277 Mexican-born farmworkers had done agricultural work in Mexico,
  including work on their own farms (93%) and as hired farm labor (35%). Almost two-thirds
  of those farmworkers with farming experience had used pesticides, but only about
  one-third of those who used pesticides had received pesticide safety training or
  information. Most of those who used pesticides had used some form of safety equipment.
  Those who had worked as hired farm labor in Mexico were more likely to have used
  pesticides and safety equipment, and to have received safety training and information.
  Those who spoke an indigenous language at home rather than Spanish were less likely
  to have used pesticides and to have received safety training and information. These
  results demonstrate that farmworkers coming to the U.S. from Mexico arrive with
  a variety of experiences with pesticide usage and pesticide safety training. Such
  experiences form the framework within which farmworkers understand the relationship
  of pesticide usage to human health. It is important for occupational health and
  safety programs directed to farmworkers in the U.S. to consider the experiences
  these workers bring from their communities of origin.
