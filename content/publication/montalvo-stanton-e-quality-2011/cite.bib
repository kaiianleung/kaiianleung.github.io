 abstract = {Rationale: The Children's RESPIRA Education Program (RESPIRA) is a project initiated in 2006 that promotes equitable healthcare for asthmatic children. RESPIRA empowers Latino families to become proactive, educated and in control of managing their child's asthma. Our program provides bilingual asthma education in Spanish/English followed by home visits and quality of life survey which each family receives upon completion of the program. The goal is to reduce ED visits and hospitalizations by empowering these families to improve their quality of life by changing behavior patterns. We achieved this by developing and utilizing this best practice medical education model which assist the underserved families in NJ. Method(s): Our project provides comprehensive bilingual medical and education services to Latino families in 8 NJ counties through schools, daycare centers, community and faith based organizations. We service families with asthmatic children from 6 months to 21 years of age. The program educates both parents and children. The parents are educated by a bilingual health educator while the children are taught by a bilingual public health representative. The bilingual presentation covers pathogenesis, triggers and treatment of asthma. Home and folk remedies, an integral part of the Latino culture are also discussed. Pre and post -test are given to parents and children to assess changes in asthma knowledge as are standardized age appropriate asthma control test. Three weeks after completion of the education program, an initial home visit is conducted by the health educator and public health representative to re-enforce asthma education, assess environmental triggers at home, review the child's action plan and provide guidance to school service agencies if needed. Six to eight weeks later a follow-up visit is made. A quality of life survey is done for families who complete the program with their consent to determine if there has been a decrease in hospitalizations or ED visits. Result(s): By January 2010, 540 families and 655 children have been enrolled with quality of life survey results for 109 families. After completion of the program ED visits were reduced by 19.3% and hospital admission by 8.3%. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): The RESPIRA program has succeeded in decreasing both ED visits and hospitalizations within those families completing the quality of life survey. We anticipate significant cost savings which are still in the process of being analyzed. By providing comprehensive medical -educational services to Latino families with asthmatic children, we have improved their quality of life.},
