abstract: "PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness
  of tailoring community-based diabetes intervention to Asian immigrant cultures.,
  METHODS: The Cochrane processes and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
  and Meta-Analyses recommendations guided this systematic review. PubMed, the Cumulative
  Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid, and PsycINFO were searched
  for analyses and syntheses of primary research published since 2000 that described
  interventions tailored for the cultures of Asian immigrants with diabetes. This
  search yielded a total of 9 articles published from 2005 to 2013. The Amsterdam-Maastricht
  Consensus List for Quality Assessment was used to assess the quality of the studies.,
  RESULTS: Retrieved studies' populations were foreign-born adults textgreater50 years
  of age with type 2 diabetes. The review revealed that culturally tailored diabetes
  programs are effective at improving patients' objectively measured clinical outcomes,
  in particular A1C levels, and psychobehavioral outcomes. Patients were also highly
  satisfied with bilingual health care providers and bilingual educational programs.,
  CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of tailoring diabetes
  interventions to Asian immigrant populations' cultures. Further studies, including
  longitudinal studies and studies with rigorous research designs that subclassify
  Asian immigrants, are needed to encourage the implementation of culturally tailored
  diabetes intervention for this ethnic minority.Copyright Â© 2014 The Author(s)."
