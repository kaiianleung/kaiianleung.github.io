abstract: Although bilingual programmes were implemented in Spain a few years ago,
  a recent report on these English-Spanish programmes points out that they can still
  be improved (Dobson, Pérez y Johnstone, 2010). To improve these programmes, we aim
  to present a proposal based on the use of concept maps for the formative and summative
  assessment in content and language integra- ted learning (CLIL) developed in non-linguistic
  disciplines (DNL). Since evaluation constitutes a method of necessary feedback for
  teachers and students, the method instructors use to mea- sure students’ knowledge
  will impact the students’ school performance. Feedback will also help learners to
  recall previously learned information. (Hoffmann, 2003). Consequently, this paper
  is presented as a brief bibliographic review to make DNL teachers reflect on the
  way summative exam design impacts the students’ academic ego during evaluation.
