abstract: "INTRODUCTION: This is a preliminary report from a research collaboration
  between Asian Health Services (community health center); Koreans in Alameda County,
  California; and the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health.
  This five-year Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project supports a collaborative
  community intervention to improve breast and cervical cancer screening behavior
  among Korean women., METHODS: A Korean Community Advisory Board and Korean-American
  staff were recruited, and community sensitive research (CSR) and participatory action
  research (PAR) principles were applied: (1) building community infrastructure for
  sustainable action, (2) cultural appropriateness, (3) assuring responsiveness to
  community needs, and (4) a prevention focus that would assist health care providers.
  We conducted a population-based telephone survey on 676 Korean adults (272 men and
  404 women)., RESULTS: The collaborative process yielded (1) a high response rate
  (79%), (2) baseline health information on Korean Americans, (3) broadening of the
  original research topic, (4) survey responses that will guide intervention design,
  (5) culturally competent strategies, and (6) expanded Korean-American Community
  capacity for local action., CONCLUSIONS: Research collaboration between universities,
  community-based organizations, and ethnic communities can yield high-quality research.
  CSR and PAR approaches help break through cultural barriers in otherwise \\\"hard
  to reach\\\" API sub-populations. Determinants of success include sharing common
  goals; trust, honesty, and integrity; shared decision making; mutual respect of
  each partner's expertise; cultural sensitivity and cultural competence; flexibility,
  good communication, and mutual learning; and continuity of partners. Actively engaging
  members of the study population in the research process builds community capacity,
  thus laying the foundation for future projects that improve health status."
