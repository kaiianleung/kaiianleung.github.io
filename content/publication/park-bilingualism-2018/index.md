abstract: 'Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate whether dual language
  experience affects procedural learning ability in typically developing children
  and in children with specific language impairment (SLI)., Method: We examined procedural
  learning in monolingual and bilingual school-aged children (ages 8-12 years) with
  and without SLI. The typically developing children (35 monolinguals, 24 bilinguals)
  and the children with SLI (17 monolinguals, 10 bilinguals) completed a serial reaction
  time task., Results: The typically developing monolinguals and bilinguals exhibited
  equivalent sequential learning effects, but neither group with SLI exhibited learning
  of sequential patterns on the serial reaction time task., Conclusion: Procedural
  learning does not appear to be modified by language experience, supporting the notion
  that it is a child-intrinsic language learning mechanism that is minimally malleable
  to experience.'
