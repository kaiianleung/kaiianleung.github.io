 abstract = {Background: In the background of a rising burden of dementia globally, the Tata Longitudinal study of Cognitive aging was initiated in to identify risk and protective factors for dementia relevant to a developing country like India. Method(s): A study protocol was developed that reliably captures cognitive status, a range of lifestyle factors, and multimodality biomarkers for dementia, specific to the Indian context. Subsequently, a community cohort of elderly individuals in the South Indian city of Hyderabad and adjoining areas was created who were comprehensively studied for clinical and cognitive status, laboratory investigations, brain imaging according to ADNI II protocol, and Apo E genotype. Result(s): Of the first 104 participants recruited, age range was 50-87 years, 43% were women, rate of illiteracy was 22%, 15% belonged to lower socioeconomic status, 29% were engaged in unskilled elementary occupations and 13% were from rural backgrounds, a profile representative of the diversity in local demographics. More than half had cardiovascular risk factors, 66.5% of individuals had white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI and 7.5% had silent brain infarcts. We explored the factors that were most likely to be associated with cognitive functioning: literacy, years of education, bilingualism, urban dwelling, skilled and professional occupations, physical activity in late life, lifetime experiences and social networking correlated positively with cognitive status. On Univariate General Linear Model years of education and physical exercise in late life were independently associated with higher cognitive scores. Conclusion(s): This first longitudinal community-based study of cognitive decline from India will provide an opportunity to investigate cognitive resilience against dementia, specific to the Indian context.},
