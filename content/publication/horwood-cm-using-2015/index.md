abstract: 'Introduction: Achieving long-Term retention in HIV care is an important
  challenge for HIV management and achieving elimination of mother-To-child transmission.
  Sustainable, affordable strategies are required to achieve this, including strengthening
  of community-based interventions. Deployment of community-based health workers (CHWs)
  can improve health outcomes but there is a need to identify systems to support and
  maintain high-quality performance. Quality-improvement strategies have been successfully
  implemented to improve quality and coverage of healthcare in facilities and could
  provide a framework to support community-based interventions. Method(s): Four community-based
  quality-improvement projects from South Africa, Malawi and Mozambique are described.
  Community-based improvement teams linked to the facility-based health system participated
  in learning networks (modified Breakthrough Series), and used quality-improvement
  methods to improve process performance. Teams were guided by trained quality mentors
  who used local data to help nurses and CHWs identify gaps in service provision and
  test solutions. Learning network participants gathered at intervals to share progress
  and identify successful strategies for improvement. Result(s): CHWs demonstrated
  understanding of quality-improvement concepts, tools and methods, and implemented
  quality-improvement projects successfully. Challenges of using quality-improvement
  approaches in community settings included adapting processes, particularly data
  reporting, to the education level and first language of community members. Conclusion(s):
  Quality-improvement techniques can be implemented by CHWs to improve outcomes in
  community settings but these approaches require adaptation and additional mentoring
  support to be successful. More research is required to establish the effectiveness
  of this approach on processes and outcomes of care.Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer
