abstract: "OBJECTIVES: As part of a larger study exploring psychosocial factors that
  influence self-care and use of health care services during pregnancy, we investigated
  the process of pregnancy discovery and acceptance among a culturally diverse group
  of women who had given birth to their first child in the year preceding data collection.
  METHODS: Eighty-seven low-income women from four cultural groups (African American,
  Mexican, Puerto Rican, and white) participated in eight focus groups held in their
  communities. The focus groups were ethnically homogenous and stratified by early
  and late entry into prenatal care. A social influence model guided the development
  of focus group questions, and the study followed a participatory action research
  model, with community members involved in all phases of the research. RESULTS: Issues
  that emerged from the focus groups as possible influences on timing of pregnancy
  recognition include the role of pregnancy signs and symptoms and pregnancy risk
  perception in the discovery process, the role of social network members in labeling
  and affirming the pregnancy, concerns about disclosure, 'planning' status of the
  pregnancy, and perceived availability of choices for resolving an unintended pregnancy.
  CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy discovery process is complex, and when protracted, can
  potentially result in delayed initiation of both prenatal care and healthful pregnancy
  behaviors. Enhancing our understanding of pregnancy discovery and acceptance has
  clear implications for primary and secondary prevention. Future research is needed
  to further explain the trajectory of pregnancy discovery and acceptance and its
  influence on health behaviors and pregnancy outcome."
