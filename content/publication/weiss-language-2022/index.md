abstract: Longitudinal studies provide the unique opportunity to test whether early
  language provides a scaffolding for the acquisition of the ability to read. This
  study tests the hypothesis that parental language input during the first 2 years
  of life predicts emergent literacy skills at 5 years of age, and that white matter
  development observed early in the 3rd year (at 26 months) may help to account for
  these effects. We collected naturalistic recordings of parent and child language
  at 6, 10, 14, 18, and 24 months using the Language ENvironment Analysis system (LENA)
  in a group of typically developing infants. We then examined the relationship between
  language measures during infancy and follow-up measures of reading related skills
  at age 5 years, in the same group of participants (N = 53). A subset of these children
  also completed diffusion and quantitative MRI scans at age 2 years (N = 20). Within
  this subgroup, diffusion tractography was used to identify white matter pathways
  that are considered critical to language and reading development, namely, the arcuate
  fasciculus (AF), superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and inferior occipital-frontal
  fasciculus. Quantitative macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping was used to
  characterize myelin density within these separately defined regions of interest.
  The longitudinal data were then used to test correlations between early language
  input and output, white matter measures at age 2 years, and pre-literacy skills
  at age 5 years. Parental language input, child speech output, and parent-child conversational
  turns correlated with pre-literacy skills, as well as myelin density estimates within
  the left arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Mediation analyses indicated
  that the left AF accounted for longitudinal relationships between infant home language
  measures and 5-year letter identification and letter-sound knowledge, suggesting
  that the left AF myelination at 2 years may serve as a mechanism by which early
  language experience supports emergent literacy. Copyright Â© 2022 Weiss, Huber, Ferjan
