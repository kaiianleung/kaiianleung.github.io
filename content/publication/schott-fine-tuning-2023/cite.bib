 abstract = {The ability to differentiate between two languages sets the stage for bilingual learning. Infants can discriminate languages when hearing long passages, but language switches often occur on short time scales with few cues to language identity. As bilingual infants begin learning sequences of sounds and words, how do they detect the dynamics of two languages? In two studies using the head-turn preference procedure, we investigated whether infants (n = 44) can discriminate languages at the level of individual words. In Study 1, monolingual and bilingual 8- to 12-month-olds were tested on their detection of single-word language switching in lists of words (e.g., “dog… lait [fr. milk]”). In Study 2, they were tested on language switching within sentences (e.g., “Do you like the lait?”). Infants detected language switching within sentences, but not in lists of words. Moreover, there was no difference between bilingual and monolingual infants’ performance. Based on these contrasting effects for natural sentences versus lists of words, we conclude that infants may detect language switches more successfully if preceded by sequences of sounds and words in a single language. The ability to detect disruptions in such sequences is likely important in supporting the beginnings of bilingual proficiency.},
