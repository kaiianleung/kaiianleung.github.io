abstract: The ability to differentiate between two languages sets the stage for bilingual
  learning. Infants can discriminate languages when hearing long passages, but language
  switches often occur on short time scales with few cues to language identity. As
  bilingual infants begin learning sequences of sounds and words, how do they detect
  the dynamics of two languages? In two studies using the head-turn preference procedure,
  we investigated whether infants (n = 44) can discriminate languages at the level
  of individual words. In Study 1, monolingual and bilingual 8- to 12-month-olds were
  tested on their detection of single-word language switching in lists of words (e.g.,
  “dog… lait [fr. milk]”). In Study 2, they were tested on language switching within
  sentences (e.g., “Do you like the lait?”). Infants detected language switching within
  sentences, but not in lists of words. Moreover, there was no difference between
  bilingual and monolingual infants’ performance. Based on these contrasting effects
  for natural sentences versus lists of words, we conclude that infants may detect
  language switches more successfully if preceded by sequences of sounds and words
  in a single language. The ability to detect disruptions in such sequences is likely
  important in supporting the beginnings of bilingual proficiency.
