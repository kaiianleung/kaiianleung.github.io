 abstract = {This article documents a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging dataset deposited in Deep Blue Data. The dataset included neuroimaging and behavioral data from N = 343 children aged 5-11 with a diverse linguistic background, including children who are English monolingual, Chinese-English, and Spanish-English bilingual. Children completed phonological and morphological awareness tasks in each of their languages during fNIRS neuroimaging. They also completed a wide range of language and reading tasks. Parents filled in questionnaires to report children's demographic information as well as their home language and literacy backgrounds. The dataset is valuable for researchers in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience to further investigate questions such as the effects of bilingualism on children's neural basis for literacy development.
