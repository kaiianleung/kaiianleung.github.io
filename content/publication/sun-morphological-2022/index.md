abstract: This article documents a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging
  dataset deposited in Deep Blue Data. The dataset included neuroimaging and behavioral
  data from N = 343 children aged 5-11 with a diverse linguistic background, including
  children who are English monolingual, Chinese-English, and Spanish-English bilingual.
  Children completed phonological and morphological awareness tasks in each of their
  languages during fNIRS neuroimaging. They also completed a wide range of language
  and reading tasks. Parents filled in questionnaires to report children's demographic
  information as well as their home language and literacy backgrounds. The dataset
  is valuable for researchers in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience
  to further investigate questions such as the effects of bilingualism on children's
  neural basis for literacy development. Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by
