 abstract = {Background: Health Works is a Federally Qualified Health Center serving the Northern Virginia area. Ninety percent of the center's families live within 200% of Federal Poverty Line and 69% would be best served in a language other than English. Breastfeeding clinical services and support were largely unavailable for low-income dyads in the county. Objective(s): 1. Use a population health intervention model to approach the problem. 2. Use evidence-based care for effective practice. 3. Increase breastfeeding rates to approach Healthy- People 2020 goals. Materials/Methods: A systematic integrated approach was taken based on the Prevention Institute's Clinical/Community Population Health Intervention Model: 1. Inquiry 2. Assessment 3. Action. Result(s): The Loudoun Breastfeeding Coalition was formed with key stakeholders from the community. Clinical service points and gaps from prenatal to early childhood were analyzed and streamlined. A clinical breastfeeding center with bilingual staff was established. Best-practice clinical protocols were implemented and built into the electronic health record. In 2013, the center provided more than 140 consultations to more than 90 low-income women. The dyads who received lactation support were more likely to breastfeed exclusively at 2, 4, 6 and 9-12 months than those dyads who did not receive support (32% vs. 24%, 20% vs. 13%, and 17% vs. 13%, respectively). Conclusion(s): A best-practice community-based approach was implemented to increase breastfeeding rates in a community health center.},
