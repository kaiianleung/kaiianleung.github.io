abstract: "BACKGROUND: Despite rapid growth, Latino communities' mental health needs
  are unmet by existing services and research. Barriers may vary by geographic locations,
  but often include language, insurance coverage, immigration status, cultural beliefs,
  and lack of services. OBJECTIVE(S): The aim of this research was development of
  a cross-sectional instrument to assess the mental health status, beliefs, and knowledge
  of resources among rural and urban Latinos residing in a Midwestern state. METHOD(S):
  The purpose of this article is to describe the community-based participatory research
  (CBPR) process of instrument development and lessons learned. RESULT(S): A culturally
  relevant, 100-item bilingual survey instrument was developed by community and academic
  partners. LESSONS LEARNED: Community-based participatory research methods are salient
  for sensitive health topics and varied research objectives, including instrument
  development. To ensure cultural and social relevance of research, community participation
  is crucial at all stages of research, including developing the research question
  and instrument."
