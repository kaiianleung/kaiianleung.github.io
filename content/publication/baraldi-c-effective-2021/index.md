abstract: "Modern patient-centered approaches increasingly recognize the contribution
  of patients' knowledge in interactions with health-care personnel. Effective involvement
  is exceptionally difficult when patients are migrants with limited command of specialized
  language. Interactional practices that promote effective distribution of knowledge
  and access to it are needed: by doctors interacting directly with patients in a
  shared language and by mediators providing interpreting services across different
  languages. In this paper, we look at two types of sequence which seem to be effective
  in involving (migrant) patients. The first concerns clinicians' reactions to spontaneous
  patients' initiatives, like claims to knowledge or personal narratives. The second
  concerns interpreters' explanations when they render the clinicians' instructions
  to the patients. While both sequences are clearly designed to promote patients'
  participation, they need particular communicative competence on the part of staff,
  clinicians, and interpreters."
