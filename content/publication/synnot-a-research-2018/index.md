abstract: "Objective To identify research priorities of consumers and other stakeholders
  to inform Cochrane Reviews in 'health communication and participation' (including
  such concepts as patient experience, shared decision-making and health literacy).
  Setting International. Participants We included anyone with an interest in health
  communication and participation. Up to 151 participants (18-80 years; 117 female)
  across 12 countries took part, including 48 consumers (patients, carers, consumer
  representatives) and 75 professionals (health professionals, policymakers, researchers)
  (plus 25 people who identified as both). Design Survey. Methods We invited people
  to submit their research ideas via an online survey open for 4 weeks. Using inductive
  thematic analysis, we generated priority research topics, then classified these
  into broader themes. Results Participants submitted 200 research ideas, which we
  grouped into 21 priority topics. Key research priorities included: Insufficient
  consumer involvement in research (19 responses), 'official' health information is
  contradictory and hard to understand (18 responses), communication/coordination
  breakdowns in health services (15 responses), health information provision a low
  priority for health professionals (15 responses), insufficient eliciting of patient
  preferences (14 responses), health services poorly understand/implement patient-centred
  care (14 responses), lack of holistic care impacting healthcare quality and safety
  (13 responses) and inadequate consumer involvement in service design (11 responses).
  These priorities encompassed acute and community health settings, with implications
  for policy and research. Priority populations of interest included people from diverse
  cultural and linguistic backgrounds, carers, and people with low educational attainment,
  or mental illness. Most frequently suggested interventions focused on training and
  cultural change activities for health services and health professionals. Conclusions
  Consumers and other stakeholders want research addressing structural and cultural
  challenges in health services (eg, lack of holistic, patient-centred, culturally
  safe care) and building health professionals' communication skills. Solutions should
  be devised in partnership with consumers, and focus on the needs of vulnerable groups.Copyright
