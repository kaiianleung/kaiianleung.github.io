abstract: Research involving monolinguals has demonstrated that language impairment
  can be noticed in the early years and tends to persist into adolescence. More recently,
  research has begun to address the challenges of identifying and treating Developmental
  Language Disorders (DLD) in English Language Learners (ELLs). Developmental patterns
  of DLD are not necessarily consistent over time, and we hypothesized that some monolinguals
  and ELLs go \"under the radar\" in lower grades but their language difficulties
  become more pronounced in later years, as syntactic demands increase, hence \"late-emerging
  DLD\". This longitudinal study examined (a) the existence of late-emerging DLD in
  Grades 4-6 in English-speaking monolinguals and ELLs, and (b) the Grade 1 and 3
  cognitive and language profiles that predict late-emerging DLD. This study involved
  monolinguals (n = 149), and ELLs (n = 402) coming from diverse home language backgrounds.
  Cognitive (working memory, phonological short-term memory, processing speed), language
  (vocabulary and syntax), and word reading skills were assessed annually from grades
  1 to 6. Separate parallel analyses in the monolingual and ELL samples confirmed
  that late-emerging DLD exists in both groups. In comparison with their typically
  developing peers, late-emerging DLD can be identified as early as Grade 1 based
  on poorer performance on phonological awareness, naming speed, and working memory.
