abstract: This paper describes some findings from an evaluation of the effectiveness
  of a community development project that aimed to overcome inequalities in mental
  health care experienced by members of the local black and minority ethnic (BME)
  communities. A participatory action research design was used, involving people from
  BME communities who had experienced mental health problems and external stakeholders.
  The study relied largely on qualitative methodology. Findings reported here indicate
  that participants in the project valued the culturally and spiritually relevant
  support they received, but felt that more opportunities were needed for training
  and employment, greater representation on the project's management committee, and
  greater awareness of the project in the community. External stakeholders felt that
  the project gained credibility from its community base and valued its ability to
  work across faith traditions and cultures. It was also seen as successful in acting
  as a bridge between the communities and statutory services, although there were
  concerns about the project's relationship with frontline services. The paper proposes
  two models of community development that primary care trusts may wish to adopt -
  radical or consensus, or a mixture of both - in order to address inequalities in
  mental health service provision.
