abstract: OBJECTIVE - Although Caribbean Latinos are two to three times more likely
  than non-Hispanic whites to develop diabetes, cultural influences on nutrition and
  health are poorly understood. To provide insight into important features of diabetes
  prevention and management, we conducted focus groups to explore nutrition practices
  and health beliefs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Thirty low-income urban Caribbean
  Latinos with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and four family members
  participated in four focus group interviews that were conducted in Boston and Cambridge,
  Massachusetts. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, were tape recorded, and were
  led and analyzed by Latino professionals from a community-based health organization.
  RESULTS - Consistent themes described by participants were feelings of social isolation,
  little understanding of long-term consequences of diabetes, fatalism regarding the
  course of the disease, multiple barriers to diet and exercise interventions, skepticism
  regarding the value of preventive health behaviors, prevalent use of traditional
  nonmedical remedies, and a clear need for culturally sensitive health-care providers
  and services. CONCLUSIONS - The information from focus groups provides useful information
  for planning innovative intervention programs for chronic disease risk reduction
  that emphasize practical skills development, family/peer networks, empowerment techniques,
  and bilingual providers. We conclude that the focus group technique can be used
  effectively with low-income, urban minority populations to provide information on
  lifestyle behaviors and beliefs regarding chronic diseases that impact on health
  and nutritional status.
