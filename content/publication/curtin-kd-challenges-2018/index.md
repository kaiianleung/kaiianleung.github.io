abstract: "Immigrants to Canada are less likely to be physically active compared with
  non-immigrants, and the interrelations between personal and environmental factors
  that influence physical activity for immigrants are largely unexplored. The goal
  of this qualitative descriptive study was to understand how the experience of being
  new to Canada impacts opportunities and participation in physical activity. Two
  focus group interviews with immigrants to Canada were conducted. The first group
  ( n=7) included multicultural health brokers. The second group ( n=14) included
  English as a second language students. Qualitative content analysis was used to
  determine three themes consistent with the research question: transition to Canadian
  life, commitments and priorities, and accessibility. Discussion was framed using
  a social ecological model. Implications for practice and policy are suggested including
  enhanced community engagement, and organizational modifications. Overall, the development
  and implementation of physical activity policies and practices for newcomers to
  Canada should be centered on newcomers' perspectives and experiences."
