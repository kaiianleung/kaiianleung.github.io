abstract: 'To evaluate the participant experience of the Neighborhood Produce Market
  (NPM), a mobile fresh food pantry, in a small Mid-Atlantic city. A participatory
  approach used to implement a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study. Adult NPM participants
  with children in the household and primary language of English, Spanish, and/or
  Arabic. Through a collaboration of food bank, university, and hospital community
  outreach partners, NPM offers fresh, free produce and nutrition education with food
  samples to families at risk of food insecurity. Since its inception in 2017, NPM
  has served over 300 families and 500 children in 20 neighborhoods. Four phases informed
  by collaborative partners with assistance from Spanish and Arabic interpreters/translators:
  16 interviews to inform survey development; survey development with closed- and
  open-ended items and testing; survey translation and testing; and survey data collection
  using Qualtrics. Content analysis and descriptive statistics conducted for interview
  and survey data, respectively. Among interviewees (14 females; 2 males), half of
  the interviews were conducted in English, 31% in Spanish, and 19% in Arabic. Major
  themes categorized by benefits, impact on family fruit and vegetable intake, food
  access norms, and suggestions. Survey completed by 40 participants (34 females;
  6 males) in Spanish (40%), Arabic (32%), English (28%). Over 95% reported NPM connected
  people in the communities and had a positive impact on physical or financial health
  of families. Most respondents (97%) were introduced to new foods, with 80% reporting
  their children tried new foods. Over 85% reported they and their household members
  ate more fresh vegetables due to the NPM. Only 11% reported being uncomfortable
  getting food from the NPM. Suggestions included marketing, accessibility, and variety/quantity
  of foods. There may be benefits to using a mobile fresh food pantry model like NPM
  for multilingual communities. Findings may be useful to nutrition educators to meet
  participant fruit and vegetable needs in similar communities.'
