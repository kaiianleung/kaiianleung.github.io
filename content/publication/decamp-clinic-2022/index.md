abstract: 'Background: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends referral
  of all obese children to intensive weight management programs. When available, programs
  are limited to clinical settings and do not address social determinants of health
  barriers to healthy weight among Latinx immigrant families. Active and Healthy Families,
  a Spanish-language, culturally tailored group visit intervention has demonstrated
  effectiveness in decreasing child body mass index but does not address barriers
  to frequent engagement with the health care system nor social determinants other
  than immigration. Adapting the intervention for community-based delivery, and to
  address additional social determinants, may facilitate participation and increase
  acceptability and engagement among Latinx immigrant families. Purpose: To engage
  a stakeholder network in planning adaptations of an evidence-based weight management
  intervention for community-based implementation. Method: Guided by the intervention
  mapping-adapt process, we solicited feedback from a stakeholder network from August
  2018 to March 2020. The stakeholder network assessed fit, planned adaptations and
  identified essential intervention components using photovoice, a Participatory Action
  Research method, and meetings incorporating user-centered design approaches. Results:
  The stakeholder network membership included Latinx immigrant families, community
  leaders, health care delivery experts, and researchers. Planned adaptations included
  curriculum changes to discuss social determinants barriers to behavior change and
  goal setting to mitigate them. Conclusions: We successfully engaged a stakeholder
  network and, using a systematic process, identified adaptations of an evidence-based
  weight management intervention to allow for community-based implementation. Sustainably
  addressing obesity disparities for Latinx children also requires addressing structural
  factors to reduce social determinants of health barriers at the population level.'
