abstract: 'Background: One of the tenets of cultural competence is that community
  based organizations who serve the public be constantly aware of, and up-to-date
  on changing demographics within the community being served. The communication of
  information on changing demographics to Federal agencies such as HRSA, allows for
  timely allocation of resources that will enable grantees to meet the needs of emerging
  populations as they engage in outreach. To that end, during the 2009 funded period,
  the National Coordinating and Evaluation Center (NCEC) surveyed grantees participating
  in the Sickle Cell Disease Newborn Screening Program on their experiences and outreach
  with emerging populations. Method(s): Mixed methods were used to collect data. Grantees
  participated in telephone interviews conducted from October 2008 - February 2009.
  The interviews were recorded and later transcribed. In September 2009, grantees
  submitted written information on populations served and estimates of number of clients
  served within each group. Grantees also provided summaries of current and proposed
  activities designed to meet the needs of these clients. Result(s): NCEC grantees
  provide services to individuals from emerging populations including Latino/Hispanic
  (111), Asian (36) and African (11) populations. Grantees report a significant number
  of clients from Haiti and the Virgin Islands, and one grantee reported that they
  provide services to 23 Cambodian and Montagnard clients. NCEC grantees strive to
  meet the needs of these clients in a variety of ways including employing bilingual
  staff, providing interpretation services and translated educational materials, providing
  case management and social service support or referral, and facilitating population-specific
  support groups. Spanish was the most common language used by clients from emerging
  populations. Other languages noted were Portuguese, French, African Tribal dialects,
  Creole, Vietnamese and Hmong. Projects report a wide range of socio-economic and
  educational levels. Many needs and assets were identified which include time needed
  by agencies to learn about other populations and learn how to bridge the cultural
  gap; utilizing already established agencies or churches within the community to
  teach about SCD and the services available. Grantees expressed the need for educational
  materials in languages other than English and for materials written at an even lower
  literacy level for clients who may not be literate in their own language. Conclusion(s):
  Grantees are utilizing many and varied methods to serve emerging populations and
  have been attentive to communicating the changing demographics among the populations
  that they serve.'
