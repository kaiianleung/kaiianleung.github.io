abstract: Objective. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) was launched in 1998 to address
  the disproportionate rates of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
  syndrome (HIV/AIDS) among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an evaluation to assess
  the influence of MAI in four communities, and the extent to which these communities
  increased their capacity to meet the HIV prevention needs of racial and ethnic minorities.
  Design. Retrospective data were collected annually through individual interviews
  over three years. Individual interviews were conducted with community stakeholders
  across the three waves of data collection. Data were analyzed using standardized
  qualitative methods including codebook development, coding, inter-coder agreement
  assessments, and data interpretation. This paper will highlight one area of inquiry
  - community stakeholders' perceptions of the impact of MAI in their communities.
  Results. Community stakeholders reported that MAI increased capacity to respond
  to the HIV epidemic and provide services to racial and ethnic minorities. Specifically,
  MAI was perceived to have increased community empowerment, involvement, and awareness
  of HIV/AIDS; expanded HIV-related services and organizational self-sufficiency;
  and improved collaboration and the coordination of services in the community. Although
  recognizing MAI gave national focus to the impact of the epidemic on minority communities,
  respondents raised concerns about the implementation process and the lack of sustainability
  planning. Conclusion. MAI represented an initial national attempt to address the
  disproportionate rates of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. However,
  other strategies are also needed to address these significant health disparities.
  At CDC, steps are currently underway to develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent
  and reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. As community
  stakeholders are critical partners in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV, strengthening
  their capacity and promoting their involvement can help combat the epidemic.
