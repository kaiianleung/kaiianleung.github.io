 abstract = {Background Little is known about COVID-19 information-seeking experiences for culturally and linguistically diverse groups in Australia.Methods Participants were recruited using a cross-sectional survey from March 21 to July 9, 2021, translated into 11 languages, and with supporting bilingual staff. Linear regression models identified factors associated with difficulty finding easy-to-understand COVID-19 information.Results Across 708 participants (88% born overseas, 31% poor English proficiency), difficulty finding easy-to-understand COVID-19 information was rated 4.13 for English materials (95%CI: 3.85 to 4.41) and 4.36 for translated materials (95%CI: 4.07 to 4.66) (1 easy to 10 hard). Participants who were older (p&lt;0.001), had inadequate health literacy (Mean Difference (MD)=-1.43, 95%CI -2.03 to - 0.82, p&lt;0.001), or poor English proficiency (MD=-1.9, 95%CI-2.51 to -1.29, p&lt;0.001) found it harder to find easy-to-understand English-language COVID-19 information. Those who had greater difficulty finding easy-to-understand translated COVID-19 information were younger (p=0.004), had poor English proficiency (MD=-1.61, 95%CI -2.29 to -0.9, p&lt;0.001), university education (MD=0.77, 95%CI 0.00 to 1.53, p=0.05), and had spent longer living in Australia (p=0.001). They were more likely to rely on friends and family for COVID-19 information (p=0.02). There was significant variation in information-seeking experiences across language groups (p’s&lt;0.001).Conclusions Easy-to-understand and accessible COVID-19 information is needed to meet the needs of people in culturally and linguistically diverse communities. This approach should involve working alongside these communities to tailor messages and leverage existing communication channels.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo specific project funding; academic authors supported by National Health and Medical Research Council, Heart Foundation, and Western Sydney Local Health District.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (Project number 2020/ETH3085) gave ethical approval for this workI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
