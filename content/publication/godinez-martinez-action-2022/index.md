abstract: The purpose of this investigation was to explore how reflective practice
  (RP) could be implemented and systematized in diverse ELT Mexican contexts in order
  to foster continuous professional development. Hence, this collaborative action
  research was conducted over aperiod of 22 months with different English Language
  Teaching (ELT) practitioners; 24 Mexican teacher educators and two in-serviceEnglish
  language teachers from Longford, Ireland and Texas, USA who were living and working
  in Mexico. The data was collected by means of classroom observations, feedback sessions,
  individual interviews, and professional dialogues–informal meetings, self-reporting,and
  text messaging. Overall, the findings of this investigation showed that teachers,
  who had the openness to challenge inconsistencies, gaps and at times fears in their
  teaching stances, beliefs and therefore practices, also had the willingness to carry
  out reflective actions that were guided by critical inquiry, collaboration with
  the researcher and modelled practices by other colleagues; enabling teacher effective
  engagement in reflective procedures as well as in personal continuous professional
  development processes.
