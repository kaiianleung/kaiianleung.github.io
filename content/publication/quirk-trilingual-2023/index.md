abstract: Family language strategies are approaches that parents adopt for language
  use with their multilingual children. In bilingual contexts, these strategies influence
  children’s language exposure and development (Macleod et al., 2022). In the more
  complex context of trilingualism, how families settle on strategies and their relationship
  with exposure may differ. Here, we studied 31 families raising trilingual toddlers
  aged 18-36 months living in Montreal with English, French – the city’s two community
  languages – and various heritage languages. Families’ language strategy and language
  background, children’s exposure, and parents’ attitudes and concerns towards children’s
  trilingualism were assessed. The most frequent strategies adopted involved mixed
  use of a community and heritage language with children. Strategies that excluded
  the community languages at home were associated with lower parent proficiency in
  the community languages and higher heritage language exposure. Mixed strategies
  led to more balanced exposure to the three languages. Attitudes towards trilingualism
  were favorable, concerns were weak, and neither showed a relationship with family
  language strategy choice. These findings shed new light on unique features of trilingual
  language environments and open future directions for research on how they relate
  to the development of three languages.
