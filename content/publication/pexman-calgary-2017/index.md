abstract: Psycholinguistic research has been advanced by the development of word recognition
  megastudies. For instance, the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) provides
  researchers with access to naming and lexical-decision latencies for over 40,000
  words. In the present work, we extended the megastudy approach to a task that emphasizes
  semantic processing. Using a concrete/abstract semantic decision (i.e., does the
  word refer to something concrete or abstract?), we collected decision latencies
  and accuracy rates for 10,000 English words. The stimuli were concrete and abstract
  words selected from Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kupermanâ€™s (2013) comprehensive list
  of concreteness ratings. In total, 321 participants provided responses to 1,000
  words each. Whereas semantic effects tend to be quite modest in naming and lexical
  decision studies, analyses of the concrete/abstract semantic decision responses
  show that a substantial proportion of variance can be explained by semantic variables.
  The item-level and trial-level data will be useful for other researchers interested
  in the semantic processing of concrete and abstract words.
