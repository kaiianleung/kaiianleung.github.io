abstract: The aim of this paper is to assess the role of culture in shaping individual
  preferences to- wards different long-term care (LTC) arrangements. The analysis
  uses Swiss data from two administrative databases covering the universe of formal
  LTC providers between 2007 and 2013. Switzerland is a multi-cultural confederation
  where state administrative borders do not always coincide with cultural groups.
  For this reason, we exploit the within-state variation in cultural groups to show
  evidence about cultural differences in LTC use. In particular, we use spatial regression
  discontinuity design (RDD) at the language border between French-speaking and German-speaking
  individuals living in bilingual cantons to provide causal interpretation of the
  differences in formal LTC use between these two main cultural groups. Our results
  suggest a strong role of culture in shaping household decisions about formal LTC
  use. In particular, elderly people residing in regions speaking a Latin language
  (French, Italian and Romansh) use home-based care services more intensely and enter
  in nursing homes at older ages and in worse health conditions with respect to elderly
  people in German regions. This difference across the two cultural groups are driven
  by different preferences towards LTC arrangements. Long-term care, Culture, Spatial
