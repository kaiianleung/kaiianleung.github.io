abstract: This paper discusses how the organizational cultural competency of social
  service agencies may be improved by shifting the philosophy of service delivery
  from a client-centered to a community-based orientation. This analysis is based
  on two years of fieldwork and interviews that were conducted as part of an action
  research project initially developed to increase the number of certified Spanish
  speaking Latino family childcare providers and knowledge about Latino immigrant
  families in the Midwest. In developing a culturally-specific certification program
  in Spanish, both the Latino participants and the bilingual program director challenged
  the agency to consider how the social context and social location of its participants
  required a more holistic community approach. Â© Springer Science+Business Media,
