abstract: 'Background: In Australia, the burden of chronic hepatitis B is not evenly
  distributed. A priority population is people from culturally and linguistically
  diverse (CALD) backgrounds who encounter several barriers, including stigma, discrimination,
  language difficulties, and diminished access to health care. More than half of patients
  with chronic hepatitis B infection are unaware of their status and may not access
  health care; and, when they do, it is overshadowed by other priorities. Point-of-care
  (POC) testing, when used in combination with increased awareness programs, may overcome
  some of these barriers. Aim(s): The aim of this pilot study is to assess the role
  and effectiveness of hepatitis B POC testing in the CALD community setting, to heighten
  awareness and facilitate education and dialogue about hepatitis B. By using POC
  testing as a means to engage with these communities, we hope to destigmatize and
  overcome barriers to accessing health care, while providing a simple and valuable
  service for those who may never have a chance of being screened. Method(s): Community
  events with individuals from CALD backgrounds were targeted between May 2015 and
  August 2016. Attendees were provided with culturally appropriate educational resources
  and offered the finger-prick Point of Care HBsAg Rapid test (Standard Diagnostics).
  Results were available within 30 minutes. Post-test counselling and followup were
  provided for those with positive or negative results, presenting a further engagement
  opportunity. Result(s): A total of eight community events involving individuals
  from CALD backgrounds were included. Of the 679 individuals approached, 259 (38.1%)
  were screened for hepatitis B infection using the POC test. Of the 259 individuals
  screened, six (2.3%) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and 62 results
  (23.9%) were invalid. Reasons for not pursuing screening included known hepatitis
  B status, fear of knowing hepatitis B status, or fear of needle-stick injuries.
  These individuals were still provided with information and educated about vaccination,
  testing, and treatment options. Conclusion(s): Over 250 POC tests were performed
  on individuals who were not aware of their hepatitis B status in at-risk communities.
  This provided opportunities for direct engagement, education, and discussion about
  hepatitis B. Furthermore, patients were encouraged to discuss this with family members
  and contacts. By being visible and present at community events, we endeavor to destigmatize
  hepatitis B POC testing in CALD communities through engagement and education, while
  providing testing for hepatitis B with immediate results, thereby overcoming the
  barriers commonly encountered by this population.'
