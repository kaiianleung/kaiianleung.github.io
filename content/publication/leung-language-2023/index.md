abstract: "Aim: Although many children who experience ischemic stroke come from bilingual
  backgrounds, it is unclear whether bilingual exposure affects poststroke development.
  Our research evaluates bilingual and monolingual exposure on linguistic/cognitive
  development poststroke across 3 stroke-onset groups. Method: An institutional stroke
  registry and medical charts were used to gather data on 237 children across 3 stroke-onset
  groups: neonatal, textless28 days; first-year, 28 days to 12 months; and childhood,
  13 months to 18 years. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM), administered
  several times poststroke, was used to evaluate cognition and linguistic development.
  Results: Similar cognitive outcomes were observed across language groups. However,
  an interaction effect with stroke-onset group was observed, with monolinguals in
  the first-year group having worse productive language outcomes as compared to bilinguals.
  Interpretation: Overall, no detrimental effects of bilingualism were found on children's
  poststroke cognition and linguistic development. Our study suggests that a bilingual
  environment may facilitate language development in children poststroke."
