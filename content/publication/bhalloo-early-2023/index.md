abstract: 'Purpose Literacy precursors are cognitive, linguistic, and oral-language
  skills that predict future reading skills in children as young as 4 years. Speech-language
  pathologists and educators utilize these precursors as assessment tools to identify
  children at risk for reading difficulties. Most current tools are developed based
  on monolinguals (predominantly in English), despite the significant percentage of
  bilinguals globally. As such, bilingual children are typically assessed on tools
  developed for monolinguals in research and clinical settings. Despite this common
  practice, there is a lack of comprehensive synthesis on whether these precursors
  are a reliable indicator of reading skills in bilingual children. Our paper examines
  whether literacy precursors commonly used with monolinguals are associated with
  literacy development in simultaneous bilinguals.Method Following PRISMA and Cochrane
  guidelines, our review includes four databases (LLBA, ERIC, MLA, and PsycINFO),
  in addition to gray-literature and manual reference-list searches. To control for
  age of acquisition and language dominance variability, we included typically-developing
  simultaneous bilinguals exposed to both languages before age 3 (N=5,942). We analyzed
  reported statistical associations between code-related or oral-language precursors
  and reading outcome measures, using correlational meta-analyses.Results The 41 reports,
  that met inclusion/exclusion criteria, were published between 1977-2022. The average
  age at assessment was 7;5 years (range: 3;0 - 11;0 years), with children speaking
  over 21 bilingual language combinations. Our meta-analysis demonstrated significant
  within-language correlations and cross-language transfer effects for code-related
  (e.g., phonological awareness) and oral-language (e.g., vocabulary, morphological
  awareness) precursors. Semantic awareness, however, was not a reliable predictor
  in bilinguals.Conclusions Phonological awareness and vocabulary measures – even
  if originally developed for monolingual children - can form a meaningful component
  of early literacy assessment in simultaneous bilingual children: these precursors
  may be used as assessment tools across heritage and societal languages in research
  and clinical practice. Future research suggestions within this domain are also discussed.Competing

  that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial
  registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively,
  please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not
  registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines
