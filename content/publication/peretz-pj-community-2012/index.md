abstract: In 2005, local leaders in New York City developed the Washington Heights/Inwood
  Network for Asthma Program to address the burden of asthma in their community. Bilingual
  community health workers based in community organizations and the local hospital
  provided culturally appropriate education and support to families who needed help
  managing asthma. Families participating in the yearlong care coordination program
  received comprehensive asthma education, home environmental assessments, trigger
  reduction strategies, and clinical and social referrals. Since 2006, 472 families
  have enrolled in the yearlong program. After 12 months, hospitalizations and emergency
  department visits decreased by more than 50%, and caregiver confidence in controlling
  the child's asthma increased to nearly 100%. Key to the program's success was the
  commitment and involvement of community partners from program inception to date.
