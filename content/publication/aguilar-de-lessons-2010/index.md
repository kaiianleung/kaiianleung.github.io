abstract: 'In recent years, community-based coalitions have become an effective channel
  to addressing various health problems within specific ethnic communities. The purpose
  of this article is twofold: (a) to describe the process involved in building the
  Kalusugan Coalition (KC), a Filipino American health coalition based in New York
  City, and (b) to highlight the lessons learned and the challenges from this collaborative
  venture. The challenges described also offer insights on how the coalition development
  process can be greatly affected by the partnership with an academic institution
  on a community-based research project. Because each cultural group has unique issues
  and concerns, the theoretical framework used by KC offers creative alternatives
  to address some of the challenges regarding coalition infrastructures, leadership
  development, unexpected change of coalition dynamics, and cultural nuances.'
