abstract: 'Diseases related to poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) are major
  causes of mortality and morbidity. While pursuing marketing approaches to WaSH to
  improve health outcomes is often narrowly associated with monetary exchange, marketing
  theory recognises four broad marketing exchange archetypes: market-based, non-market-based,
  command-based and culturally determined. This diversity reflects the need for parameters
  broader than monetary exchange when improving WaSH. This study applied a participatory
  action research process to investigate how impoverished communities in Melanesian
  urban and peri-urban informal settlements attempt to meet their WaSH needs through
  marketing exchange. Exchanges of all four archetypes were present, often in combination.
  Motivations for participating in the marketing exchanges were based on social relationships
  alongside WaSH needs, health aspirations and financial circumstances. By leveraging
  these motivations and pre-existing, self-determined marketing exchanges, WaSH practitioners
  may be able to foster WaSH marketing exchanges consistent with local context and
  capabilities, in turn improving community physical, mental and social health.'
