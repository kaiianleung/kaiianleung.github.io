abstract: Diabetes prevention requires lifestyle changes, and traditional educational
  programs for lifestyle changes have had low attendance rates in ethnic populations.
  This article describes the development and implementation of an educational program,
  emphasizing retention strategies, cultural tailoring and community participation.
  Community-based participatory research approaches were used to adapt and test the
  feasibility of a culturally tailored lifestyle intervention (named Health is Wealth)
  for Filipino-American adults at risk for diabetes (n = 40) in order to increase
  program attendance. A unique feature of this program was the flexibility of scheduling
  the eight classes, and inclusion of activities, foods and proverbs consistent with
  Filipino culture. We found that with this approach, overall program attendance for
  the experimental and wait-listed control groups was 88% and participant satisfaction
  was high with 93% very satisfied. Flexible scheduling, a bilingual facilitator for
  the classes, and the community-academic partnership contributed to the high attendance
  for this lifestyle intervention.
