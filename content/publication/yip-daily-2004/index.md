abstract: Approximately 100 American youths of Chinese descent participated in a 14-day
  diary study, completing daily reports on ethnic feelings, American feelings, ethnic
  community involvement, and psychological well-being. Participants were divided into
  4 identity orientations (Chinese, American, bicultural, or other) and then assessed
  for differential patterns of mental health and community involvement. Chinese-centered
  identities were characterized by positive well-being and positive self-esteem. However,
  the American-centered and bicultural groups had well-being and self-esteem levels
  equal to that of the Chinese-centered group. Although the measures of menial health
  failed to differentiate the identity categories, both the Chinese- and bicultural-centered
  groups showed high involvement in Chinese culture, whereas American-centered participants
  were, significantly less involved. Copyright 2004 APA
