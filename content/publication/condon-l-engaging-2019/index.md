abstract: Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller people are marginalized worldwide and experience
  severe health inequalities, even in comparison to other ethnic minority groups.
  While diverse and hard to categorize, these communities are highly cohesive and
  members have a strong sense of identity as a group apart from the majority population.
  Researchers commonly experience challenges in accessing, recruiting, and retaining
  research participants from these communities, linked to their outsider status, insular
  nature, and history of discrimination. In this article, the challenges and the opportunities
  of engaging Gypsies, Roma, and Travellers in a multicenter qualitative research
  project are discussed. The management of public involvement and community engagement
  in this U.K.-based project provides insights into conducting research effectively
  with ethnically and linguistically diverse communities, often considered to be \"hard
  to reach.\"
