abstract: "Indigenous groups are often associated with poverty and so are low levels
  of education. Guatemala and Bolivia are the two Latin American countries in which
  the ethnic part of the population is proportionately greatest, with Bolivia being
  more schooled than Guatemala. So the author tried to determine how levels of ethnicity
  and education affect the level of worker earnings. His investigation was based on
  data from household surveys in the two countries. He found that, other things being
  equal, indigenous people who acquire more human capital enjoy greater economic rewards
  than those who acquire less. Just giving ethnic groups basic education is bound
  to improve their position. This finding was supported by both within country and
  cross-country evidence: indigenous people fare better in Bolivia (where there is
  more education) than in Guatemala (where there is less). One possible (although
  controversial) intervention is to provide schooling in the child's first language.
  Such an intervention has been successfully implemented on a small scale in Guatemala.
  Bilingual programs also exist, on a small scale, in Bolivia. Poverty Assessment,Gender
