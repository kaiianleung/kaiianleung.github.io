abstract: 'Although there are a number of standardised measures to assess dyslexia
  in children, there are comparatively fewer instruments suitable for the assessment
  of dyslexia in adults. Given the growing number of students entering UK higher education
  institutions, there is a need to develop reliable tools for assessing the additional
  needs of those with dyslexia and related difficulties. This study reports data from
  a revised version of the York Adult Assessment: An Assessment Battery for Dyslexia
  Screening in Higher Education. The current York Adult Assessment-Revised (YAA-R)
  is an assessment battery consisting of tests of reading, spelling, writing and phonological
  skills. Data from a normative sample of 106 adults without dyslexia and a validation
  sample of 20 adults with dyslexia illustrate significant group differences on the
  tests comprising the YAA-R. Additionally, the YAA-R has good discriminatory power
  yielding 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Taken together, the YAA-R is a suitable
  test battery for the assessment and identification of dyslexia in university students.'
