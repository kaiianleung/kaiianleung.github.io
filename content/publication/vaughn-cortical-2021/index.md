abstract: There is a growing body of evidence based on adult neuroimaging that suggests
  that the brain adapts to bilingual experiences to support language proficiency.
  The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is a useful source of data
  for evaluating this claim during childhood, as it involves data from a large sample
  of American children. Using the baseline ABCD Study data collected at ages nine
  and ten, the goal of this study was to identify differences in cortical thickness
  between bilinguals and monolinguals and to evaluate how variability in English vocabulary
  and English use within bilinguals might explain these group differences. We identified
  bilingual participants as children who spoke a non-English language and were exposed
  to the non-English language at home. We then identified a matched sample of English
  monolingual participants based on age, sex, pubertal status, parent education, household
  income, non-verbal IQ, and handedness. Bilinguals had thinner cortex than monolinguals
  in widespread cortical regions. Within bilinguals, more English use was associated
  with greater frontal and parietal cortical thickness; greater English vocabulary
  was associated with greater frontal and temporal cortical thickness. These findings
  replicate and extend previous research with bilingual children and highlight unexplained
  cortical thickness differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Copyright Â©
