 abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health emergency requiring an effective public health response including citizen’s roles in preventing spread and controlling the pandemic. Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs and behaviors in-relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among the general public and to identify associated factors.Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May - June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID-19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure strength and direction of relationships.Results Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r=0.19, p&lt;0.01) and attitude-practice (r=0.08, p&lt;0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p&lt; 0.01). Province, place of residence, ecological area, age, gender and caste/ethnicity were also significantly associated with KAP score of participants.Conclusion The study found varying degrees of correlation between Knowledge, Attitude and Practice that may increase as the pandemic evolves in Nepal. Knowledge and level of education had positive associations with attitude and adherence of precautionary measures. The findings suggest a need for targeted community awareness interventions for the most vulnerable populations, men, those with no school education, the elderly and people living in rural areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding available for this researchAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) - ERB Protocol Registration No. 317/2020P.
