abstract: While there is ample evidence that monolingual children with Autism Spectrum
  Disorders (ASD) face difficulties with narrative story-telling and executive functions
  (EF), there is considerable uncertainty about how bilingualism impacts these skills
  in autism. The current study explores the effect of bilingualism on the narrative
  and EF skills of forty 7-to-12-year-old bilingual and monolingual children with
  ASD, as well as forty age-matched bilingual and monolingual children of typical
  development (TD). Narrative production data were elicited using the Edmonton Narrative
  Norms Instrument (ENNI; Schneider et al., 2005), which was developed to measure
  narrative production at a microstructural and macrostructural level. The same children
  were administered two EF tasks, namely, a global-local visual attention task and
  a 2-back working memory task. In story-telling, bilingual children with ASD achieved
  higher scores than monolingual children with ASD on story structure complexity and
  use of adverbial clauses, and they tended to use significantly fewer ambiguous referential
  forms than their monolingual peers with ASD. In the global-local task, bilingual
  children with ASD were faster and more accurate in global trials than monolingual
  children with ASD, who tended to be more susceptible to interference from locally
  presented information than the other experimental groups. Higher accuracy and faster
  response times were also observed for bilingual children with ASD in the 2-back
  task. Further correlation analyses between the story-telling and EF tasks revealed
  that bilingual children with ASD drew on a broader range of EF in narrative production
  than their monolingual peers. The overall findings reveal that bilingual children
  with ASD outperformed their monolingual peers with ASD in both the microstructure
  and macrostructure of their narrative production, as well as in their visual attention
  and working memory skills. Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
