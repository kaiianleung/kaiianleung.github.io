abstract: "Objective: To increase Aboriginal participation with mainstream health
  professionals in an Aboriginal health and well-being centre. Design(s): Participatory
  Action Research using Aboriginal traditional symbolism to depict aspects of the
  research process, interview surveys and a document review. Setting(s): A regional
  town with 629 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents and a newly established
  Aboriginal health and well-being centre (Nunyara). Participant(s): Thirty Aboriginal
  community members were interviewed about their involvement with Nunyara and their
  health issues. Participants were selected through purposive 'pass-me-around' sampling
  to ensure that all family groups were included. Result(s): The results are presented
  in two areas: the structure of the Aboriginal community that affects participation
  and community views about health issues. Aboriginal people living in the town come
  from 10 or more different language groups and relate almost exclusively within their
  own groups. Activities at Nunyara were seen as individual family group events and
  not for everyone. Aboriginal community participants had a broad view of health as
  they reported problems that included smoking and alcohol use. Almost all would like
  more involvement in health issues through Nunyara. Conclusion(s): Aboriginal community
  members are willing to get involved in health issues in collaboration with Nunyara.
  However, fundamental to increasing participation is to bring people together from
  different family groups and increase social cohesion. This can be done through developing
  relationships with groups enabling different points of view to be heard and valued.
