abstract: 'Objective: To develop and refine a complex intervention for diabetes support
  and education in minority ethnic groups, delivered through bilingual health advocates.
  Design(s): Action research framework-a variety of methods used in an emergent and
  developmental manner, in partnership with clinicians, managers, and service users,
  drawing especially but not exclusively on narrative methods. Setting(s): Deprived
  inner London district Interventions: Development and evaluation of three components
  of the complex intervention: a group based learning set for bilingual health advocates,
  in which stories about clients with diabetes formed the basis for action learning;
  advocate led support and education groups for people with diabetes, which used personal
  stories as the raw material for learning and action; organisational support to help
  to develop these new models and embed them within existing services. Result(s):
  Both advocate groups and user groups were popular and well evaluated. Through storytelling,
  advocates identified and met their own educational needs in relation to diabetes
  and the unmet needs of service users. In the advocate led user groups, story fragments
  were exchanged in a seemingly chaotic way that the research team initially found
  difficult to facilitate or follow. Stories were not so much told as enacted and
  were often centred on discussion of \"what to do.\" Whereas some organisations welcomed,
  successfully implemented, and sustained the advocate led groups, others failed to
  do so. A key component of the complex intervention was organisational support. Conclusion(s):
  An action research approach allowed engagement with an underserved group of health
  service staff and with hard to reach service users. The study produced subjective
  benefits to these groups locally as well as a worked-up complex intervention that
  will now be formally tested in a randomised controlled trial.'
