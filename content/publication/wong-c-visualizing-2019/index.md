abstract: 'This study developed and evaluated a visual approach to promoting environmental
  health literacy about highway pollution. The Interactive Map of Chinatown Traffic
  Pollution was the centerpiece of a communication approach designed to make complex
  scientific information about traffic-related air pollution comprehensible to Chinese
  immigrants with limited English proficiency. The map enabled visualization of the
  spatial distribution of ultrafine particles (less than 100 nanometers in diameter),
  a toxic and invisible form of air pollution, in Boston Chinatown. A university-community
  partnership enabled design of intergenerational training sessions aimed toward empowering
  community members to take health-promoting actions that reduce exposure to ultrafine
  particulate pollution. A mixed methods approach was taken to evaluation. Nine high
  school youth learned to use the map and then tutored adults recruited from English
  as a Second Language (ESL) classes and from a community workshop. Seventy-three
  of these adults completed a pre-post survey measuring change in three domains: pollution
  knowledge, attitudes toward environmental issues, and self-efficacy in using maps.
  Adult participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all three
  domains (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, all p textless 0.01). Seventeen adults and nine
  youth participated in interviews. Interview participants reported adjusting daily
  routines to reduce exposure to pollution.'
