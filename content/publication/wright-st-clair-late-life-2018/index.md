abstract: New Zealand’s political, civic, health and social institutions have been
  criticised as being ill-prepared to serve the health and social needs of the country’s
  increasingly diverse ageing population. This grounded theory study examined how
  late-life Asian immigrants participate in community to influence their subjective
  health. Bilingual Chinese, Indian, and Korean local intermediaries and research
  assistants were engaged as collaborative research partners. Purposive recruitment,
  and later theoretical sampling, were used to identify the 24 Chinese, 27 Indian,
  and 25 Korean participants, aged 60-83, who were 1-19 years post-immigration. Data
  were gathered through nine focus groups, and 15 individual interviews in the participants’
  language of choice. All data were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated
  to English for analysis. Data analysis was done using open coding, constant comparative
  analysis and dimensional analysis. Strengthening community was the core social process
  in the substantive theory developed. The participants actively advanced cultural
  connectedness and gave service with, and for, each other. Over time, they extended
  their focus toward doing so for the wider community. They purposely used long-standing,
  occupation-related skills to resource how they and their co-ethnic groups contributed
  to community health. Additionally, they sought novel opportunities to diversify
  their contributions. These late-life immigrants intentionally strove to stay healthy
  through doing. Achieving collective, as well as personal, health through community
  participation was for the sake of minimising potential burdens on the country’s
  health system. The results indicate good health promotion policies would aim to
  advance co-ethnic, socially embedded networks for late-life Asian immigrants.
