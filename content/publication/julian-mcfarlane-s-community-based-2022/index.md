abstract: There has not been a significant improvement in the rate of clinical trial
  accrual in more than 20 years. Worse, the challenge of inadequate representation
  among racial and ethnic minorities also persists, deepening disparities in health.
  Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is a participatory communication method
  that centers on effective dialogue between researchers and community stakeholders
  with the goal of creating an equitable partnership for health and social change.
  The objective of the current study was to provide an update since a systematic review
  in 2012, on the current status of the empirical research, with a particular focus
  on the elements of CBPR methods used to improve the rate of accrual of members of
  racial and ethnic minority communities for clinical trials. Our systematic review
  found a large increase in the number of CBPR related studies and studies related
  to racial and ethnic representation in research. More than 85% of studies employing
  CBPR methods saw statistically positive outcomes. Specifically, the elements of
  CBPR that are associated with these positive outcomes include community partner
  participation in (1) a study advisory committee, (2) data collection, (3) the development
  of interventions, and (4) participant recruitment. However, the results of our study
  indicate that researchers need to be more transparent about the extent of community
  participation as well as more thoroughly and accurately describe the nature of the
  partnership with members of minority communities in order to build upon the scientific
  literature on community-engaged methods.
