abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To systematically review physical activity interventions among
  culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations and explore the strategies
  used to recruit CALD populations, the cultural adaptations made in these interventions,
  and the cultural adaptations used among successful interventions. DESIGN: Four electronic
  databases (Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL) was searched in March 2017 and
  re-run in January 2018. Manual screening of the reference lists of the included
  studies was also conducted. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic
  review were: intervention studies (e.g. controlled and non-controlled studies),
  physical activity as primary outcome and as the only health behaviour targeted,
  culturally and linguistically diverse population of interest, published in English,
  and targeted adult populations (i.e. aged textgreater=18). RESULT(S): A total of
  19 articles were included in this review, comprising 15 unique studies. Most studies
  targeted Latino populations, published in the United States, and targeted women.
  An array of recruitment strategies were used, such as recruiting from religious
  establishments or religious and cultural events, and community organisations and
  events. The majority of studies made cultural adaptations to their intervention
  to suit the CALD population of interest, however, the level of detail of reported
  adjustments was limited. Successful interventions were those that generally included
  community consultation to inform their intervention, language adjustments, community
  health workers/bilingual/bicultural personnel for intervention delivery, recruitment,
  and data-collection, and using culturally-relevant intervention material. CONCLUSION(S):
  Although many studies included in this review reported increases in physical activity
  at follow-up, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the lower level
  of methodological quality and reporting on study methodology. Future interventions
  designed for CALD populations should be of greater methodological quality and also
  provide a greater level of transparency in terms of the cultural adaptations that
  have been made to the intervention.'
