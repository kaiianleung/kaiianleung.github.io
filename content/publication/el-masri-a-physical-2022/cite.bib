 abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically review physical activity interventions among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations and explore the strategies used to recruit CALD populations, the cultural adaptations made in these interventions, and the cultural adaptations used among successful interventions. DESIGN: Four electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL) was searched in March 2017 and re-run in January 2018. Manual screening of the reference lists of the included studies was also conducted. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review were: intervention studies (e.g. controlled and non-controlled studies), physical activity as primary outcome and as the only health behaviour targeted, culturally and linguistically diverse population of interest, published in English, and targeted adult populations (i.e. aged \textgreater=18). RESULT(S): A total of 19 articles were included in this review, comprising 15 unique studies. Most studies targeted Latino populations, published in the United States, and targeted women. An array of recruitment strategies were used, such as recruiting from religious establishments or religious and cultural events, and community organisations and events. The majority of studies made cultural adaptations to their intervention to suit the CALD population of interest, however, the level of detail of reported adjustments was limited. Successful interventions were those that generally included community consultation to inform their intervention, language adjustments, community health workers/bilingual/bicultural personnel for intervention delivery, recruitment, and data-collection, and using culturally-relevant intervention material. CONCLUSION(S): Although many studies included in this review reported increases in physical activity at follow-up, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the lower level of methodological quality and reporting on study methodology. Future interventions designed for CALD populations should be of greater methodological quality and also provide a greater level of transparency in terms of the cultural adaptations that have been made to the intervention.},
