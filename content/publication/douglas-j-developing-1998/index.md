abstract: This paper outlines and reviews research methodologies developed in the
  Smethwick Heart Action Research Project in relation to their ability to ascertain
  and document the needs and experiences of black and minority ethnic communities.
  One of the aims of the research was to document inequalities that existed in the
  health experiences of black and minority ethnic communities in Smethwick, and hence
  appropriate research methodologies were needed which were able to examine differences
  between ethnic groups, genders and socio-economic groups. A number of areas were
  explored in developing anti-oppresssive and participatory research methodologies,
  in particular strategies for sampling black and minority ethnic populations, matching
  interviewers to respondents for language and ethnicity, and the effect of the 'race'
  of the interviewer. This first paper outlines the methodologies developed, the following
  paper will discuss the findings of the research.
