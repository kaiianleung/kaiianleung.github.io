 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Latina immigrants and Haitian women are 15-30 percentage points less likely to be screened for cervical cancer than Non-Hispanics whites (NHWs). Testing for the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is gaining increased acceptance for cervical cancer screening. A major advantage of this approach is that with minimal instruction women can perform the sampling themselves. METHOD(S): Our study was conducted using the Community Based Participatory Research framework in three ethnic communities in Miami-Dade County: Hispanic, Haitian and one mixed. Each of three trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) recruited 200 women aged 30-65 years from various community-based locations and scheduled a subsequent 30-min assessment. Women were randomized to one of three arms; 1) culturally tailored health education materials 2) an individualized 60 min CHW led health education session followed by CHW navigation to a particpating health center for a Pap Smear 3) Individualized health education and the option of having HPV home selfsampling or CHW navigation for a Pap smear at a health center. Our primary outcome was self-report of having cervical cancer screening assessed at 6 months after the initial evaluation done by a research assitant blinded to allocation status. Women lost to followup were considered as not screened. At study exit, all women not having had screening were offered HPV self-sampling. RESULT(S): We assessed 4608 women of whom 1156 were study eligible. Having had a Pap smear in the last 3 years (51 %) and age (15 %) were the primary reasons for study ineligibility. We were unable to schedule an initial baseline assessment with 38% of study eligible women and 11 % declined to participate. Among the 601 women randomized, mean age was 47+9 years, 67% had household incomes under \$20,000, and 76% lacked health insurance. These characteristics and loss to follow-up at 6 months (9-12 %) were similar across all three arms. Using intention to treat, at 6 months 29 % of women randomized to health education reported being screened for cervical cancer versus 38 % in the CHW navigation group and 73 % in the HPV sampling group (P\textless0.05 for group 2 versus group 1, and \textless0.01 for group 3 versus group 2 or 1. In pre-planned subgroup analysis, in one community (mixed) where barriers to traditional pap smears screening were minimized, rates of screening were more attenuated in groups 2 versus 3, 58 and 73 %, respectively as compared to 27 % in group 1 (p\textless.0.01 for all three comparisons). Rates of HPV positivity were highest in the Haitian community 25 % versus 10 % and 13 % in the other two locations (p\textless.05). CHWs were able to confirm follow-up and treatment (when needed) in over 90 % women having an abnormal screen. CONCLUSION(S): We found that among a sample of immigrant predominantly low income and uninsured women, HPV self sampling was considerably superior to health education and CHW navigation to achieve cervical cancer screening. Our findings lend strong support for this screening strategy among hard to reach minority populations.},
