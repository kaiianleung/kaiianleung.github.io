abstract: 'Background In the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated
  questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine
  among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally
  adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.Methods The 5C scale was
  translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently
  translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final
  Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries
  (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic
  speaking adults (aged textgreater=18 years) were included in the final analysis.
  Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried
  out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.Results Age of participants
  ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from
  UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met
  the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha textgreater=0.7). Convergent
  validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation
  (P&lt;0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix
  (&lt;0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire
  could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that
  the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with
  adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924,
  CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 &amp; NFI=906).Conclusion the Arabic version of
  the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents
  of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors
