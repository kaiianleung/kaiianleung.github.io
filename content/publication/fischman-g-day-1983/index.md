abstract: This article describes how a hospital-based Community Mental Health Centre
  in California, United States, addressed the problem of underutilization by its Spanish-speaking
  population. The authors present a clinical program model which can be duplicated
  without hiring large numbers of bilingual professionals. The program offers a comprehensive
  range of psychiatric treatment services to a particular minority population, and
  can be readily adapted to deliver mental health care to any national minority or
  ethnic subpopulation. All of the services for the Spanish-speaking seek to promote
  community integration, and are designed to provide therapeutic experiences in a
  foreign environment while maintaining cultural ties.
