abstract: "BACKGROUND: Research indicates that fear of immigration enforcement among
  Latinos in North Carolina results in limited access to and utilization of health
  services and negative health consequences. This project developed recommendations
  to mitigate the public health impact of immigration enforcement policies in North
  Carolina., METHODS: Our community-based participatory research partnership conducted
  6 Spanish-language report-backs (an approach to sharing, validating, and interpreting
  data) and 3 bilingual forums with community members and public health leaders throughout
  North Carolina. The goals of these events were to discuss the impact of immigration
  enforcement on Latino health and develop recommendations to increase health services
  access and utilization. Findings from the report-backs and forums were analyzed
  using grounded theory to identify and refine common recommendations., RESULTS: A
  total of 344 people participated in the report-backs and forums. Eight recommendations
  emerged: increase knowledge among Latinos about local health services; build capacity
  to promote policy changes; implement system-level changes among organizations providing
  health services; train lay health advisors to help community members navigate systems;
  share Latinos' experiences with policy makers; reduce transportation barriers; increase
  schools' support of Latino families; and increase collaboration among community
  members, organizations, health care providers, and academic researchers., LIMITATIONS:
  Representatives from 16 of 100 North Carolina counties participated. These 16 counties
  represent geographically diverse regions, and many of these counties have large
  Latino populations., CONCLUSIONS: Immigration enforcement is a public health issue.
  Participants proposed developing new partnerships, identifying strategies, and implementing
  action steps for carrying out recommendations to reduce negative health outcomes
  among Latinos in North Carolina.Copyright Â©2016 by the North Carolina Institute
