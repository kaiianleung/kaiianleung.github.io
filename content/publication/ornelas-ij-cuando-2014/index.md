abstract: 'Purpose: Research suggests that Latino immigrant men face many difficulties
  in adapting to life in the United States, and previous studies suggest that heavy
  alcohol use is one coping mechanismin response. The aim of this study was to understand
  the use and context for use of alcohol among Latino immigrantmen to identify intervention
  opportunities to reduce heavy alcohol use in this population. Method(s): Our study
  used a sequential mixed methods approach. In the qualitative phase, Latino immigrant
  men (N=27) who were current drinkers were recruited fromcommunity-based organizations
  to participate in focus groups and semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Data were
  collected in Spanish by trained bilingual research staff. Transcripts were coded
  and analyzed in Atlas.ti.We then recruited Latino immigrant men (N=104) from a community-based
  organization to complete an interviewer-administered survey regarding their alcohol
  use.Measures included: 14-day Timeline Followback, Short Inventory of Problems,
  Discrimination, and Acculturation Stress. Descriptive analyses were used to identify
  patterns of alcohol use and social factors associated with unhealthy drinking. Result(s):
  Both qualitative and quantitative data showed patterns of frequent drinking, including
  binge drinking at least once a week were common. Men were more likely to drink when
  feeling lonely, socially isolated, and guilty about being away from their families.
  Stressors such as language barriers and discrimination were also associated with
  unhealthy drinking. Drinking helped men feel more strong, confident, friendly and
  conversational. Negative consequences of drinking included strained family relationships,
  poor work performance, and job loss. Some men reported readiness to change their
  drinking, but had little support in their social networks and primarily coped with
  problems alone. Over a quarter of themen had previously sought help with their drinking
  through their church or Alcoholics Anonymous. Over half the men were interested
  in counseling to help them drink less. Conclusion(s): Unhealthy drinking and negative
  consequences were common in both community samples of Latino immigrant men. Social
  factors such as discrimination and lack of access to alcohol prevention and treatment
  programs contribute to these patterns. As such, community-based interventions may
  help reduce heavy alcohol use in this vulnerable population.'
