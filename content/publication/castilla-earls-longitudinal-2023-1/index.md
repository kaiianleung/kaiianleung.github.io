abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine changes in English and Spanish morphosyntactic
  standardized scores over time in bilingual children., METHOD: One hundred bilingual
  children participated in this longitudinal study. The average age of the children
  at the beginning of the study was 5;11 (years;months). A subset of the participants
  was identified as children with developmental language disorder (DLD, n = 43). Children
  completed behavioral testing in Spanish and English at three time points over a
  period of 2 years. Growth curve modeling was employed to analyze longitudinal data.,
  RESULTS: Distinct patterns of Spanish and English language growth were observed.
  While the average standard score in English increased, the average score in Spanish
  decreased over time for both groups. Children with DLD showed persistent language
  difficulties in both Spanish and English over time in comparison to their peers.,
  CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence of a shift in language proficiency
  from Spanish to English for bilingual children with and without language disorders.
  This study also shows that bilingual children with DLD show a protracted but parallel
  growth in morphosyntactic skills in comparison to children without DLD., SUPPLEMENTAL
