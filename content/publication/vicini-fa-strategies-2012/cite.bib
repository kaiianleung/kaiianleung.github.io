 abstract = {Objectives: We studied the feasibility of implementing a community-based participatory process (CBPP) that addressed cancer education, prevention, and screening in 2 ethnic minority populations by evaluating the improvement in rates of cancer screening compared with historical benchmarks. Method(s): From 2003 to 2009, 2281 community members participated in CBPPs conducted by the Beaumont Cancer Institute in cooperation with the Arab American and Chaldean (AAC) Council, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. The study population consisted of 1067 individuals who completed a postcancer forum survey: 642 from the African American (AA) and 425 from the AAC forums. Data were collected on participants' screening history and participation in subsequent screening tests after the previous year's CBPP. Result(s): Following attendance of at least one cancer forum the previous year, 329 (30.8%) of the 1067 participant respondents underwent some type of cancer screening, 32% in the AA forums and 28.9% in the AAC forums. Compared with published controls, the CBPPs led to a 38.6% increase in mammographic screening and a 28.7% increase in prostate-specific antigen screening; the AA cohort had 39.7% and 28.4% increases whereas the AAC cohort had 36.3% and 28.9% increases in mammographic and prostate-specific antigen screening, respectively. Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that implementing CBPPs are feasible in underscreened ethnic minority populations. Further studies need to be performed to determine the absolute benefit of CBPPs compared with baseline levels of screening within these ethnic minority populations.
