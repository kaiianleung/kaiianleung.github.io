abstract: 'Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and preliminary
  effects of a culturally grounded, community-based diabetes prevention program among
  obese Latino adolescents. Method(s): Fifteen obese Latino adolescents (body mass
  index [BMI] percentile = 96.3 +/- 1.1, age = 15.0 +/- 0.9 years) completed a 12-week
  intervention that included weekly lifestyle education classes delivered by bilingual/bicultural
  promotoras and three, 60-minute physical activity sessions per week. Participants
  were assessed for anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference),
  cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity/inactivity, nutrition behaviors, and
  insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
  Result(s): The intervention resulted in significant decreases in BMI z score, BMI
  percentile, and waist circumference; increases in cardiorespiratory fitness; and
  decreases in physical inactivity and dietary fat consumption. In addition to these
  changes, the intervention led to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity
  and reductions in 2-hour glucose levels. Conclusion(s): These results support the
  feasibility and efficacy of a community-based diabetes prevention program for high-risk
  Latino youth. Translational approaches that are both culturally grounded and biologically
  meaningful represent a novel and innovative strategy for closing the obesity-related
  health disparities gap. Â© 2012 The Author(s).'
