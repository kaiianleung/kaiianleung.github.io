abstract: Unlike regions with larger Latino populations, the health care infrastructure
  in Cincinnati does not include linguistically and culturally appropriate services
  to meet the need of the growing Latino immigrant community. In order to guide development
  of appropriate health care services, a team of academic and community researchers
  collaborated on a community- based participatory research project to understand
  health care use, barriers to health care, perceptions of health care, and health
  care needs of Latino immigrants. Co- researchers administered 518 surveys and conducted
  focus groups with 34 Latino immigrants. Participants relied on community clinics
  for care more often than is seen in nationwide Hispanic samples. Results revealed
  significant health care barriers, which Latino immigrants attribute to language,
  lack of quality interpreters, documentation status, and discrimination. Results
  suggest that the dearth of established social support networks and health care infrastructure
  in new Latino growth areas exacerbate the health care obstacles experienced by Latino
  immigrants throughout the country.
