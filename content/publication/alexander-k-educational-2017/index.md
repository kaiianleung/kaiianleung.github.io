abstract: 'Introduction: In addition to the ageing of the population, the United States
  faces a significant sociodemographic challenge: The growth in the number of minorities.
  Minorities and older adults are particularly vulnerable to receiving suboptimal
  healthcare. Method(s): In collaboration with community organizations and a Federal
  government grant through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),
  the Geriatric Resource Interprofessional Program (GRIP) was set up at Memorial Sloan
  Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). It spearheaded an educational initiative on cognitive
  dysfunction targeting minority communities in Queens County. Four sessions were
  conducted at community centers. An additional session was conducted to address the
  needs of caregivers of older adults with dementias. Consecutive interpretation of
  the lectures was performed to the predominant language of the group. Two sessions
  discussing the assessment and management of cognitive syndromes in older cancer
  patients were delivered to clinical staff at regional locations of MSKCC. Result(s):
  A total of 171 people who spoke 15 different primary languages attended the community
  sessions. Their median age was 66 (28-99 years) and 65% were women. 53% were born
  in Bangladesh, the rest in 16 other countries. 34 providers-nurses, case managers,
  social workers and oncologists attended the two clinical sessions. Their median
  age was 57.5 (31-73 years). 90% were female (N=31) and 82% identified as white (N=28).
  Conclusion(s): Challenges to the initiative included differences in literacy, multiple
  cultures and languages. Successes and barriers faced in implementing the educational
  initiative, as well as pre and post-test results will be presented.'
