 abstract = {Objectives: To develop an educational video to reach elderly Latinos in order to improve understanding and encourage evaluation of cognitive changes by 1) using focus groups to identify dementia knowledge gaps, health communication preferences and trusted advisors for health concerns; 2) collaborating with elderly Latino community members to create a video; and 3) collecting survey data regarding community response to the video. Design(s): Grounded theory qualitative approach using focus groups; collaborative community based model to create the video and anonymous survey at community screenings. Setting(s): Community senior centers in East Harlem, New York. Participant(s): A team of low-income mono and bilingual elderly Latino community residents, researchers, clinicians, and a film professional.Measurements: Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts; three item survey. Result(s): A collaboratively produced video and initial assessment in 49 Latino elders that indicated the video had a positive effect on interest in obtaining a brief memory screening at outreach events (71%). Conclusion(s): The project demonstrates the feasibility of this interdisciplinary partnership to create a culturally and linguistically sensitive video to promote service use concerning memory loss and cognitive evaluations among elderly Latinos. Initial survey results suggested a positive response and an increase in interest in memory screening.Copyright © 2018 International Psychogeriatric Association.},
