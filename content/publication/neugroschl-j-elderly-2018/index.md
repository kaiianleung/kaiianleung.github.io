abstract: 'Objectives: To develop an educational video to reach elderly Latinos in
  order to improve understanding and encourage evaluation of cognitive changes by
  1) using focus groups to identify dementia knowledge gaps, health communication
  preferences and trusted advisors for health concerns; 2) collaborating with elderly
  Latino community members to create a video; and 3) collecting survey data regarding
  community response to the video. Design(s): Grounded theory qualitative approach
  using focus groups; collaborative community based model to create the video and
  anonymous survey at community screenings. Setting(s): Community senior centers in
  East Harlem, New York. Participant(s): A team of low-income mono and bilingual elderly
  Latino community residents, researchers, clinicians, and a film professional.Measurements:
  Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts; three item survey. Result(s): A collaboratively
  produced video and initial assessment in 49 Latino elders that indicated the video
  had a positive effect on interest in obtaining a brief memory screening at outreach
  events (71%). Conclusion(s): The project demonstrates the feasibility of this interdisciplinary
  partnership to create a culturally and linguistically sensitive video to promote
  service use concerning memory loss and cognitive evaluations among elderly Latinos.
  Initial survey results suggested a positive response and an increase in interest
  in memory screening.Copyright Â© 2018 International Psychogeriatric Association.'
