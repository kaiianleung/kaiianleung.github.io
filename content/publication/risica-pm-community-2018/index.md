abstract: 'Purpose: and Objectives: The risk of diseases associated with Metabolic
  Syndrome (MetS) is higher for Hispanics living in the northeastern United States
  than for other racial and ethnic groups. Higher risk of diabetes, high blood lipids,
  obesity and limited access to continuity of care are all factors that also contribute
  to disproportionately poorer chronic disease outcomes for Hispanics. Intervention
  approach: This article describes the planning and implementation of, and evaluation
  plans for the Vida Sana Program (VSP), a community-based group intervention created
  to address the identified MetS risks by encouraging healthier diet and physical
  activity behaviors among a low-income, largely Spanish speaking, and literacy limited
  uninsured population. Developed in response to recent calls for culturally-tailored
  interventions, VSP is conducted by trained bicultural/bilingual Navegantes, who
  deliver a culturally sensitive, fun and engaging eight-week, in-person educational
  series through group meetings. The intervention also includes a 40-page colorful,
  picture and graphic enhanced booklet to be used in the group setting and at home.
  The intervention focused on screening for MetS-associated disease risk factors,
  understanding chronic disease management, encouraging medication adherence, increasing
  physical activity, and healthful dietary changes such as limiting alcohol, sodium,
  unhealthy fats and excess carbohydrate intake, while emphasizing portion control,
  whole grains and healthy fats. Conclusion(s): This creative, community-based approach
  fills an important gap in the community and in the public health literature, is
  well liked by health literacy limited patients, and will provide an important model
  of successfully engaging the Hispanic community on these important health issues.Copyright
