abstract: Developmental language disorder (DLD) refers to a language delay in the
  absence of other underlying causes. Individuals with DLD can also present other
  problems related to behavioral, scholarly, and emotional aspects of their daily
  lives because of their language difficulties. Moreover, these difficulties could
  be influenced by family and socioeconomic characteristics. Twenty-eight bilingual
  adolescents with and without DLD in typical schools were followed from childhood
  to adolescence. At age five, language and cognitive variables were assessed. In
  addition, language, behavior, emotional and school adjustment, and socioeconomic
  and family aspects were evaluated at age 12. Results reveal that adolescents with
  DLD show poorer school adjustment and less adaptive skills when evaluated by their
  tutors, and a larger index of emotional problems when self-assessed. Moreover, family
  involvement, but not socioeconomic status (SES), emerged as a protective factor
  since it was related to behavioral, emotional, and school adjustment, a result that
  was further confirmed by structural equation modeling. Therefore, a more global
  approach involving individuals, schools and families is needed to provide adolescents
  with DLD adequate support. It is important to stimulate their social skills and
  emotional adjustment so they can cope with social difficulties more easily, especially
  at school.
