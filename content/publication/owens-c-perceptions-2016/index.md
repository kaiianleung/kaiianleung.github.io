abstract: 'Background: Equality of care in pregnancy is important for all women, however
  can be difficult for healthcare providers to achieve. It has been found that culturally
  and linguistically diverse women born overseas generally have lower satisfaction
  with pregnancy care than women born in the host country. Aim(s): Using a phenomenological
  framework, and models of care as a conceptual framework, this study explored the
  perceptions of care experienced by refugees and migrant women of culturally and
  linguistically diverse backgrounds who had participated in a community-based antenatal
  programme specialising in maternity care of multicultural women. Method(s): Informants
  were twelve women aged between 23 and 44 years of age; one woman was 33 weeks pregnant,
  other women had given birth in the six months prior to data collection. Semi-structured
  interviews were conducted, using interpreters for women who spoke little or no English.
  Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Finding(s): Four main themes were identified;
  Social Support, Gaining of Knowledge, A Holistic Service, and New Opportunities.
  Conclusion(s): Using a community-based antenatal service specialising in maternity
  care of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds enabled the
  needs of refugee and migrant women to be recognised and met, and therefore enhanced
  their perception of the pregnancy experience.Copyright Â© 2015 Australian College
