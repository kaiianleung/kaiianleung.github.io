abstract: "Background: Access and adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines
  is challenging for women with language, cultural, and financial barriers. We partnered
  with several community sites in the City of Milwaukee, the mobile mammography coach,
  and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program (WWWP). We organized monthly, small group workshops
  with the help of a multi-lingual navigator, community health workers, and translators.
  The 12-month program provided delivery of mammograms through the mobile coach, free
  to eligible women textgreater 45 years. Method(s): We administered survey evaluations,
  demographic surveys, and pre- and post-tests of breast cancer knowledge. Descriptive
  statistics, test for proportions and McNemar's test were used to summarize and analyze
  the results. Qualitative answers reflecting barriers are also summarized. Result(s):
  195 women of several ethnicities (mean age 44) attended the workshops: 49% were
  textgreater= 45 years old and 45% insured. Among the insured, a higher proportion
  of women reported prior screening mammography, while fewer women had no screening
  due to multiple barriers. Several women (both insured and uninsured) suffered from
  language barriers, fear of disease, transportation, and religious beliefs; these
  were addressed in small group-focused sessions. Under WWWP guidelines, 28 women
  were eligible for the free mammogram. Surveys of breast health knowledge showed
  significant improvement from pre- to postworkshop. Conclusion(s): Our community-academic
  partnership model provided culturallytailored breast health education with the help
  of multilingual staff members. Adherence to screening mammography is heavily influenced
  by, but does not entirely depend upon, insurance status and indicates a greater
  need for culturally competent breast health education for women with multiple barriers."
