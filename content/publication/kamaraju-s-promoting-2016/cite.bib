 abstract = {Background: Access and adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines is challenging for women with language, cultural, and financial barriers. We partnered with several community sites in the City of Milwaukee, the mobile mammography coach, and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program (WWWP). We organized monthly, small group workshops with the help of a multi-lingual navigator, community health workers, and translators. The 12-month program provided delivery of mammograms through the mobile coach, free to eligible women \textgreater 45 years. Method(s): We administered survey evaluations, demographic surveys, and pre- and post-tests of breast cancer knowledge. Descriptive statistics, test for proportions and McNemar's test were used to summarize and analyze the results. Qualitative answers reflecting barriers are also summarized. Result(s): 195 women of several ethnicities (mean age 44) attended the workshops: 49% were \textgreater= 45 years old and 45% insured. Among the insured, a higher proportion of women reported prior screening mammography, while fewer women had no screening due to multiple barriers. Several women (both insured and uninsured) suffered from language barriers, fear of disease, transportation, and religious beliefs; these were addressed in small group-focused sessions. Under WWWP guidelines, 28 women were eligible for the free mammogram. Surveys of breast health knowledge showed significant improvement from pre- to postworkshop. Conclusion(s): Our community-academic partnership model provided culturallytailored breast health education with the help of multilingual staff members. Adherence to screening mammography is heavily influenced by, but does not entirely depend upon, insurance status and indicates a greater need for culturally competent breast health education for women with multiple barriers.},
