abstract: "Little is known about the immigrant Latino/a transgender community in the
  southeastern United States. This study used photovoice, a methodology aligned with
  community-based participatory research, to explore needs, assets, and priorities
  of Latina transgender women in North Carolina. Nine immigrant Latina male-to-female
  transgender women documented their daily experiences through photography, engaged
  in empowerment-based photo-discussions, and organized a bilingual community forum
  to move knowledge to action. From the participants' photographs and words, 11 themes
  emerged in three domains: daily challenges (e.g., health risks, uncertainty about
  the future, discrimination, and anxiety about family reactions); needs and priorities
  (e.g., health and social services, emotional support, and collective action); and
  community strengths and assets (e.g., supportive individuals and institutions, wisdom
  through lived experiences, and personal and professional goals). At the community
  forum, 60 influential advocates, including Latina transgender women, representatives
  from community-based organizations, health and social service providers, and law
  enforcement, reviewed findings and identified ten recommended actions. Overall,
  photovoice served to obtain rich qualitative insight into the lived experiences
  of Latina transgender women that was then shared with local leaders and agencies
  to help address priorities."
