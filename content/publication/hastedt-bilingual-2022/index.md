abstract: Parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) express
  concern about raising their children bilingually, and often hear advice from professionals
  against the use of bilingualism. The current study examined the relation between
  bilingualism and the language and social communication skills of toddlers diagnosed
  with ASD (N = 353) in the US, while controlling for socioeconomic risk factors.
  Structural equation modeling showed no differences in language skills between bilingual
  Spanish-English speaking children and monolingual English-speaking (p = .596) or
  monolingual Spanish-speaking (p = .963) children and showed a bilingual advantage
  on socialization skills when comparing bilingual and monolingual English-speaking
  children (p = .001). Parents of autistic children exposed to Spanish and English
  should be encouraged to raise their child bilingually if it best suits familial
  needs. Copyright Â© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business
