abstract: Research shows that social support is essential for healthy psychological
  functioning. Help seeking and social support are soc ial processes shaped by cultural
  understandings about how need should be expressed, to whom, and in what circumstances.
  This study used grounded theory methodology to examine how cultural factors regulate
  help seeking and social support in a sample of 25 Japanese sojourners' wives living
  in America. Culturally based social edicts such as mutual responsibility and in-group
  solidarity were found to promote help seeking and social support. In contrast, culturally
  specific factors such as enryo (polite deference) hierarchy, and the cultural rules
  governing reciprocity inhibited these behaviors. From these data, a cultural model
  of social exchange allowing for cultural diversity, is proposed. This model can
  increase the effectiveness of nursing interventions aimed at community-based health
  promotion.
