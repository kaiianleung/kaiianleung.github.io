abstract: 'Introduction: Gestational diabetes and overweight during pregnancy are
  associated with future type 2 diabetes. Postpartum weight loss can reduce diabetes
  risk. However, effective interventions for postpartum weight loss are lacking, in
  particular for Latina populations, despite their disproportionate burdens of gestational
  diabetes, overweight, and diabetes. Study design: This was a community-based RCT.
  Setting/participants: Researchers recruited pregnant individuals with gestational
  diabetes or BMItextgreater25 kg/m2 from safety-net health care settings and Women,
  Infants, and Children offices in Northern California in 2014-2018. Of 180 individuals
  randomized to intervention (n=89) or control (n=91), 78% identified as Latina, 61%
  were primarily Spanish speaking, and 76% perceived their diabetes risk to be low.
  Intervention(s): The intervention consisted of a 5-month postpartum telephone-based
  health coaching intervention delivered in English or Spanish. Main Outcome Measure(s):
  Data were collected through surveys at enrollment and 9-12 months after delivery
  and chart review up to 12 months after delivery. The primary outcome, weight change
  from prepregnancy to 9-12 months after delivery, was compared between the groups,
  overall and within strata defined a priori according to language (Spanish or English)
  and diabetes risk perception (none/slight or moderate/high). Result(s): The intent-to-treat
  estimated intervention effect was +0.7 kg (95% CI= -2.4 kg, +3.8 kg; p=0.67). In
  stratified analyses, intervention effects remained nonsignificant but varied in
  direction: effects were favorable among English speakers and those with higher perceived
  diabetes risk, and unfavorable among Spanish speakers and those with lower perceived
  risk. Analyses were conducted in 2021-2022. Conclusion(s): A postpartum health coaching
  intervention, designed for low-income Latina women at increased risk for diabetes,
  did not reduce postpartum weight gain. Intervention effects were nonsignificantly
  more favorable among English speakers versus Spanish speakers, and among those who
  perceived their diabetes risk to be high versus low. Trial registration: This study
  is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02240420.Copyright Â© 2023'
