abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Childhood marks the highest risk for allergic sensitization
  to asthma triggers. Hispanic/Latino children are at higher risk for hospitalization
  for asthma than non-Hispanic White children. Childcare providers lack knowledge
  about reducing asthma triggers. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this paper is to describe
  a community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative aimed at developing and
  pilot testing a bilingual walk-through assessment tool for asthma-friendly childcare
  environments. METHOD(S): Ten Latina mothers of children with asthma living in the
  Pacific Northwest collaborated with research partners to develop and pilot test
  a Childcare Environmental Health (CEH) assessment walk-through survey.Results and
  Lessons Learned: The women innovated the survey with photography and structural
  examinations of stress and provision of basic needs. The survey tool identified
  environmental threats to asthma in all three childcares surveyed. CONCLUSION(S):
  Parents are well-positioned to build trust with childcare providers, assess asthma
  triggers, and recommend practical mitigation strategies.'
