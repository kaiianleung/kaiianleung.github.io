abstract: In 1998, community leaders prompted members of the Black and Hispanic Congressional
  Caucuses to urge President Clinton to declare HIV/AIDS a crisis in the African American
  and Latino communities; their advocacy resulted in the formation of the Minority
  AIDS Initiative. As part of this initiative, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention
  (CSAP) of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency funded the Substance
  Abuse and HIV Prevention Youth and Women of Color Initiative (CSAP Initiative).
  The CSAP Initiative is the first major federal effort to develop community-based
  integrated HIV and substance abuse prevention approaches targeting racial/ethnic
  populations that have been disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. This article
  describes the current state of HIV prevention research involving racial/ethnic minority
  populations and the current status of the CSAP Initiative. The data collected through
  the CSAP Initiative, implemented by 47 community organizations, will help to fill
  the existing knowledge gap about how to best prevent HIV in these communities. This
  data collection effort is an unparalleled opportunity to learn about risk and protective
  factors, including contextual factors, that are critical to the prevention of HIV/AIDS
  in African American, Latino, and other racial/ethnic minority communities but that
  are often not investigated.
