abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The international liver glycogen storage disease (GSD) priority
  setting partnership (IGSDPSP) was established to identify the top research priorities
  in this area. METHOD(S): The multiphase methodology followed the principles of the
  James Lind Alliance (JLA) guidebook. An international scoping survey in seven languages
  was distributed to patients, carers and healthcare professionals to gather uncertainties,
  which were consolidated into summary questions. The existing literature was reviewed
  to ensure that the summary questions had not yet been answered. A second survey
  asked responders to prioritize these summary questions. A final shortlist of 22
  questions was discussed during an international multi-stakeholder workshop, and
  a consensus was reached on the top 11 priorities using an adapted nominal group
  technique. RESULT(S): In the first survey, a total of 1388 questions were identified
  from 763 responders from 58 countries. These original uncertainties were refined
  into 72 summary questions for a second prioritization survey. In total 562 responders
  from 58 countries answered the second survey. From the second survey, the top 10
  for patients, carers and healthcare professionals was identified and this shortlist
  of 22 questions was taken to the final workshop. During the final workshop participants
  identified the worldwide top 11 research priorities for liver GSD. In addition,
  a top 3 research priorities per liver GSD subtype was identified. CONCLUSION(S):
  This unique priority setting partnership is the first international, multilingual
  priority setting partnership focusing on ultra-rare diseases. This process provides
  a valuable resource for researchers and funding agencies to foster interdisciplinary
  and transnational research projects with a clear benefit for patients. This article
