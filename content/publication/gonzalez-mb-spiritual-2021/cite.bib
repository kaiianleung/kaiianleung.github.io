 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand how Indigenous language and spirituality revitalization efforts may affect mental health within Indigenous communities. Although Indigenous communities experience disproportionate rates of mental health problems, research supporting language and spirituality's role in improving mental health is under-researched and poorly understood. METHOD(S): Data for this study are from a Community-based Participatory Research Project involving five Anishinaabe tribes in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Participants were sampled from clinic records of adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, living on or near the reservation, and self-identifying as American Indian (mean age = 46.3; n = 191). RESULT(S): Structural equation modeling illustrates that language use in the home is associated with positive mental health through spiritual connectedness. CONCLUSION(S): Results support tribal community expressions of the positive effects of cultural involvement for Indigenous wellbeing, and improve what is known about the interconnectedness of language and spirituality.
