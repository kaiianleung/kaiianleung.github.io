abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand how Indigenous
  language and spirituality revitalization efforts may affect mental health within
  Indigenous communities. Although Indigenous communities experience disproportionate
  rates of mental health problems, research supporting language and spirituality's
  role in improving mental health is under-researched and poorly understood. METHOD(S):
  Data for this study are from a Community-based Participatory Research Project involving
  five Anishinaabe tribes in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Participants were sampled from
  clinic records of adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, living on or near
  the reservation, and self-identifying as American Indian (mean age = 46.3; n = 191).
  RESULT(S): Structural equation modeling illustrates that language use in the home
  is associated with positive mental health through spiritual connectedness. CONCLUSION(S):
  Results support tribal community expressions of the positive effects of cultural
  involvement for Indigenous wellbeing, and improve what is known about the interconnectedness
  of language and spirituality. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights
