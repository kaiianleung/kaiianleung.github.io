abstract: "Preterm infants are at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, especially
  language delay. Preterm infants textless 29 weeks' gestational age, cared for in
  Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network affiliated hospitals, were assessed between
  18 to 21 months corrected age using the Bayley-III. Bayley-III Language Composite
  Scores were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses for children in
  three primary language groups: English, French and other. 6146 children were included.
  The primary language at home was English, French or another language for 3708 children
  (60%), 1312 children (21%) and 1126 children (18%), respectively, and overall, 44%
  were exposed to two or more languages at home. Univariate analysis showed that primary
  language was associated with lower Bayley-III Language scores; however, multivariate
  analyses demonstrated that neither primary language nor language of administration
  were significantly associated with lower language scores when adjusted for gestational
  age, other developmental delays and sociodemographic factors, but multiple language
  exposure was. Sociodemographic and other factors are more important in determining
  language development than primary language at home. Further studies are needed to
  examine the association between exposure to multiple languages and lower Bayley-III
  language scores in preterm infants."
