abstract: 'Morphological knowledge is known to be positively associated with reading
  ability. However, whether morphological knowledge affects children’s learning of
  new orthographic representations is less clear. Purpose: This study aims to investigate
  morphological effects on orthographic learning, and whether this effect, if any,
  is different for monolingual compared to Chinese-English-speaking bilingual children,
  who often have difficulty acquiring English morphology.Method: A total of 59 Year
  2 children, including 29 English-speaking monolinguals and 30 Chinese-English-speaking
  bilinguals participated. We assessed children’s pre-existing inflectional morphological
  knowledge. The children learned twelve novel words that were either presented with
  morphological variation (e.g., vack, vacks, vacking, vacked) or pure repetition
  (e.g., vack x 4). Orthographic learning was measured by orthographic choice and
  spelling tasks. Results: 1) the monolinguals had better inflectional morphological
  knowledge than the bilinguals; 2) there were no differences in orthographic learning
  between the monolinguals and bilinguals; 3) orthographic learning was better in
  the repetition condition, but only evident in the spelling task. Conclusion: Chinese-English-speaking
  bilinguals’ weaker morphological knowledge does not seem to hinder their orthographic
  learning ability. We also provide initial evidence that novel written words are
  learned better when they are presented without morphological variation, supporting
  the item-based feature of the self-teaching hypothesis.'
