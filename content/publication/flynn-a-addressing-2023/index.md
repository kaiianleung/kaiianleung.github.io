abstract: "Introduction/Aim: Social factors contribute significantly to asthma burden.
  This is particularly true for CALD groups where non-medical factors negatively impact
  their health. Improving health requires addressing systems issues based on understanding
  connections between social, culture and health domains. Method(s): This ethnographic
  participatory design project entailed (1) training of bi-cultural workers from three
  cultural groups as research assistants to discover the barriers and enablers to
  their communities' health ('systems maps'), (2) a structured process to determine
  priority audience 'readiness', and therefore selection, and (3) co-design of solutions
  with the priority audience. Results were analysed using a mixed methods approach
  focusing on relevance and appropriateness, effectiveness and acceptability, sustainability
  and acceptability, and efficiency. Efficiency was evaluated by a 'social return
  on investment' (SROI) analysis. Result(s): The project engaged 184 community members
  and 15 community pharmacists. The system effects analysis was a critical part of
  understanding the factors contributing to illness/wellbeing, and this was validated
  by the respective communities in follow up debriefing sessions. It demonstrated
  that culture is more important than condition for these groups in determining health
  impacts. The Arabic speaking community was considered most ready to participate
  in solution design and implementation. The selected community pharmacy intervention
  focused on cultural competence and included an interactive session between pharmacy
  and community on the basics of chronic disease. 97% of Arabic speakers agreed that
  the session helped their understanding of the role of community pharmacy in their
  health. 92% agreed that the session instilled trust. The SROI was estimated to be
  $0.7. Conclusion(s): Systems mapping is an effective tool to identify issues that
  influence health outcomes. Codesigned health interventions that address these issues
  are likely to be both successful and impactful among culturally diverse communities.
  Conversely, interventions which are naive of the systems influences of diverse communities
  are prone to failure."
