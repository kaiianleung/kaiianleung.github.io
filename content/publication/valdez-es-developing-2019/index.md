abstract: 'BACKGROUND: U.S.-Mexico border communities bear a disproportionate burden
  of adolescent pregnancy. Binational community-based participatory research (CBPR)
  partnerships can help to remediate identified health disparities. OBJECTIVE(S):
  The purpose of this article is to share the experiences and lessons learned from
  the development of a binational CBPR partnership. METHOD(S): Mexican and U.S. academics,
  community members, and promotoras used the Community Community-Campus Partnerships
  for Health (CCPH) Guiding Principles of Partnership to form a binational CBPR partnership
  to remediate adolescent pregnancy on the U.S.-Mexico border. LESSONS LEARNED: We
  learned how to use existing networks to form the partnership and leverage resources
  to address an existing health disparity. We learned the importance of engaging in
  effective communication with partners and the necessity of flexibility when working
  within a different governmental culture. We learned how to leverage critical partnerships
  to bridge national, cultural, and linguistic differences to conduct binational partnership
  research, and to be responsive to unforeseen situations when working in low-resource
  communities.'
