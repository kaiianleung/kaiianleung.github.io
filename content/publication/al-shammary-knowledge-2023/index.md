abstract: Promoting stem cell donation behaviors could be crucial in advancing stem
  cell-based treatment, research and improving public health in Saudi Arabia. Donation
  of stem cells can be considered an act of social welfare just like blood donation
  because stem-cell-based therapies are emerging as a hope for those suffering from
  chronic health conditions and/or terminal illnesses.
