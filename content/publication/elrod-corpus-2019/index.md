abstract: Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness,
  affecting all races and ethnicities, and with symptoms typically beginning in adolescence
  and early adulthood. Still, little is known about the language markers of mental
  health for materials written in Spanish. This study collected pro-anorexia (pro-ana)
  public Tumblr blog posts written in Spanish and analyzed their content using Linguistic
  Inquiry and Word Count software. Pro-ana-specific words, pronoun use, and psychological
  linguistic properties were analyzed, and results indicated that reasons for anorexia
  was the most frequently occurring category within pro-ana posts. Words in this category
  were associated with intense and negative emotions commonly found in trauma narratives
  in the dominant language (Spanish). Usersâ€™ pronoun use suggested an increased focus
  on people and objects, which has been linked to decreased likelihood of recovery.
  The psychological properties of the posts had a negative emotional tone and were
  marked by significant use of ingestion and health words, signaling the symptoms
  of anorexia. This research points to benefits in assessing bilingual clients for
  anorexia behaviors, symptoms, and online-posting behaviors, while also revealing
  the need for improved evidence-based treatment for trauma in bilingual individuals,
  as well as the need for Spanish and code-switching blog norms to inform and advance
  future research.
