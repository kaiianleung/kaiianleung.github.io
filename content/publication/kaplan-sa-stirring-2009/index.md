abstract: This case study provides a mid-course assessment of the Bronx Health REACH
  faith-based initiative four years into its implementation. The study uses qualitative
  methods to identify lessons learned and to reflect on the benefits and challenges
  of using a community-based participatory approach for the development and evaluation
  of a faith- based program designed to address health disparities. Key findings concern
  the role of pastoral leadership, the importance of providing a religious context
  for health promotion and health equality messages, the challenges of creating a
  bilingual/bi-cultural program, and the need to provide management support to the
  lay program coordinators. The study also identifies lessons learned about community-based
  evaluation and the importance of addressing community concern about the balance
  between evaluation and program. Finally, the study identifies the challenges that
  lie ahead, including issues of program institutionalization and sustainability.
