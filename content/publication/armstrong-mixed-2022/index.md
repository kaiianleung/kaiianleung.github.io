abstract: As of 2019, men who have sex with men (MSM) in Canada are ineligible to
  donate blood if they have had oral or anal sex with another man in the last 3 months.
  Deferral policies targeting MSM are largely interpreted as unjust by gay, bisexual,
  and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) – shaping their desire to donate blood
  and engage with blood operators. This mixed methods study explores interest in blood
  donation among GBMSM as well as willingness (and eligibility) to donate under four
  different deferral policies.
