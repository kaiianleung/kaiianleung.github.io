abstract: 'Background: In order to provide effective primary care for refugees and
  to develop interventions tailored to them, we must know their needs. Little is known
  of the health needs and experiences of recently arrived refugees and other migrants
  throughout their journey through Europe. We aimed to gain insight into their health
  needs, barriers in access and wishes regarding primary health care. Method(s): In
  the spring of 2016, we conducted a qualitative, comparative case study in seven
  EU countries in a centre of first arrival, two transit centres, two intermediate-stay
  centres and two longer-stay centres using a Participatory Learning and Action research
  methodology. A total of 98 refugees and 25 healthcare workers participated in 43
  sessions. Transcripts and sessions reports were coded and thematically analyzed
  by local researchers using the same format at all sites; data were synthesized and
  further analyzed by two other researchers independently. Result(s): The main health
  problems of the participants related to war and to their harsh journey like common
  infections and psychological distress. They encountered important barriers in accessing
  healthcare: time pressure, linguistic and cultural differences and lack of continuity
  of care. They wish for compassionate, culturally sensitive healthcare workers and
  for more information on procedures and health promotion. Conclusion(s): Health of
  refugees on the move in Europe is jeopardized by their bad living circumstances
  and barriers in access to healthcare. To address their needs, healthcare workers
  have to be trained in providing integrated, compassionate and cultural competent
  healthcare.Copyright Â© The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on
