abstract: "Abstract: Faculty and staff from the University of California, San Diego
  Academic Center of Excellence on Youth Violence Prevention partnered with a local
  collaborative, the Mid-City Community Advocacy Network, to build the capacity of
  the community to identify quality of life issues and advocate for change. In an
  effort to train and mobilize community residents effectively in the skills needed
  to engage in advocacy and systems change, the traditional delivery model of community
  engagement (surveys, focus groups, large and small forums, health fairs, and street
  fairs) was replaced with culturally specific, active engagement strategies. Engaging
  diverse communities in Mid-City (Latino, Somali, and Vietnamese) required an approach
  that included hiring bilingual, bicultural staff recruited from those communities,
  hosting meetings in residents' homes, and providing extensive leadership training
  and support for residents. This community resident leadership initiative, piloted
  in the Latino community of mid-city San Diego, was successful in engaging resident
  participation in the process. This paper outlines the lessons learned from this
  initiative. Â© 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."
