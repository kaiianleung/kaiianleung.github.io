abstract: This study investigates what needs to be considered in our current health
  services to appropriately respond to abused Korean immigrant women. Using a community-based
  participatory approach, this qualitative interpretive description analyzed counseling
  documents and semi-structured interviews. Data analyses suggested that intimate
  partner violence (IPV) screening for ethnic minority women in health care settings
  can be improved by informing patients about the role of health care providers in
  addressing IPV, establishing rapport before IPV screening, assuring confidentiality
  is maintained, respecting Korean immigrant women's unique perspectives and response
  toward IPV, providing translation services, and collaborating with ethnic minority
  women's community organizations.
