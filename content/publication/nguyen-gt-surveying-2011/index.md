abstract: Southeast (SE) Asians suffer from health disparities often caused by lack
  of preventive care, exacerbated by linguistic barriers which exclude many from surveys
  that fail to include minorities. This survey of linguistically-challenged SE Asians
  captured health status indicators, behaviors and access. Items were based upon Public
  Health Management Corporation's Household Health Survey. Participants were recruited
  by a communitybased organization serving SE Asians; interviews were conducted in
  nine languages. Data were weighted to match age-sex distributions of Asians in Philadelphia.
  Of 527 interviews completed, 57% were U.S. citizens, 48% uninsured, 23% had gone
  without care due to cost. English was the main language at home for 3%, yet 53%
  reported their primary health care site did not have an interpreter. Nearly half
  reported health as fair/poor, and 22% had a chronic health condition. This community
  survey illuminates the need to profile the health care needs of these immigrant
  populations. Â© Meharry Medical College.
