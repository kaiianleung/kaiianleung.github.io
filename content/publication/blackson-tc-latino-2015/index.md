abstract: "BACKGROUND: No studies to date have assessed whether recent young adult
  (aged 18-34) Latino immigrants' biological parents' histories of substance use problems
  (BPHSUP) in their country of origin predict their alcohol use problems at pre- and
  post-immigration to the United States (US)., METHODS: BPHSUP in their country of
  origin were assessed via interviews conducted by bilingual Latino researchers with
  recent Latino immigrants primarily from Cuba and Central and South America recruited
  through respondent-driven sampling at the time of their immigration to southeastern
  US. Three waves of data were collected to document Latino immigrants' severity of
  alcohol use problems at pre-immigration and 2 annual post-immigration follow-up
  assessments. BPHSUP+/- status was used as a predictor of Latinos' (N = 452; 45.8%
  female, 54.2% male) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores at
  pre- and post-immigration with age, education, and income as covariates as wells
  as odds ratios for AUDIT classifications of hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence.,
  RESULTS: BPHSUP+ status predicted Latino immigrants' higher AUDIT scores pre- and
  post-immigration by gender (P textless .01) compared with Latino immigrants of BPHSUP-
  status, controlling for age, education, and income. BPHSUP+ status predicted odds
  ratios of 3.45 and 2.91 for AUDIT alcohol dependence classification for men and
  women, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that BPHSUP+/- status in
  their country of origin predict their young adult Latino offspring's severity of
  alcohol use problems pre- and post-immigration. These results may inform (1) community-based
  health care providers to screen recent young adult Latino immigrants for their BPHSUP+/-
  status and severity of alcohol use problems to redirect trajectories away from alcohol
  use disorders toward more normative post-immigration outcomes through culturally
  relevant prevention services and (2) future research advantages of differential
  susceptibility theory. Implications for future research and the need for replication
  studies in other geographic regions of the US are discussed."
