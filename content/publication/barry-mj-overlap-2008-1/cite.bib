 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and overlap of symptom patterns traditionally associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and incontinence among men and women in a racially and ethnically diverse, community-based population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 5506 men and women aged 30-79 years were recruited to participate in the Boston Area Community Health Survey, using a stratified-cluster sampling technique to obtain roughly similar representative samples by age group, gender and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic). Survey data were collected by bilingual interviewers in subjects' homes. Scales measuring symptom patterns were derived from validated instruments, with minor changes to eliminate different recall periods and overlap in items that might have confused subjects. RESULT(S): About a quarter of men and women of all ages met the definition for one or more of the target symptom patterns; there was no significant variation in the prevalence of any of the symptom patterns by race/ethnicity. Overall, =16% of men and women had one symptom pattern, while 7% had overlap patterns. Except for urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in both men and women, the prevalence of all symptom complexes were associated with one another significantly more often that would be expected by chance. CONCLUSION(S): Overlapping patterns of lower urinary tract symptoms and pelvic pain are common. These overlapping patterns present challenges for clinical practice and research, and require further investigation of their causes, diagnosis and optimum treatment. Â© 2007 The Authors.},
