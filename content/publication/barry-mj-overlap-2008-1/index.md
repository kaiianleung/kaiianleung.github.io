abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and overlap of symptom patterns traditionally
  associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic
  pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and incontinence
  among men and women in a racially and ethnically diverse, community-based population.
  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 5506 men and women aged 30-79 years were recruited
  to participate in the Boston Area Community Health Survey, using a stratified-cluster
  sampling technique to obtain roughly similar representative samples by age group,
  gender and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic). Survey data were collected by
  bilingual interviewers in subjects' homes. Scales measuring symptom patterns were
  derived from validated instruments, with minor changes to eliminate different recall
  periods and overlap in items that might have confused subjects. RESULT(S): About
  a quarter of men and women of all ages met the definition for one or more of the
  target symptom patterns; there was no significant variation in the prevalence of
  any of the symptom patterns by race/ethnicity. Overall, =16% of men and women had
  one symptom pattern, while 7% had overlap patterns. Except for urinary incontinence
  and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in both men and women, the prevalence
  of all symptom complexes were associated with one another significantly more often
  that would be expected by chance. CONCLUSION(S): Overlapping patterns of lower urinary
  tract symptoms and pelvic pain are common. These overlapping patterns present challenges
  for clinical practice and research, and require further investigation of their causes,
  diagnosis and optimum treatment. Â© 2007 The Authors."
