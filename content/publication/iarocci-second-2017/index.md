abstract: Parents and professionals are concerned that second language exposure may
  delay communication in children with ASD. In this study 174 youth (6-16 years) with
  and without ASD, exposed to a second language, were compared on executive function
  (EF) and functional communication (FC) with their peers without exposure. There
  were no significant differences between groups on age, IQ, and socioeconomic status.
  Parents reported on language exposure and rated EF and FC skills within everyday
  social contexts. The findings indicated that second language exposure in children
  with ASD is not associated with delay in cognitive and functional communication
  skills rather there was evidence of a reduced clinical impact as indexed by a lower
  percentage of children whose FC and EF ratings fell within the clinical range.
