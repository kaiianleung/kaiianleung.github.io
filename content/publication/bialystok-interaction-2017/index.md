abstract: One hundred and sixty-eight young adult participants were classified as
  monolingual or bilingual and as having a previously reported clinical diagnosis
  of ADHD or not to create four groups. All participants completed tests of language
  proficiency, ADHD ratings, and executive control. Both bilingualism and ADHD are
  generally associated with poorer vocabulary knowledge, but bilingualism and ADHD
  are associated with opposite effects on executive control. Consistent with this
  literature, bilinguals performed more poorly than monolinguals on the vocabulary
  test but contrary to predictions, the ADHD group performed somewhat better on language
  ability than the non-ADHD group, attesting to their high functioning status. For
  the flanker task, both bilinguals and non-ADHD participants showed less cost in
  performing in the conflict condition than in the baseline condition. For the stop-signal
  task, ADHD status interfered more with performance by bilinguals than monolinguals,
  suggesting a greater burden of ADHD on executive function for this group.
