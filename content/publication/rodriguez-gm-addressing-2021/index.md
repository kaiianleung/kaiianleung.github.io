abstract: 'Background: Cancer remains the number one cause of death among the Latino
  population despite the decrease in cancer incidence and mortality in the United
  States. Latino patients experience worse quality of life, more advanced stages of
  disease, and longer times to definitive diagnosis and treatment initiation. Yet
  there are few interventions that leverage clinical and community-based approaches
  to address these disparities. The aim of this formative qualitative study was to
  explore the specific care needs and barriers encountered by Latino patients to refine
  a community-based intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs). Method(s):
  We conducted semi-structured, indepth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with low-income,
  Latino adults with a past or current history of cancer and/or their caregivers in
  a county comprised of 80% Latino populations in California. Interviews were conducted
  in Spanish, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated. Analysis was based in grounded
  theory and performed using the constant comparative method. Result(s): Fourteen
  interviews were conducted with a total of 18 participants; 9 involved the patient,
  4 involved the patient and a designated caregiver, and 1 involved a caregiver only.
  Four major themes emerged that included: 1) lack of overall understanding of all
  aspects of cancer including their cancer diagnosis, significance of advance directives,
  precision medicine, and cancer care plans; 2) severe challenges in communicating
  cancer care needs and receiving support services due to language barriers; 3) stress
  and anxiety regarding financial hardships related to job loss and insurance barriers;
  4) the need for supportive, bilingual and bicultural personnel to assist in overcoming
  these challenges. Conclusion(s): Latino patients with cancer and caregivers described
  major barriers they encounter after a cancer diagnosis. Participants described important
  approaches to address these cancer specific needs and reduce cancer disparities
  among these populations.'
