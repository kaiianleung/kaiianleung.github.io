abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to
  explore the characteristics of herbal remedy use for diabetes among Latinos/Hispanics
  with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: A convenience sample of 75 Latino/Hispanic adults
  with type 2 diabetes was recruited from community-based settings in North Carolina.
  Data were collected through face-to-face bilingual interviews. Measures included
  a demographic questionnaire; the Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Practices
  Questionnaire; and biophysical indicators of A1C and body mass index., RESULTS:
  Sixty-nine percent of the sample reported using herbal remedies for diabetes self-care.
  Forty-nine herbal products were identified. The most commonly reported products
  were prickly pear cactus, aloe vera, celery, and chayote. The perceived effectiveness
  of products varied; some said they helped \"a lot\" while others noted the development
  of side effects. Over three quarters (77%) of persons using herbal remedies reported
  concurrent use with prescribed medications. Also, some participants reported skipping
  or altering the dose of diabetes medications when using herbal remedies. Most (77%)
  reported not disclosing herbal remedy use to health care providers., CONCLUSIONS:
  Diabetes educators and other health care providers need to ask Latino/Hispanic clients
  about their use of herbal remedies and become knowledgeable about herbal products
  to provide advice about safety.'
