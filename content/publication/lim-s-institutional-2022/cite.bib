 abstract = {Institutional discrimination matters. The purpose of this longitudinal community-based participatory research study was to examine institutional procedural discrimination, institutional racism, and other institutional discrimination, and their relationships with participants' health during a maternal and child health program in a municipal initiative. Twenty participants from nine multilingual, multicultural community-based organizations were included. Overall reported incidences of institutional procedural discrimination decreased from April 2019 (18.6%) to November 2019 (11.8%) although changes were not statistically significant and participants reporting incidences remained high (n=15 in April and n=14 in November). Participants reported experiencing significantly less "[when] different cultural ways of doing things were shared, the project did not support my way" from April 2019 (23.5%, n=4) to November 2019 (0%, n=0), Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z=-2.00, p\textless0.05. Some participants reported experiencing institutional racism (29.4%, n=5) and other institutional discrimination (5.9%, n=1). Participants experiencing institutional racism, compared to those who did not, reported a higher impact of the Initiative's program on their quality of life (t=3.62, p\textless0.01). Participatory survey designs enable nurse researchers to identify hidden pathways of institutional procedural discrimination, describe the impacts experienced, and examine types of institutional discrimination in health systems.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.
