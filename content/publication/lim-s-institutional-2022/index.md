abstract: Institutional discrimination matters. The purpose of this longitudinal community-based
  participatory research study was to examine institutional procedural discrimination,
  institutional racism, and other institutional discrimination, and their relationships
  with participants' health during a maternal and child health program in a municipal
  initiative. Twenty participants from nine multilingual, multicultural community-based
  organizations were included. Overall reported incidences of institutional procedural
  discrimination decreased from April 2019 (18.6%) to November 2019 (11.8%) although
  changes were not statistically significant and participants reporting incidences
  remained high (n=15 in April and n=14 in November). Participants reported experiencing
  significantly less \"[when] different cultural ways of doing things were shared,
  the project did not support my way\" from April 2019 (23.5%, n=4) to November 2019
  (0%, n=0), Wilcoxon signed-rank test Z=-2.00, ptextless0.05. Some participants reported
  experiencing institutional racism (29.4%, n=5) and other institutional discrimination
  (5.9%, n=1). Participants experiencing institutional racism, compared to those who
  did not, reported a higher impact of the Initiative's program on their quality of
  life (t=3.62, ptextless0.01). Participatory survey designs enable nurse researchers
  to identify hidden pathways of institutional procedural discrimination, describe
  the impacts experienced, and examine types of institutional discrimination in health
  systems.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors. Nursing Inquiry published by John Wiley &
