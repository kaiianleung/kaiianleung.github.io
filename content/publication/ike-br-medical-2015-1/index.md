abstract: "OBJECTIVES: Dissemination of trusted disaster information to limited English
  proficient (LEP) communities may mitigate the negative effects these higher risk
  communities experience in disasters. For immigrant communities, disaster messages
  may be perceived with skepticism, and fear of public officials may affect compliance
  with disaster messages. This study explores whether medical interpreters (MIs) and
  bilingual school staff (BSS) are already informal information sources for LEP communities,
  and could their connection to both public service organizations and LEP communities
  make them ideal efficient, trusted disaster information conduits for LEP communities.,
  DESIGN: The authors conducted a mixed methods study, which included MI individual
  interviews, Latino community focus groups, an MI employer survey, and school administrator
  interviews., SETTING: To ensure diversity in the sample, data were collected in
  both Los Angeles and Seattle., RESULTS: MIs, MI employers, and schools are willing
  to communicate disaster information to LEP communities. MIs and BSS are connected
  to and share information with LEP communities. Latino LEP communities are eager
  for more disaster information and sources., CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence
  that a multipronged approach that includes collaborating with professionals linked
  to immigrant communities, such as MIs and BSS, could be an effective method of disaster
  information dissemination. Working with MIs and BSS as part of a wider dissemination
  strategy would promote a community-based interpersonal flow of information that
  would contribute to LEP community's trust in the message."
