abstract: Partnerships between communities and academic institutions have been vital
  in addressing complex health and psychosocial issues faced by culturally diverse
  and hard-to-reach populations. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has
  been suggested as a strategy to develop trust and build on the strengths of partners
  from various settings to address significant health issues, particularly those persistent
  health issues that reveal disparities among minority populations. There have been
  many challenges to developing these partnerships in the United States. The purpose
  of this paper is to discuss approaches and solutions used by this research team
  in response to the challenges they have faced in using CBPR. The team uses CBPR
  to understand and support the process of disclosure of intimate partner violence
  (IPV) within the context of the community health centers that provide services for
  multicultural and multi-lingual populations. While CBPR provides a route to develop
  trust and build on the strengths of partners from various settings, there are multiple
  challenges that arise when partnering organizations present with different infrastructures,
  missions, resources and populations served. Examples of common challenges and solutions
  from the literature and from the team's experience will be discussed. Implications
  for partners, partnerships, practice and research will be explored.
