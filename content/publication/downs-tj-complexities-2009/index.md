abstract: "Low income, multi-ethnic communities in Main South/Piedmont neighborhoods
  of Worcester, Massachusetts are exposed to cumulative, chronic built-environment
  stressors, and have limited capacity to respond, magnifying their vulnerability
  to adverse health outcomes. \\\"Neighborhood STRENGTH\\\", our community-based participatory
  research (CBPR) project, comprised four partners: a youth center; an environmental
  non-profit; a community-based health center; and a university. Unlike most CBPR
  projects that are single topic-focused, our 'holistic', systems-based project targeted
  five priorities. The three research-focused/action-oriented components were: (1)
  participatory monitoring of indoor and outdoor pollution; (2) learning about health
  needs and concerns of residents through community-based listening sessions; (3)
  engaging in collaborative survey work, including a household vulnerability survey
  and an asthma prevalence survey for schoolchildren. The two action-focused/research-informed
  components were: (4) tackling persistent street trash and illegal dumping strategically;
  and (5) educating and empowering youth to promote environmental justice. We used
  a coupled CBPR-capacity building approach to design, vulnerability theory to frame,
  and mixed methods: quantitative environmental testing and qualitative surveys. Process
  and outcomes yielded important lessons: vulnerability theory helps frame issues
  holistically; having several topic-based projects yielded useful information, but
  was hard to manage and articulate to the public; access to, and engagement with,
  the target population was very difficult and would have benefited greatly from having
  representative residents who were paid at the partners' table. Engagement with residents
  and conflict burden varied highly across components. Notwithstanding, we built enabling
  capacity, strengthened our understanding of vulnerability, and are able to share
  valuable experiential knowledge."
