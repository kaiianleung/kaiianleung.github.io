abstract: "Background: Social marginalization and criminalization create health and
  safety risks for sex workers and reduce their access to health promotion and prevention
  services compared to the general population. Community empowerment-based interventions
  that prioritize the engagement of sex workers show promising results. Peer-to-peer
  interventions, wherein sex workers act as educators of their colleagues, managers,
  clients and romantic partners, foster community mobilization and critical consciousness
  among sex workers and equip them to exercise agency in their work and personal lives.
  Methods: A pilot peer health education program was developed and implemented, with
  and for sex workers in one urban centre in Canada. To explore how the training program
  contributed to community empowerment and transformative learning among participants,
  the authors conducted qualitative interviews, asked participants to keep personal
  journals and to fill out feedback forms after each session. Thematic analysis was
  conducted on these three data sources, with emerging themes identified, organized
  and presented in the findings. Results: Five themes emerged from the analysis. Our
  findings show that the pilot program led to reduced internalized stigma and increased
  self-esteem in participants. Participants' critical consciousness increased concerning
  issues of diversity in cultural background, sexual orientation, work experiences
  and gender identity. Participants gained knowledge about how sex work stigma is
  enacted and perpetuated. They also became increasingly comfortable challenging negative
  judgments from others, including frontline service providers. Participants were
  encouraged to actively shape the training program, which fostered positive relationships
  and solidarity among them, as well as with colleagues in their social network and
  with the local sex worker organization housing the program. Resources were also
  mobilized within the sex worker community through skills building and knowledge
  acquisition. Conclusion: The peer education program proved successful in enhancing
  sex workers' community empowerment in one urban setting by increasing their knowledge
  about health issues, sharing information about and building confidence in accessing
  services, and expanding capacity to disseminate this knowledge to others. This 'proof
  of concept' built the foundation for a long-term initiative in this setting and
  has promise for other jurisdictions wishing to adapt similar programs."
