abstract: "BACKGROUND: Arthritis and other musculoskeletal diseases are the most prevalent
  health conditions in the USA, causing enormous financial and social burdens, especially
  in underserved communities. Targeted care and prevention programs are urgently needed.,
  QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Within an overall goal of revealing health disparities, the
  questionnaire explored (1) the use of and access to healthcare, (2) the factors
  affecting quality of life, and (3) the levels of provider-patient communication.,
  METHODS: A New York City musculoskeletal hospital conducted a community health needs
  survey among its diverse ethnic/racial communities. A 39-item questionnaire was
  administered online, by mail, and in person (in English, Spanish, and Chinese).
  Answers were analyzed in terms of sociodemographics, to define health disparities
  within a total sample and two subsamples., RESULTS: In the total sample, respondents
  were 60% White, 16% Black, 14% Hispanic/Latino, and 11% Asian, mostly female, and
  aged 50 to 79. More than 17% of the total sample indicated they could not access
  a healthcare provider when needed. Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity
  were large areas of concern, as were falls and poor self-reported health status.
  Nearly all respondents said they took steps to communicate with their healthcare
  providers. Dramatic health disparities were found between Whites and non-Whites
  (e.g., non-Whites were most likely to rate their health poorly, consider their diet
  fair or poor, lack health insurance, and be unable to access a healthcare provider).,
  CONCLUSION: The findings are being used to further refine, develop, and expand the
  hospital's community programs, especially for culturally diverse and underserved
  communities."
