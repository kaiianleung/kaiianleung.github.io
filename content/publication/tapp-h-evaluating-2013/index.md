abstract: 'Hispanic populations experience disparities in health outcomes and health
  care. Using participatory Methods, we evaluated 4 systems of primary care delivery
  for an uninsured Hispanic population. Best practices were determined that could
  be translated back to the partner clinics and the community. The assessment included
  patient service areas, provider discussion groups, patient surveys, calculation
  of travel distances, and costs. The following best practices were identified: improved
  proximity to services, enhanced bilingual services, affordable services, and integrated
  services. Researchers and providers not only identified translatable service delivery
  practices but also laid the foundation for ongoing research partnerships. Â© 2013
