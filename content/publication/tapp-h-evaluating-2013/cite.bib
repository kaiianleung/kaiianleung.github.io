 abstract = {Hispanic populations experience disparities in health outcomes and health care. Using participatory Methods, we evaluated 4 systems of primary care delivery for an uninsured Hispanic population. Best practices were determined that could be translated back to the partner clinics and the community. The assessment included patient service areas, provider discussion groups, patient surveys, calculation of travel distances, and costs. The following best practices were identified: improved proximity to services, enhanced bilingual services, affordable services, and integrated services. Researchers and providers not only identified translatable service delivery practices but also laid the foundation for ongoing research partnerships. Â© 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},
