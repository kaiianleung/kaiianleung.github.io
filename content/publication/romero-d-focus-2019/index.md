abstract: "OBJECTIVES: This research aims to understand undocumented immigrant participants'
  experiences, program participation levels, and desired improvements in the Options
  program, a sliding-scale fee-for-service model for un/under-insured patients operated
  by New York City (NYC) Health and Hospitals (H&H). METHOD(S): Community-engaged,
  mixed-methods included: focus groups (FG) (n=144), post-FG surveys, and key informant
  interviews (KII) (n=15) across all five NYC boroughs. All FG and KII transcripts
  were analyzed following grounded theory methodology. RESULT(S): Key findings include
  low awareness of Options; a need for greater community-based outreach efforts; prioritization
  of access, quality, and affordability of services; and need for activities that
  address concerns regarding immigrant status and fear of high bills and long-term
  debt. Program utilization depends on access, affordability, and patient experience
  factors, with particular emphasis on stigma associated with being poor and un/underinsured.
  DISCUSSION: Cultural humility training, diverse staff, and language services access
  may be the key to increased program success."
