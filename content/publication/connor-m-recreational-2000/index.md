abstract: Recreational international folk dance provides a gentle form of exercise
  for people of all age groups, and may be used by an occupational therapist to provide
  a different leisure option for older people. The older adult is often stereotypically
  perceived as being only capable of certain types of leisure activities, such as
  bowls, bingo and cards. In multicultural Australia, activities need to be more diverse.
  Recreational folk dance provides an activity that is socially engaging, physically
  challenging, creative, and culturally and mentally stimulating. Involvement in the
  activity has general exercise benefits, which contribute to a healthy lifestyle.
  The participants can be empowered by their increased participation in community
  life, due to the classes, but also because of the public performance aspect that
  is offered with this activity. Exposure to folk costumes, customs, and traditions,
  can increase awareness of other cultures. Recreational folk dance has a beneficial
  effect on interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects of self. The language of dance
  crosses many cultures. Gesture and movement can be conveyed without words, thus
  making folk dance a good 'non-language' based activity to be used in a multicultural
  population.
