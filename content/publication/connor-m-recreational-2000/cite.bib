 abstract = {Recreational international folk dance provides a gentle form of exercise for people of all age groups, and may be used by an occupational therapist to provide a different leisure option for older people. The older adult is often stereotypically perceived as being only capable of certain types of leisure activities, such as bowls, bingo and cards. In multicultural Australia, activities need to be more diverse. Recreational folk dance provides an activity that is socially engaging, physically challenging, creative, and culturally and mentally stimulating. Involvement in the activity has general exercise benefits, which contribute to a healthy lifestyle. The participants can be empowered by their increased participation in community life, due to the classes, but also because of the public performance aspect that is offered with this activity. Exposure to folk costumes, customs, and traditions, can increase awareness of other cultures. Recreational folk dance has a beneficial effect on interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects of self. The language of dance crosses many cultures. Gesture and movement can be conveyed without words, thus making folk dance a good 'non-language' based activity to be used in a multicultural population.},
