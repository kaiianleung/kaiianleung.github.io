abstract: 'To investigate a health promotion strategy to improve oral health among
  former refugees in New Zealand. Former refugees were recruited (n = 63) and answered
  a questionnaire about their oral home care, smoking, sugar consumption and use of
  dental services. Participants then joined either focus group sessions to co-design
  oral health educational material (n = 39) or to be dentally examined for oral hygiene,
  periodontal health, gingivitis and dental caries and receive motivational instructions
  to improve their oral health habits (n = 20). Health messages using dual-language
  leaflets (covering oral home care, smoking, diet and access to services) were subsequently
  individually delivered monthly to all participants via a mobile phone application.
  After 6 months, follow-up questionnaires were sent to all participants and those
  who had been dentally examined were re-examined. Half of those who did not brush
  twice daily at baseline (54.1%) had increased brushing to at least twice daily by
  follow-up; 76.9% of those who consumed sugary drinks at least twice daily, reduced
  their sugar intake. No smokers quit smoking, however, 52.4% reported reducing the
  number of cigarettes or engaging in smoking cessation activities. Among those who
  had been dentally examined, plaque scores, gingivitis and periodontal pocketing
  all decreased significantly. Culturally and linguistically tailored oral health
  promotion interventions led to improved oral health behaviours for this group of
  former refugees over a 6 months follow-up period. We expect this to not only improve
  the oral health quality of life for this population, but also reduce the burden
  on the health system.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University
