 abstract = {To investigate a health promotion strategy to improve oral health among former refugees in New Zealand. Former refugees were recruited (n = 63) and answered a questionnaire about their oral home care, smoking, sugar consumption and use of dental services. Participants then joined either focus group sessions to co-design oral health educational material (n = 39) or to be dentally examined for oral hygiene, periodontal health, gingivitis and dental caries and receive motivational instructions to improve their oral health habits (n = 20). Health messages using dual-language leaflets (covering oral home care, smoking, diet and access to services) were subsequently individually delivered monthly to all participants via a mobile phone application. After 6 months, follow-up questionnaires were sent to all participants and those who had been dentally examined were re-examined. Half of those who did not brush twice daily at baseline (54.1%) had increased brushing to at least twice daily by follow-up; 76.9% of those who consumed sugary drinks at least twice daily, reduced their sugar intake. No smokers quit smoking, however, 52.4% reported reducing the number of cigarettes or engaging in smoking cessation activities. Among those who had been dentally examined, plaque scores, gingivitis and periodontal pocketing all decreased significantly. Culturally and linguistically tailored oral health promotion interventions led to improved oral health behaviours for this group of former refugees over a 6 months follow-up period. We expect this to not only improve the oral health quality of life for this population, but also reduce the burden on the health system.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2022.
