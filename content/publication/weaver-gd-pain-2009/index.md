abstract: 'Objectives: To examine an association between pain severity and functional
  disability in older Mexican Americans. Design(s): Cross-sectional study (2005/06),
  a subsample of the Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiologic Study of the
  Elderly. Setting(s): Community. Participant(s): One thousand thirteen Mexican American
  aged 74 to 100. Measurement: Bilingual interviewers administered structured questionnaires
  and assessed physical measures of mobility and frailty (exhaustion, weight loss,
  walking speed, grip strength, and self-reported physical activity). Two items from
  the SF-36 questionnaire assessed pain experiences in the previous 4 weeks. Result(s):
  Chi-square one-way analysis of variance and least square and negative binomial regressions
  were computed for 744 participants with complete data to investigate experience
  of pain and other dimensions of health and functioning. Close to two-thirds (64.7%)
  reported pain within 4 weeks of the interview, and 49.7% reported that pain interfered
  with performance of daily activities. Female sex; low education; frailty; reduced
  mobility; disability; and high comorbidity, body mass index, and depressive symptomatology
  were significantly associated with pain severity and interference. Regression coefficients
  revealed that pain severity was significantly related to disability in activities
  of daily living (0.22, Ptextless.001) and instrumental activities of daily living
  (0.23, Ptextless.01) after controlling for sociodemographic and health status characteristics.
  Conclusion(s): The findings expand the pain literature on older Mexican Americans.
  High pain rates were most prevalent in women and subjects with high comorbidity,
  high depressive symptomatology, poor mobility, and frailty. Pain also plays a significant
  role in disability status. In-depth research is needed to understand the pain experiences
  of older Mexican Americans and their effect on health and well-being. Â© 2009, The
