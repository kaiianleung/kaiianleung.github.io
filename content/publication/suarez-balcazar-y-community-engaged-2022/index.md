abstract: Asset mapping is a participatory methodology that engages community members
  in identifying services and settings that promote health and well-being. This study
  aimed to identify community assets from the perspective of Latinx immigrant families
  with youth with disabilities. Latinx immigrant families (n=21) participated in the
  mapping, followed by a reflection session and an open forum (n=30). The findings
  revealed that families identified faith-based organizations and social service agencies
  as some of the main assets in their communities, while they identified mental health
  services as the most needed. The results also showed that participants preferred
  to utilize services and resources that are within walking distance of their homes,
  provide safe spaces, treat them well, offer bilingual services, do not require documentation,
  and are affordable. This study has important implications for community scholars
  and practitioners interested in implementing asset-based methodologies that focus
  on participants as experts of their own realities and agents of change and that
  promote advocacy and empowerment actions.Copyright Â© 2021 Society for Community
