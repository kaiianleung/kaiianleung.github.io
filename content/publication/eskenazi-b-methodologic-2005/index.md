abstract: In anticipation of the National Children's Study, lessons can be learned
  from the smaller birth cohort studies conducted by five Centers for Children's Environmental
  Health and Disease Prevention Research funded by the National Institute of Environmental
  Health Sciences and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The populations studied
  are diverse in ethnicity and social class and reside in urban and rural environments.
  Although almost all of the centers chose to enroll participants through medical
  care facilities, they had to develop independent staffs and structures because of
  the overburdened medical care system. Some of the lessons learned by the centers
  include the importance of continuous funding, building community partnerships to
  conduct culturally appropriate research, hiring bilingual and bicultural staff from
  the community, prioritizing research goals, developing biorepositories to ensure
  future utility of samples, instituting quality control procedures for all aspects
  of specimen and data collection, maintaining frequent contact with study participants,
  ensuring ethical conduct of the research in a changing medical-legal climate, and
  communicating results in a timely and appropriate manner to participants and the
  wider community. All centers underestimated the necessary start-up time, staff,
  and costs in conducting these birth cohort studies. Despite the logistical complexity
  and added expenses, all centers emphasize the importance of studying the impact
  of environmental exposures on those children most at risk, those living in minority
  and low-income communities. These centers present barriers encountered, solutions
  found, and considerations for future research, with the hope that the lessons learned
  can help inform the planning and conduct of the National Children's Study.
