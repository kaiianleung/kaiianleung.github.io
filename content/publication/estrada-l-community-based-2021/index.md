abstract: 'Objectives: 1. Compare the community-based advance care planning interventions
  for racial/ethnic minority older adults. 2. Appraise the community-based advance
  care planning interventions aimed at increasing engagement in racial/ethnic minorities.
  Background and Objectives: Racial/ethnic minority older adults in the United States
  (US) often experience access, language, and cultural barriers to advance care planning.
  Our aim was to summarize and appraise the current science on interventions aimed
  at increasing advance care planning in racial/ethnic minority, community-dwelling
  older adults. Study Identification: We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, and
  Embase databases until April 2020. We included articles representing interventional,
  community-based, primary research in the US for racial/ethnic minority older adults
  in the US. We excluded studies that targeted caregiver, family, or surrogates due
  to wide variation in demographics. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Following PRISMA
  guidelines, two researchers independently screened articles identified in the systematic
  search, reviewed eligible articles, and abstracted data using a standardized data
  extraction form. Two reviewers appraised the quality of the included articles using
  the Downs and Black checklist and a third reviewer settled discrepancies. Result(s):
  1823 abstracts and titles were reviewed, five met the inclusion criteria, which
  represented four unique interventions. Interventions were conducted in Asian American
  (n=2) and Hispanic (n=2) communities. Interventions included educational nurse-led
  workshops (n=2) and one-on-one social worker-led sessions (n=2). Quality appraisal
  identified methodological weaknesses including convenience samples and self-reported
  outcomes. Outcomes measured were intention to complete or completion of advance
  directive or advance care planning discussion, an improvement in advance directive
  knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward and comfort with end-of-life care planning.
  The interventions increased intention to or completion of an advance directive and
  improved advance care planning knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. However, Results
  were inconclusive regarding promoting advance care planning discussions with family
  and health care providers. Conclusions and Implications: Existing literature on
  interventions to increase advance care planning in US racial/ethnic minority older
  adults is limited and specific to certain populations. Although the Results from
  these studies were promising, high-quality interventions that reflect the diverse
  needs and barriers to advance care planning are needed.Copyright Â© 2021'
