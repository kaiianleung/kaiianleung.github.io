 #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

 #   summary: |
 #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Kai (she/her) is currently pursuing her PhD in Rehabilitation Sciences (SLP stream), with a collaborative specialization in neuroscience. 

Her doctoral research, conducted in collaboration with the Hospital for Sick Children, focuses on examining language and cognition in linguistically diverse children following a pediatric stroke, aiming to better understand the neurodiversity of bilingual development. Additionally, she is working on a mixed-methods study to develop a bilingual language history tool for clinical use also as part of her thesis research.
