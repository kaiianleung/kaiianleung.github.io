	abstract = {Background: In order for precision health to address health disparities, engagement of diverse racial/ethnic minority communities and the physicians that serve them is critical. Method(s): A community-based participatory research approach with mixed methods was employed to gain a deeper understanding of precision health research and practice among American Indian, African American, Latino, Chinese, and Vietnamese groups and physicians that serve these communities. A survey assessed demographics and opinions of precision health, genetic testing, and precision health research. Focus groups (n=12) with each racial/ethnic minority group and physicians further explored attitudes about these topics. Result(s): One hundred community members (American Indian [n=17], African American [n=13], Chinese [n=17], Latino [n=27], and Vietnamese [n=26]) and 14 physicians completed the survey and participated in the focus groups. Familiarity with precision health was low among community members and high among physicians. Most groups were enthusiastic about the approach, especially if it considered influences on health in addition to genes (eg, environmental, behavioral, social factors). Significant concerns were expressed by African American and American Indian participants about precision health practice and research based on past abuses in biomedical research. In addition, physician and community members shared concerns such as security and confidentiality of genetic information, cost and affordability of genetic tests and precision medicine, discrimination and disparities, distrust of medical and research and pharmaceutical institutions, language barriers, and physician's specialty. Conclusion(s): Engagement of racial/ethnic minority communities and the providers who serve them is important for advancing a precision health approach to addressing health disparities.Copyright Â© 2020 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

We recruited participants from schools, churches, clinics, community events, and other community-based locations. Facilitators of participation included: partnership with local community groups, conducting research in familiar settings, building on existing social networks, and matching perspectives of community members and researchers. Findings suggest recruitment success occurs when there is a match between goals of Filipino parents, grandparents and the research community. Understanding the perspectives of ethnic minority communities and effectively communicating goals of research studies are critical to successful recruitment of hard-to-reach immigrant populations in randomized controlled trials.},

	title = {Barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access among adolescent latinas in alabama: {When} immigration is a social determinant of health},
	volume = {62},
	abstract = {Purpose: Alabama (AL) experienced a 145\% increase in its Latino pop-ulation between 2000 and 2010; making it the state with the second fastest growing Latino population in the United States (US) during that time. Job opportunities in the agricultural, lumber and poultry industries drew (mostly Mexican and Central-American) immigrant families to AL. Since then, AL has become one of the states with the most severe anti-immigrant policies in the nation. Adolescent Latinas in the US and in AL are disproportionately affected by sexual health disparities compared to their non-Hispanic, white counterparts. However, to our knowledge, no other researchers have examined barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access for this sub-population. The purpose of this study is to examine barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access among adolescent Latinas' through in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews (phase 1 of 3-phase study) to develop community driven, theory based, culturally-relevant, multilevel intervention strategies through a community-engaged process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) and the socioecological model of health provided the philosophical and theoretical frameworks, respectively. Method(s): From January to June of 2017, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with adolescents who: self-identified as Latina, were between 15 and 20 years, had been in the US for over five years, and lived in West AL. Participants were recruited through venue-based, purposeful-convenience sampling. Two bilingual (in English and Spanish) coders used an iterative process (between independent coding and consensus building) to analyze the data in NVivo 11. Result(s): Twenty young women participated in the study. Sixty-five percent self-identified as Mexican, 45\% were between 15-16 years of age and 55\% were between 17-19 years of age. Sixty-percent reported that they had health insurance and 35\% reported that they had initiated sexual intercourse in their lifetime. With regard to sexual healthcare access, three main facilitators/barriers emerged: (1) parental approval/disapproval and embarrassment ("pena"); (2) structural facilitators/barriers to care (e.g., lack of transportation, flexible clinic hours); and (3) positive/negative experiences with providers (e.g., perceived discrimination based on immigrant status). When we asked what they would like in a sexual health promotion program, emergent themes included: (1) "parents should be involved in programming"; and (2) "the program should be delivered by young Latinas who understand our experience". Conclusion(s): This work points to the importance of community driven, theory based, culturally-relevant approaches to address the healthcare access needs of under-served immigrant populations in emerging Latino/a communities in states like Alabama, where anti-immigrant sentiment and policies create real and perceived barriers to care. We will discuss our findings in light of the current sociopolitical context both in Alabama and nationally and position our findings within the extant literature which conceptualizes immigration (a global phenomenon) as a social determinant of health.

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older Chinese Americans have a disproportionately higher rate of undertreated hypertension (HTN) compared to non-Latino Whites, and Asian Americans report weaker patient-provider engagement than desired. As patient activation can be a powerful driver of improved HTN control, we assessed the efficacy of a culturally tailored clinical pharmacist intervention on patient activation among immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. METHOD(S): We conducted a pre-post, prospective intervention with repeated measures in Los Angeles County. We screened and recruited patients from 8 community health centers and private practice clinics between 2015-2016. Eligible patients (age 60+, medically insured, past year visit at study clinic, at least 2 of 3 systolic blood pressure [BP] readings above JNC-8 goal in past year) were invited to a study information session through mailings and telephone calls in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Enrolled participants had 3 visits within 3 months with bilingual study pharmacists, who were trained to elicit HTN explanatory models when providing HTN education and use motivational interviewing (MI) and shared decision-making (SDM) when counseling patients on lifestyle changes and BP medications. Study participants' physicians received a brief summary of each visit and signed pharmacist recommendations for medications or lab orders if in agreement. Participants completed baseline and final surveys before their first and after their last pharmacist visit, including demographic information and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). We also conducted chart reviews to obtain clinical information. We estimated a sample size of 50 patients would detect a clinically significant 3 to 5-point difference in our primary outcome, PAM scores, with 80\% power. We tested for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULT(S): We screened 415 potential participants to enroll 50 immigrant Chinese American seniors who received the intervention. The average age was 71 years, and 23 (47\%) were female. Participants had resided in the U.S. for an average of 30 years, but only 10 (20\%) were comfortable speaking English. Median baseline level of trust in pharmacists was "somewhat" to "strongly trust". The mean baseline PAM score was 58.8 signifying "beginning to take action," with a mean change of -2.04 +/- 13.9 (p = 0.48) at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): While clinical pharmacist HTN interventions have shown success in some settings, our intervention utilizing MI and SDMstrategies was not associated with increases in PAM scores for immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. Despite strong project involvement of community partners in these predominantly Asian neighborhoods, eligible seniors frequently declined to enroll. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to identify other team-based care approaches which may be more appealing and successful at increasing patient activation for HTN control in this population.},

	abstract = {Study objective: Individuals in neighborhoods composed of minority and lower socioeconomic status populations are more likely to have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest event, less likely to have bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed, and less likely to survive. Latino cardiac arrest victims are 30\% less likely than whites to have bystander CPR performed. The goal of this study is to identify barriers and facilitators to calling 911, and learning and performing CPR in 5 low-income, Latino neighborhoods in Denver, CO. Method(s): Six focus groups and 9 key informant interviews were conducted in Denver during the summer of 2012. Purposeful and snowball sampling, conducted by community liaisons, was used to recruit participants. Two reviewers analyzed the data to identify recurrent and unifying themes. A qualitative content analysis was used with a 5-stage iterative process to analyze each transcript. Result(s): Six key barriers to calling 911 were identified: fear of becoming involved because of distrust of law enforcement, financial, immigration status, lack of recognition of cardiac arrest event, language, and violence. Seven cultural barriers were identified that may preclude performance of bystander CPR: age, sex, immigration status, language, racism, strangers, and fear of touching someone. Participants suggested that increasing availability of tailored education in Spanish, increasing the number of bilingual 911 dispatchers, and policy-level changes, including CPR as a requirement for graduation and strengthening Good Samaritan laws, may serve as potential facilitators in increasing the provision of bystander CPR. Conclusion(s): Distrust of law enforcement, language concerns, lack of recognition of cardiac arrest, and financial issues must be addressed when community-based CPR educational programs for Latinos are implemented.Copyright Â© 2014 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dissemination of trusted disaster information to limited English proficient (LEP) communities may mitigate the negative effects these higher risk communities experience in disasters. For immigrant communities, disaster messages may be perceived with skepticism, and fear of public officials may affect compliance with disaster messages. This study explores whether medical interpreters (MIs) and bilingual school staff (BSS) are already informal information sources for LEP communities, and could their connection to both public service organizations and LEP communities make them ideal efficient, trusted disaster information conduits for LEP communities., DESIGN: The authors conducted a mixed methods study, which included MI individual interviews, Latino community focus groups, an MI employer survey, and school administrator interviews., SETTING: To ensure diversity in the sample, data were collected in both Los Angeles and Seattle., RESULTS: MIs, MI employers, and schools are willing to communicate disaster information to LEP communities. MIs and BSS are connected to and share information with LEP communities. Latino LEP communities are eager for more disaster information and sources., CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that a multipronged approach that includes collaborating with professionals linked to immigrant communities, such as MIs and BSS, could be an effective method of disaster information dissemination. Working with MIs and BSS as part of a wider dissemination strategy would promote a community-based interpersonal flow of information that would contribute to LEP community's trust in the message.},

Use evidence-based care for effective practice. 3. Increase breastfeeding rates to approach Healthy- People 2020 goals. Materials/Methods: A systematic integrated approach was taken based on the Prevention Institute's Clinical/Community Population Health Intervention Model: 1. Inquiry 2. Assessment 3. Action. Result(s): The Loudoun Breastfeeding Coalition was formed with key stakeholders from the community. Clinical service points and gaps from prenatal to early childhood were analyzed and streamlined. A clinical breastfeeding center with bilingual staff was established. Best-practice clinical protocols were implemented and built into the electronic health record. In 2013, the center provided more than 140 consultations to more than 90 low-income women. The dyads who received lactation support were more likely to breastfeed exclusively at 2, 4, 6 and 9-12 months than those dyads who did not receive support (32\% vs. 24\%, 20\% vs. 13\%, and 17\% vs. 13\%, respectively).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in vision impairment are prevalent as are low rates for recommended eye screenings, such as annual dilated eye exams for people with diabetes (40-65 \%). A communityacademic partnership aimed to improve vision screening in a low-income, minority neighborhood by developing a multi-component vision health toolkit for social service providers to promote comprehensive vision exams among their consumers. METHOD(S): The team developed and tested a bilingual toolkit that included posters, brochures, table tents and magnifier cards. Thirty-seven local social service agencies (i.e., senior centers, food pantries), faith-based organizations and health centers were recruited to adopt the toolkit and have at least one staff member or volunteer serve as a Vision Health Champion for that site. We surveyed a subset of consumers at 15 intervention and 3 control sites before and 6 months after disseminating the toolkits to assess receipt of comprehensive eye exams, vision knowledge and comorbidities, and surveyed Vision Health Champions to assess implementation and provider knowledge at these same times. RESULT(S): The 156 consumers surveyed were largely female (68 \%), Black (55 \%) and had high diabetes (23 \%) and hypertension (33 \%) rates. At baseline, 72 \% reported an eye exam in the past year and vision knowledge was fairly high (91 \% correctly answered 3 or more out of 7 vision knowledge items). There was no baseline difference between intervention and control sites self-reported eye exam rates in the past year. Six month follow-up surveys were completed with 62 \% of consumers. People at intervention sites were more likely to report a comprehensive eye exam in the past 6 months (45 \% vs. 24 \%, p=0.06). Those with diabetes at intervention sites were also more likely to have had an eye exam in the past 6 months than those with diabetes at control sites (66 \% vs. 33 \%, p{\textless}0.01). With respect to 44 of 61 Vision Health Champions surveyed at follow-up (72 \% response rate), 80 \% stated that the toolkit was easy to implement, 32 \% integrated it into pre-existing programming and 90 \% planned to continue using it. CONCLUSION(S): Even in a small pilot project, we demonstrated a significant increase in comprehensive eye examinations at intervention sites compared with control sites and among the targeted group - individuals with diabetes. We further demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a sustainable community-based intervention in a low-income setting at locations where people frequently congregate and interact with a range of social service providers. Novel, scalable approaches such as the use of Vision Health Champions in social service settings are a viable means of preventing and controlling diabetes complications, including vision loss.},

	abstract = {Background: Chinese Americans are the largest Asian subgroup in the U.S., and many are recent immigrants with high rates of cancer, a leading cause of death for this population. Although Chinese American patients frequently present with advanced illness and poorly controlled pain, information on symptom burden in this population is very limited. As part of an ongoing community study to test the effectiveness of a rapid-cycle quality improvement (QI) intervention to enhance symptom management, we evaluated the prevalence and burden of cancer symptoms in a large sample of first-generation, non-English speaking, ethnic Chinese patients. Method(s): A consecutive sample of Chinese American patients in two large community-based oncology practices and one hospital-based practice in New York were screened for cancer symptoms. Eligible adults who self-identified as ethnic Chinese, spoke Cantonese or Mandarin as their primary language, and had a history of cancer completed translated instruments assessing symptom prevalence, severity, and distress administered by bilingual research assistants. The study was approved by the IRB at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Result(s): Of 1,018 cancer patients screened to date (62.2\% women; M age = 64.0 years (SD = 13.7, range = 23 to 101); 20.6\% reported persistent cancer pain for the past month. The most common cancers were breast (34.3\%) lung (12.6\%), and head and neck (11.8\%) and 41.9\% were undergoing active treatment. The mean worst pain intensity on a 0-10 numeric scale was 5.5 (SD = 2.2), with 34.4\% rating their worst pain as {\textgreater} 6 of 10. Many (84.5\%) reported other symptoms, including fatigue (54.4\%), dry mouth (52.4\%), difficulty sleeping (44.8\%), and drowsiness (37.5\%). Overall, 32.7\% rated their symptoms as "quite a bit" or "very much" distressing, with sleep disturbance (33.1\%), lack of appetite (31.3\%), and constipation (29.2\%) causing the most severe distress. Conclusion(s): Symptom burden is high among community-dwelling, economically-disadvantaged ethnic Chinese cancer patients. Our ongoing QI intervention may alleviate the high symptom rate in this population and clarify potential patient, provider, and system-related factors that are associated with symptom control outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Community Based Medical Education (CBME) clinical staff have seen increasing numbers of patients without English fluency, increasing UK medical student numbers1 and the increase in community placements. This has resulted in more students observing non-English language community-based consultations. Anecdotally, negative comments have been raised by students regarding this potentially rich learning environment. Data was gathered to explore the students' opinions of non-English language consultations. Methodology: Comments regarding community learning experiences were gathered from year three and four students using mixed methods. Data was themed using a grounded theory approach. Result(s): Students' perceptions of non-English language consultations were frequently negative. They suggested that little learning was possible in this environment and the overall experience was viewed poorly. Students enjoyed talking to patients but this was much harder if they had no shared language. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Implications of students' perceptions of medical interactions with patients who do not speak English are important in a globally mobile population. Concepts such as cultural competency, professionalism,2 and patient centredness3 may be lost without addressing this issue. Students may miss the opportunity to learn how serve the full range of their patient population in their future careers. Future work is required by university and community tutors to maximise the potential learning from this rich environment to effectively translate into a useful experience for students.},

Organizational factors included problems with access to care related to cost, lack of bilingual providers, and culturally competent care; and community level factors included distance between resources and the need for services to be provided in community sites. Immigration status and acculturation were identified as factors at all levels.},

They explore the advantages and challenges of being trained for both researcher and health educator roles, describe opportunities to use this approach to assess service needs, and discuss the potential for personal empowerment. They also report on the time commitment that such a bilingual project requires. In the process of interviewing marginalized women, they realized how much health promotion and participatory research complement each other. The authors conclude that combining participatory research with health promotion activities has promise to contribute toward increased empowerment of immigrant communities.},

The CSAP Initiative is the first major federal effort to develop community-based integrated HIV and substance abuse prevention approaches targeting racial/ethnic populations that have been disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. This article describes the current state of HIV prevention research involving racial/ethnic minority populations and the current status of the CSAP Initiative. The data collected through the CSAP Initiative, implemented by 47 community organizations, will help to fill the existing knowledge gap about how to best prevent HIV in these communities. This data collection effort is an unparalleled opportunity to learn about risk and protective factors, including contextual factors, that are critical to the prevention of HIV/AIDS in African American, Latino, and other racial/ethnic minority communities but that are often not investigated.},

This is due to a variety of reasons: socioeconomic injustice and racialization, lack of access to equitable healthcare, and linguistic discrimination. As a result, several communities and community types demonstrated this effect when perceptions of inferences or other COVID-related information were measured. This paper reports on a participatory collaborative study with two Indigenous communities in rural Peru-ten Quechua-speaking communities in Southern Cuzco and three Shipibo-speaking communities in Ucayali regions. We investigate the communities' level of preparedness for the crisis by eliciting answers based on the World Health Organization COVID 'MythBusters' in a form of a semi-structured interview. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and analyzed in search of the effect of three variables: gender (male/female), language group (Shipibo/Quechua), and proficiency in the Indigenous language (from 0 to 4). Data reveal that all three variables have some effect on the target comprehension of COVID-related messages. Additionally, we explore other possible explanations. Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.},

This article highlights an adaptable model being used to support the development of contextually appropriate puberty education, in the form of illustrated and often bilingual books, for early adolescent girls and boys in countries around the world. This youth-centered participatory research and design model, which relies on the generation of community and government partnerships, has been employed in 10 countries thus far. Valuable learning has been documented from various contexts, including the approach's flexibility in adapting to the inputs of government and community members, incorporating local buy-in as a key ingredient for sustainability, using in-country experts for social and cultural appropriateness of illustrations and translations, and ensuring that the authentic youth voices captured through the participatory data collection and field-testing shape the educational content. The continuous integration of insights and perceptions of adults who influence young people's lives into the development process is also essential to enabling the uptake of puberty content in each new country. Parents, educators, youth service providers, and government officials are often the gatekeepers to young adolescents receiving puberty content and are thus critical to the process. This review of more than a decade of experience using this model underscores the essentiality of 2 key components-local partnership and participatory data collection-and highlights the importance of flexible approaches that are adapted to the unique sociocultural and environmental conditions in each country context.

	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.1111/ajco.12818},
	abstract = {AIM: Clinical trials play a critical role in advancing cancer care, but international research shows that few cancer patients, particularly culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients, participate in trials. This limits generalizability of trial results and increases health disparities. This study aimed to establish rates and correlates of trial participation among CALD patients in South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD), a highly culturally diverse area., METHODS: Data from all cancer patients diagnosed and/or treated in SWSLHD from January 2006 to July 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome was trial enrolment among patients born in non-English speaking countries (CALD) versus English speaking countries (non-CALD). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated CALD status as a predictor of trial participation. Moderators of trial participation by the different CALD groups, namely those whose preferred language was English (CALD-PLE) or was not English (CALD-PLNE), were examined by testing interactions between CALD status and other demographic and clinical variables., RESULTS: A total of 19 453 patients were analyzed (54.9\% non-CALD, 16.5\% CALD-PLE, 18.5\% CALD-PLNE). Overall, 7.4\% of patients were enrolled in a trial. Trial participation was significantly lower in CALD patients than non-CALD patients (5.7\% vs 8.4\%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.91; P = 0.001). CALD-PLNE patients were less likely to participate in trials than non-CALD (OR = 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.56; P {\textless} 0.0001) and CALD-PLE patients (OR = 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.41; P {\textless} 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Limited English proficiency seems particularly unfavorable to trial participation. Development and evaluation of strategies to overcome language barriers (e.g. simplified and translated multimedia participant information materials) is needed.

	doi = {10.2196/14555},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-income older adults experience disparities in oral health problems, including caries and periodontal disease, that can exacerbate already high levels of chronic and acute health problems. Behavioral interventions have been shown to improve oral health status but are typically administered in institutional rather than community settings. Furthermore, multiple simultaneous interventions at different levels in the locations where people live and work are likely to have more impact and sustainability than single interventions in clinical settings., OBJECTIVE: This paper outlines a protocol for conducting a bilingual 5-year community-based trial of a bilevel intervention that addresses community norms, beliefs, intentions, and practices to improve oral health hygiene of vulnerable older adults living in publicly subsidized housing. The intervention utilizes (1) a face-to-face counseling approach (adapted motivational interviewing [AMI]) and (2) resident-run oral health campaigns in study buildings., METHODS: The study's modified fractional factorial crossover design randomizes 6 matched buildings into 2 conditions: AMI followed by campaign (AB) and campaign followed by AMI (BA). The total intervention cycle is approximately 18 months in duration. The design compares the 2 interventions alone (T0-T1), and in different sequences (T1-T2), using a self-reported survey and clinical assessment to measure Plaque Score (PS) and Gingival Index (GI) as outcomes. A final timepoint (T3), 6 months post T2, assesses sustainability of each sequence. The intervention is based on the Fishbein integrated model that includes both individual and contextual modifiers, norms and social influence, beliefs, attitudes, efficacy, and intention as predictors of improvements in PS, GI, and oral health quality of life. The cognitive and behavioral domains in the intervention constitute the mechanisms through which the intervention should have a positive effect. They are tailored through the AMI and targeted to building populations through the peer-facilitated oral health campaigns. The sample size is 360, 180 in each condition, with an attrition rate of 25\%. The study is funded by National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and has been reviewed by University of Connecticut and NIDCR institutional review boards and NIDCR's clinical trials review procedures., RESULTS: When compared against each other, the face-to-face intervention is expected to have greater positive effects on clinical outcomes and oral health quality of life through the mediators. When sequences are compared, the results may be similar but affected by different mediators. The arm consisting of the BA is expected to have better sustainability. The protocol's unique features include the comparative effectiveness crossover design; the introduction of new emotion-based mediators; the balancing of fidelity, tailoring, and targeting; and resident engagement in the intervention., CONCLUSIONS: If successful, the evaluated interventions can be scaled up for implementation in other low-income congregate living and recreational settings with older adult collectives., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02419144; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02419144., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/14555.

	abstract = {Background: Food is a cultural symbol for Hispanics/Latinos, an ethnic group with high prevalence of diet-related diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Evidence supports prevention of obesity and related diseases through nutrition education and lifestyle interventions delivered by paraprofessionals. This study examined cultural competency characteristics and cultural knowledge of paraprofessionals delivering a nutrition education intervention to low-income Hispanics/Latinos in an East South-Central state. Methods: A mixed-methods study with paraprofessionals was completed. A web-based, 42-item survey assessed demographics, cultural competency and diversity training in 76/. In-depth interviews about cultural knowledge and practices were completed with paraprofessionals providing nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos (n=8). Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Results: The majority of the respondents were non-Hispanic Whites (88.1\%) and had completed diversity training (86.8\%). The first theme reported for consideration in nutrition education for Hispanics/Latinos is the inclusion of both parents and children in nutrition education; an important aspect was engaging the whole family in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Next, they reported engagement with community partners as key in building trust and relationships with this community. These paraprofessionals worked with schools, churches and migrant camps to deliver nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos. Finally, nutrition education paraprofessionals perceived nutrition education as an empowerment tool for Hispanic/Latino families to improve their health and socially engaged. Conclusion: Paraprofessionals provide an advantage in delivering culturally-sensitive nutrition education to ethnically diverse communities such as Hispanics/Latinos. Their knowledge of the family dynamics and community resources demonstrates their ability to engage this community in a culturally sensitive manner.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are measurement instruments that patients complete to provide information on aspects of their health status that are relevant to their quality of life. The use of PROMs improves patient-clinician communication, emotional well-being of patients and clinical management, as well as patient satisfaction with care. The Basque Country straddles the boundary between France and Spain, under different administrations. The Basque Autonomous Community is a bilingual setting, with a population of approximately 2,100,000 people and two official languages (Spanish and Basque). The Basque Health Service Osakidetza adopts an integrated approach merging hospitals and primary care units, organized in 13 Integrated Health Organizations (IHOs). Objectives: to study the use of PROMs in Osakidetza, and the availability of validated PROMs in both official languages, exploring the potential gaps in research and health assessments in a bilingual context. Methods: a descriptive study was undertaken to: i) identify the integrated care units and departments of Osakidetza in which PROMs are being systematically used (this information was obtained through the Directorate of Health Assistance) ii) explore the scope of the PROMs and the importance of having them available in local languages; and iii) identify the languages in which the PROMs are being offered, by asking the program managers. Results: the systematic use of PROMs in clinical care and research is confined to the Departments of Neurology, Urology and Radiotherapy Oncology of the Ezkerraldea-Enkarterri-Gurutzeta IHO. In this case they are administered to those patients with localized prostate cancer and stroke, who are registered in 'My quality of life' program delivered by Osakidetza since 2017 in partnership with the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement. The PROMs used are the PROMIS Global-10, EPIC 26, and EORT QLQ-PR-25. No information has been collected from mental health units. Validated Basque versions of these instruments are not currently in use. Conclusions: This study shows that in Osakidetza the systematic use of PROMs is not common in clinical care, and there are not validated versions available in Basque. PROMs offer the opportunity of putting the patient at the core of the evidence, reflecting person centred care and a shared decision model. Linguistic minorities should be considered at every step of clinical research or care assessment, so PROMs require a process of translation and cultural adaptation to different languages, in order to ensure the feasibility, validity and reliability. In bilingual settings like the Basque Country, PROMs should be available in both languages. We suggest fostering the translation and validation of PROMs in both official languages, and to extend their use to close the gap for improving health research and monitoring health outcomes from an individual and community perspective. With this purpose, we propose that Osakidetza's Basque language schemes should reflect these needs and promote validated questionnaires through collaborative work, in partnership with the basque universities.},

The aim of this study is to measure the impact of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH 2010) project, a community-based intervention to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in blood cholesterol screening in minority communities. METHODS: Annual survey data from 2001 to 2006 were gathered in 22 communities. Trends in the prevalence of age-standardised blood cholesterol screening were examined for four racial/ethnic groups (black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native), stratified by education level, and compared with national data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: The prevalence of cholesterol screening increased among persons in black, Hispanic and Asian REACH communities (p{\textless}0.001), whereas prevalence decreased in the total US and Hispanic populations (p{\textless}0.001) and remained similar among blacks and Asians nationwide. The relative disparity between the total US population and most REACH communities decreased (p{\textless}0.05). Relative disparity in cholesterol screening related to education level decreased (p{\textless}0.05) within REACH communities, whereas relative disparity related to education level nationwide remained similar in blacks and increased (p{\textless}0.001) in Hispanics.

Linear regression models identified factors associated with difficulty finding easy-to-understand COVID-19 information.Results Across 708 participants (88\% born overseas, 31\% poor English proficiency), difficulty finding easy-to-understand COVID-19 information was rated 4.13 for English materials (95\%CI: 3.85 to 4.41) and 4.36 for translated materials (95\%CI: 4.07 to 4.66) (1 easy to 10 hard). Participants who were older (p\&lt;0.001), had inadequate health literacy (Mean Difference (MD)=-1.43, 95\%CI -2.03 to - 0.82, p\&lt;0.001), or poor English proficiency (MD=-1.9, 95\%CI-2.51 to -1.29, p\&lt;0.001) found it harder to find easy-to-understand English-language COVID-19 information. Those who had greater difficulty finding easy-to-understand translated COVID-19 information were younger (p=0.004), had poor English proficiency (MD=-1.61, 95\%CI -2.29 to -0.9, p\&lt;0.001), university education (MD=0.77, 95\%CI 0.00 to 1.53, p=0.05), and had spent longer living in Australia (p=0.001).

	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health emergency requiring an effective public health response including citizenâs roles in preventing spread and controlling the pandemic. Little is known about public knowledge, beliefs and behaviors in-relation to the pandemic in Nepal. This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 among the general public and to identify associated factors.Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May - June 2020 with a sample of 645, recruited from 26 hospitals across Nepal. We conducted telephone interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire related to KAP regarding COVID-19. T-test and one-way ANOVA was conducted to determine group differences for socio-demographic variables. Linear regression and correlational analysis were performed to identify associated factors and measure strength and direction of relationships.Results Overall mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 11.6 (SD 4.5), 2.7 (SD 1.8), and 9.9 (SD 1.93) respectively but differed by socio-demographic characteristics. Positive but weak linear correlations were observed between knowledge-practice (r=0.19, p\&lt;0.01) and attitude-practice (r=0.08, p\&lt;0.05). The relationship between knowledge and education was fairly strong (r = 0.34, p\&lt; 0.01). Province, place of residence, ecological area, age, gender and caste/ethnicity were also significantly associated with KAP score of participants.Conclusion The study found varying degrees of correlation between Knowledge, Attitude and Practice that may increase as the pandemic evolves in Nepal. Knowledge and level of education had positive associations with attitude and adherence of precautionary measures. The findings suggest a need for targeted community awareness interventions for the most vulnerable populations, men, those with no school education, the elderly and people living in rural areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding available for this researchAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC) - ERB Protocol Registration No. 317/2020P.

	abstract = {Background Vaccine hesitancy is a potential threat to global public health. Since, there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic, much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine, and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia.Methods A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using snowball sampling strategy under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual, self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and sent to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants that predict vaccine acceptance among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis.Results Of the 1000 survey invitees, 992 responded to the survey (response rate, 99.2\%). The majority (65.8\%) of the study participants were female, 29.53\% were in the age group (36â45 years), and 17.9\% were non-Saudi. Of the 992 respondents, 642 (64.72\%) showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available. Willingness to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2\% among 45+ year old), being married (69.3\%), participants with education level postgraduate degree or higher (68.8\%), non-Saudi (69.1\%), employed in government sector (68.9\%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95\% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95\% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p \&lt;.05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept the vaccine (aOR: 3.05; 95\% CI: 1.13-4.92), and those having a higher perceived risk of acquiring infection were 2.13 times (95\% CI: 1.35-3.85) higher odds of accepting the vaccine.Conclusion Addressing sociodemographic determinants relating to the COVID-19 vaccination may help to increase uptake of the global vaccination program to tackle future pandemics.

	abstract = {A wealth of research has investigated the effects of bilingualism on cognition, especially on executive function. Developmental studies reveal different cognitive profiles between monolinguals and bilinguals in (audio-)visual attention tasks, which might stem from their attention allocation differences. Yet, whether such distinction exists in the auditory domain alone is unknown. In this study, we compared differences in auditory attention, measured by standardized tests, between monolingual and bilingual children. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in three electronic databases: OVID Medline, OVID PsycInfo, and EBSCO CINAHL. Empirical studies using standardized tests to assess auditory attention in monolingual and bilingual participants aged less than 18 years were included. Among the 20 studies identified, we performed a meta-analysis and found that test measure (accuracy vs. response times) was significantly related to differences in effect sizes whereas other factors (e.g., participant age, stimulus type) were not. Specifically, studies reporting accuracy observed a marginal bilingual advantage (g = 0.10), but those reporting response times indicated a small monolingual benefit (g = -0.34). Therefore, there was little difference between monolingual and bilingual childrenâs performance on standardized auditory attention tests. We also found that studies tend to include a wide variety of bilingual children but report limited language background information of the participants. This, unfortunately, limits the potential theoretical contributions of the reviewed studies. Recommendations to improve the quality of future research are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (RGPIN-2019-06523).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Purpose Literacy precursors are cognitive, linguistic, and oral-language skills that predict future reading skills in children as young as 4 years. Speech-language pathologists and educators utilize these precursors as assessment tools to identify children at risk for reading difficulties. Most current tools are developed based on monolinguals (predominantly in English), despite the significant percentage of bilinguals globally. As such, bilingual children are typically assessed on tools developed for monolinguals in research and clinical settings. Despite this common practice, there is a lack of comprehensive synthesis on whether these precursors are a reliable indicator of reading skills in bilingual children. Our paper examines whether literacy precursors commonly used with monolinguals are associated with literacy development in simultaneous bilinguals.Method Following PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines, our review includes four databases (LLBA, ERIC, MLA, and PsycINFO), in addition to gray-literature and manual reference-list searches. To control for age of acquisition and language dominance variability, we included typically-developing simultaneous bilinguals exposed to both languages before age 3 (N=5,942). We analyzed reported statistical associations between code-related or oral-language precursors and reading outcome measures, using correlational meta-analyses.Results The 41 reports, that met inclusion/exclusion criteria, were published between 1977-2022. The average age at assessment was 7;5 years (range: 3;0 - 11;0 years), with children speaking over 21 bilingual language combinations. Our meta-analysis demonstrated significant within-language correlations and cross-language transfer effects for code-related (e.g., phonological awareness) and oral-language (e.g., vocabulary, morphological awareness) precursors. Semantic awareness, however, was not a reliable predictor in bilinguals.Conclusions Phonological awareness and vocabulary measures â even if originally developed for monolingual children - can form a meaningful component of early literacy assessment in simultaneous bilingual children: these precursors may be used as assessment tools across heritage and societal languages in research and clinical practice.

Participants were recruited through bilingual multicultural health staff and health care interpreter service staff and answered a question, âIn your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic?â Differences were explored by demographic variables. Freeâtext responses were thematically coded using the Content Analysis method.Results 707 people completed the survey, aged 18 to \&gt;70, 49\% males and 51\% females. Only 161 (23\%) of those surveyed reported any positive impacts. There were significant differences in the proportion of those who reported positives based on age (p=0.004), gender (p=0.013), language (p=0.003), health literacy (p=0.014), English language proficiency (p=0.003), education (p=\&lt;0.001) and whether participants had children less than 18 years at home (p=0.001). Reporting of positive impacts ranged from 12\% for people aged seventy years or older to 30\% for the 30â49-year age group. Reporting of positive impacts for different language groups ranged from 9\% to 42\%. 18\% of men reported positive impacts compared to 27\% of women, and 18\% of people with inadequate health literacy reported positive impacts compared to 26\% with adequate health literacy. Content Analysis of open-ended responses showed that, of those that did report positives, the top themes were âFamily timeâ (44\%), âImproved self-careâ (31\%) and, âGreater connection with othersâ (17\%).Conclusions From 21st March to July 9th, 2021, few surveyed participants reported finding any positives because of the COVIDâ19 pandemic. This finding is in stark contrast to related research in Australia in a population dominated by adults with English as their first language, carried out in June 2020, in which many more people experienced positives.So what The needs of people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds must inform future responses to community crises to facilitate an equitable effect of any collateral positives that may arise.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was not specifically funded.

	abstract = {Early evaluation of word reading skills is an important step in understanding and predicting childrenâs future literacy abilities. Traditionally, word reading evaluations are conducted using âstaticâ assessments (SA), which measure a childâs acquired knowledge and are prone to floor effects. Additionally, many of these tools are developed exclusively for English monolinguals, and therefore cannot be used equitably to evaluate the abilities of bilingual children. Dynamic assessment (DA), which evaluates the ability to learn a skill, is a potentially more equitable alternative. To establish that use of DAs is a valid alternative to traditional SAs, their concurrent agreement with gold standard SA measures and their predictive agreement with later word reading outcomes should be considered. In line with this, the primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the concurrent and predictive validity of DAs of word reading skills. Two secondary objectives are (i) to address which types of word reading DAs (phonological awareness, sound-symbol knowledge, or decoding) demonstrate the strongest relationships with equivalent concurrent static measures and later word reading outcomes, and (ii) to consider for which populations, defined by language status (monolingual vs. bilingual vs. mixed) and reading status (typically developing vs. at-risk vs. mixed) these DAs are valid. Thirty-four studies from 32 papers were identified through searching 5 databases, and the grey literature. Included studies provided a correlation between a DA and concurrent SA, or a DA and a later word reading outcome measure. Regarding concurrent validity, we observed a strong relationship between DAs and SAs in general (r=.60); however, subgroup analyses indicate that DAs of decoding (r=.54) and phonological awareness (r=.73) measures demonstrate greater strength of correlation with their static counterparts, compared to DAs of sound-symbol knowledge (r=.34). In terms of predictive validity, we observed a similarly strong relationship between DAs and word reading outcome measures (r=.57), independently of the type of measure. Subgroup analyses conducted based on participant language status suggested that there are significant differences between mean effect sizes for monolingual, bilingual and mixed language groups in terms of DAsâ concurrent validity with SAs, but no significant differences for predictive validity with word reading outcome measures. There were also no significant differences between mean effect sizes for at-risk, typically developing, or mixed groups in terms of DAs concurrent validity with SAs or predictive validity with word reading outcome measures.

	abstract = {Background Reading and language skills are important and known to be heritable, and dyslexia and developmental language disorder are commonly recognized learning difficulties worldwide. However, the genetic basis underlying these skills remains poorly understood. In particular, most previous genetic studies were performed on Westerners. To our knowledge, few or no previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on literacy skills in Chinese as a native language or English as a second language (ESL) in a Chinese population.Methods We conducted GWAS and related bioinformatics analyses on 34 reading/language-related phenotypes in Hong Kong Chinese bilingual children (including both twins and singletons; N=1046). We performed association tests at the single-variant, gene, pathway levels, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to explore how imputed expression changes might affect the phenotypes. In addition, we tested genetic overlap of these cognitive traits with other neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as cognitive performance (CP) and educational attainment (EA) using polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis.Results Totally 9 independent loci (LD-clumped at r2=0.01) reached genome-wide significance (p\&lt;5e-08) (filtered by imputation quality metric Rsq\&gt;0.3 and having at least 2 correlated SNPs(r2\&gt;0.5) with p\&lt;1e-3). The loci were associated with a range of language/literacy traits such as Chinese vocabulary, character and word reading, dictation and rapid digit naming, as well as English lexical decision. Several SNPs from these loci mapped to genes that were reported to be associated with intelligence, EA other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as MANEA, TNR, PLXNC1 and SHTN1. We also revealed significantly enriched genes and pathways based on SNP-based analysis. In PRS analysis, EA and CP showed significant polygenic overlap with a variety of language traits, especially English literacy skills. ADHD PRS showed a significant association with English vocabulary score.Conclusions This study revealed numerous genetic loci that may be associated with Chinese and English abilities in a group of Chinese bilingual children. Further studies are warranted to replicate the findings and elucidate the mechanisms involved.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partially supported by a Collaborative Research Fund (CRF) (C4054-17W) from the Research Grants Council.

	abstract = {Objective The current study examined patterns in COVID-19 testing and vaccination intentions across multiple language groups in Greater Western Sydney, Australia.Methods Participants completed a cross-sectional survey available from March 21 to July 9, 2021 in Sydney, Australia. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). Participants could complete surveys independently or with support from bilingual staff. Logistic regression models using post-stratification weighted frequencies identified factors associated with testing and vaccination intentions.Results Most of the 708 participants (88\%, n=622) were not born in Australia; 31\% reported that they did not speak English well or at all (n=220); 70\% had no tertiary qualifications (n=497); and 41\% had inadequate health literacy (n=290). Most participants reported high testing intention (77.2\%, n=546), with differences observed across language groups (p\&lt;0.001). The most frequently reported barrier to testing was concerns about infection at the clinic (26.1\%). Half (53.0\%) reported willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine if recommended to them (n=375); 18\% were unwilling (n=127), and the remainder unsure (29\%, n=205). These proportions varied significantly by language group (p\&lt;0.001). Participants were more likely to be unwilling/hesitant if they were female (p=0.02) or did not use Australian commercial information sources (p=0.01). Concerns about side effects (30.4\%, n=102) and safety (23.9\%, n=80), were key reported barriers to vaccination.Conclusion Different language groups have unique and specific needs to support uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Health services must work collaboratively with culturally and linguistically diverse communities to provide tailored support to encourage COVID-19 testing and vaccination.Lay summary708 adults living in Sydney, Australia, who did not speak English as their main language at home took part in a survey about COVID-19 vaccination and testing.Participants could complete the survey online (English/translated) or with support from bilingual staff. The survey was available in 11 languages.Three quarters of participants (77\%) reported they would get tested for COVID-19 if they had symptoms âno matter what.â The most common barrier was concern about getting infected at the testing clinic.53\% of participants reported that they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was recommended to them. 18\% reported that they wouldnât get the vaccine, and 29\% were unsure. The main barriers were concerns about vaccine side effects and safety.Intentions to get tested for COVID-19 or to get vaccinated varied significantly across language groups. Participants who were female, or who did not use Australian commercial information sources were more likely to be unwilling or unsure about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.Different language groups have unique and specific needs to support uptake of COVID-19 testing and vaccination.

	abstract = {Background In the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.Methods The 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged {\textgreater}=18 years) were included in the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.Results Age of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14\% were females, 37.43\% from Egypt, 36.86\%, from UAE, and 30\% were healthcare workers. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha {\textgreater}=0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total correlation (P\&lt;0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (\&lt;0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924, CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 \&amp; NFI=906).Conclusion the Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statementnon-applicableAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine-Alexandria University, Egypt (IRB No:00012098)All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Social factors are recognized determinants of morbidity and mortality and also have an impact on use of medical services. The objective of this study was to assess the associations of educational attainment, social and financial resources and migration factors with length of hospital stays for chronic conditions and to investigate the role of comorbidity and discharge destination in mediating these associations. The study made use of nationwide inpatient data that was linked with Swiss census data. The study sample included n=141,307 records of n=92,623 inpatients aged 25 to 84 years, hospitalized between 2010 and 2016 for a chronic condition. Cross-classified multilevel models were performed. Patients with upper secondary and compulsory education stayed longer in hospital compared to those with tertiary education (Î² 0.24 days, 95\% CI 0.14-0.33; Î² 0.37, 95\% CI 0.27-0.47, respectively) when taking into account demographic factors, main diagnosis and clustering on patient and hospital level. However, these effects were almost fully mediated by burden of comorbidity. The effect of living alone on length of stay (Î² 0.60 days, 95\% CI 0.50-0.70) was partially mediated by both burden of comorbidities (33\%) and discharge destination (30.4\%). (Semi-) private insurance was associated with prolonged stays, but an inverse effect was observed for colon and breast cancer. Allophone patients had also prolonged hospital stays (Î² 0.34, 95\% CI 0.13-0.55). Hospital stays could be a window of opportunity to discern patients who need additional time and support to better cope with everyday life after discharge, reducing the risks of future hospital stays. However, inpatient care in Switzerland seems to take into account rather obvious individual needs due to lack of immediate support at home, but not necessarily more hidden needs of patients with low health literacy and less resources to assert their interests within the health system.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the SNSF National Research Programme Smarter Health Care(NRP74), project number 4, grant number 407440\_167506, applicant LBO.

We assessed barriers to care and motivators to use at-home HPV self-sampling kits during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a randomized controlled trial evaluating kit effectiveness. Participants were women, aged 30-65 years and underscreened for cervical cancer in a safety-net healthcare system. We conducted telephone surveys in English/Spanish among a subgroup of trial participants, assessed differences between groups and determined statistical significance at p\&lt;0.05. Over half of 233 survey participants reported clinic-based screening (Pap) is uncomfortable (67.8\%), embarrassing (52.4\%), and discomfort seeing male providers (63.1\%). The latter two factors were significantly more prevalent among Spanish versus English speakers (66.4\% vs 30\% and 69.9 vs 52.2\%, respectively, p\&lt;0.01). Most women who completed the kit found Pap more embarrassing (69.3\%), stressful (55.6\%) and less convenient (55.6\%) than the kit. The first factor was more prevalent among Spanish versus English speakers (79.6\% vs 53.38\%, p\&lt;0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic influenced most (59.5\%) to participate in the trial due to fear of COVID, difficulty making appointments and ease of using kits.

The purpose of the current study is to translate the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire-Revised (WFQ-R) to the Arabic language and investigate its psychometric properties.Methods Two independent forward translations were performed by two native Arabic speakers; and then synthesized into one version. The synthesized version was back translated into English by two independent bilingual translators. An expert committee was formed to review the translation and adaptation process. A final Arabic version of the WFQ-R was obtained. In order to test the internal consistency, reliability, and validity of the Arabic WFQ-R, adult Arabic speakers were recruited to participate in this study.Results For the cross-cultural adaptation, only one item was changed in order to express its conceptual meaning. Analysis showed an absence of floor and ceiling effect for the Arabic WFQ-R. Results of construct validity showed that all items of the translated WFQ-R have one dimension. For internal consistency of the Arabic WFQ-R, Cronbachâs alpha was excellent (0.93). ICC values showed excellent test-retest reliability (0.94).

We developed GUÃA, a bi-lingual web-based platform that facilitates disclosure of GT results. The NYCKidSeq randomized controlled trial evaluated GUÃAâs impact on understanding of GT results. Methods: NYCKidSeq enrolled diverse children with neurologic, cardiac, and immunologic conditions who underwent GT. Families were randomized to genetic counseling with GUÃA (intervention) or standard of care (SOC) genetic counseling for results disclosure. Parents/legal guardians (participants) completed surveys at baseline, post-results disclosure, and 6-months later. Survey measures assessed the primary study outcomes of perceived understanding of and confidence in explaining their childâs GT results and the secondary outcome of objective understanding. We used regression models to evaluate the association between the intervention and the study outcomes. Results: The analysis included 551 participants, 270 in the GUÃA arm and 281 in SOC. Participantsâ mean age was 41.1 years and 88.6\% were mothers. Most participants were Hispanic/Latino(a) (46.3\%), White/European American (24.5\%), or Black/African American (15.8\%). Participants in the GUÃA arm had significantly higher perceived understanding post-results (OR=2.8, CI[1.004,7.617], P=0.049) and maintained higher objective understanding over time (OR=1.1, CI[1.004, 1.127], P=0.038) compared to those in the SOC arm. There was no impact on perceived confidence. Hispanic/Latino(a) individuals in the GUÃA arm maintained higher perceived understanding (OR=3.9, CI[1.6, 9.3], P=0.003), confidence (OR=2.7, CI[1.021, 7.277], P=0.046), and objective understanding (OR=1.1, CI[1.009, 1.212], P=0.032) compared to SOC . Conclusions: This trial demonstrates that GUÃA positively impacts understanding of GT results in diverse parents of children with suspected genetic conditions. These findings build a case for utilizing GUÃA to deliver complex and often ambiguous genetic results. Continued development and evaluation of digital applications in diverse populations are critical for equitably scaling GT offerings in specialty clinics.

	abstract = {Background Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder characterized by a consistent failure to speak in particular public settings despite speaking normally in other situations. However, quantitative SM research from China remains scanty at best. In response, this study aimed (1) to describe the sociodemographics and experiences of children and families with SM in China and (2) to identify sociodemographic and environmental correlates of SM in China.Methods This case-control mixed-methods study was composed of 172 cases with SM and 179 controls, recruited by online surveys. Multilevel logistic regression was performed to examine the association between potential correlates and SM.Results Only 51.2\% of SM cases were diagnosed by a professional, and 31.1\% of SM cases that received treatment were guided by a professional. Child SM was associated with: having two parents with an introverted personality (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 15.05, (95\% confidence interval (CI): 5.39 â 42.07), being born to a mothers aged {\textgreater}= 35 (AOR 6.44, 95\%CI: 1.24-33.43), and having a sibling (AOR 1.92, 95\% CI: 1.00 â 3.70). However, child SM was inversely associated with ever receiving bilingual (AOR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.10-0.39) education or being enrolled in an international school (AOR 0.12, 95\% CI 0.04-0.35).Conclusions Findings suggest that many children with SM in China have not received professional treatment or interventions. Hereditary and social environmental factors may be contributing to childhood onset of SM in China. Novel policies such as access to special education resources, SM-training for therapists, and school support are needed to enhance the early detection and treatment of SM in China.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding provided by Xiâan Jiaotong-Liverpool UniversityAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Xian Jiaotong Liverpool University University Ethics Committee (210243).I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Objectives Previous virtual care literature within the field of speech-language pathology has focused primarily on validating the virtual use of intervention programs. There are fewer articles addressing the validity of conducting standardized paediatric oral language and literacy assessments virtually. Additionally, there is a lack of practical recommendations available on how best to conduct these assessment measures virtually. Given the rapid rise in virtual care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers require guidance on best practices for virtual administration of these tools imminently.Methods We identified six key themes for recommendations based on two sources (1) our lab meeting discussions and (2) the outcomes of a narrative review of the extant literature. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with a group of 12 clinicians, students and researchers who had administered standardized language and literacy assessments with a variety of monolingual and multilingual school-aged children, with and without speech and language difficulties, in clinical and research settings to generate recommendations within these themes. Subsequently, in line with the Guidelines International Network, these recommendations were rated by group members, and reviewed by external stakeholders. A quasi-delphi consensus procedure was used to reach agreement on ratings for recommendations.Results We have developed recommendations for the use of standardized language and literacy assessments in virtual care, across six key themes: candidacy for virtual assessment, communication and collaboration with caregivers, technology and equipment, virtual administration, ethics, consent and confidentiality, and considerations for bilingual populations.Conclusions This paper is one of the first to share practical recommendations for virtual assessment in the domain of paediatric oral language and literacy assessment. We hope these recommendations will facilitate future clinical research and that as the body of research grows, that this paper will act as a basis for the development of formal Clinical Practice Guidelines.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study has been partially funded by the University of Toronto COVID-19 Student Engagement Award.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study has been approved by the Social Sciences, Humanities, and Education Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto (RIS Protocol Number: 38608).All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Repetitive head impacts (RHI) are associated with an increased risk of developing various neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimerâs disease (AD), Parkinsonâs disease (PD), and most notably, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). While the clinical presentation of AD and PD is well established, CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Therefore, a distinction can be made between the pathologically defined CTE and RHI-related functional or structural brain changes (RHI-BC) which may result in CTE. Unfortunately, there are currently no accepted biomarkers of CTE nor RHI-BC, a major hurdle to achieving clinical diagnoses. Interestingly, speech has shown promise as a potential biomarker of both AD and PD, being used to accurately classify individuals with AD and PD from those without. Given the overlapping symptoms between CTE, RHI-BC, PD and AD, we aimed to determine if speech could be used to identify individuals with a history of RHI from those without. We therefore created the Verus dataset, consisting of 13 second voice recordings from 605 professional fighters (RHI group) and 605 professional athletes in non-contact sports (control group) for a total of 1210 recordings. Using a deep learning approach, we achieved 85\% accuracy in detecting individuals with a history of RHI from those without. We then used our model trained on the Verus dataset to fine-tune on publicly available AD and PD speech datasets and achieved new state-of-the-art accuracies of 84.99\% on the AD dataset and 89\% on the PD dataset. Finding a biomarker of CTE and RHI-BC that presents early in disease progression is critical to improve risk management and patient outcome. Our study is the first we are aware of to investigate speech as such a candidate biomarker of RHI-BC.Competing Interest StatementM Ravanelli and CA Droppelmann declare no competing interests.

	abstract = {Objective India reported its first COVID-19 case in the state of Kerala and an outbreak initiated subsequently. The Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala, initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins for public awareness to control the spread of the disease. However, this unstructured data limits upstream applications, such as visualization, and analysis, thus demanding refinement to generate open and reusable datasets.Materials and Methods Through a citizen science initiative, we leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins and media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This was further visualized as a dashboard through a frontend web application and a JSON repository, which serves as an API for the frontend.Results From the sourced data, we provided real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. To ensure longevity and reusability, the dataset was deposited in an open-access public repository for future analysis. Finally, we provide outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 138 days of the outbreak.Discussion We anticipate that our dataset can form the basis for future studies, supplemented with clinical and epidemiological data from the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala.Conclusion We reported a citizen science initiative on the COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala to collect and deposit data in a structured format, which was utilized for visualizing the outbreak trend and describing demographic characteristics of affected individuals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was not funded by any agencies and was purely a voluntary effort during the community-wide quarantine period by a team of technologists, academicians, students, and the general public advocating open data and citizen science.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Since the data collected were publicly available, no individual consent and ethical approval were required for the study.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Health care providers (HCPs) have an important role in screening for alcohol use across the lifespan, particularly during the childbearing years, and providing brief intervention to yield optimal outcomes and prevent the potential teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure.Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the current alcohol screening practices of Canadian HCPs who care for pregnant women and women of childbearing age.Methods An online survey was administered in 2017 with the aim to identify current knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs among Canadian HCPs on screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol use for this population. The bilingual survey was disseminated by 4 national professional associations. A total of 634 interprofessional clinicians completed to the survey. Descriptive analysis was completed for the respondentâs profession and their practices related to alcohol SBIRT. Cross-tabulation analyses explored the use of different screening questionnaires.Results Most respondents reported asking about alcohol use; however, there was a low overall use of screening questionnaires for both women of childbearing age and those who are pregnant. Low screening rates may equate to missed opportunities for intervention. Low rates of brief intervention and referral were noted even in circumstances where at-risk drinking was identified, with only 16.4\% of respondents intervening when pregnant women reported at-risk alcohol consumption.Conclusion Continued efforts are needed to improve alcohol screening practices among womenâs HCPs across Canada. Priority areas for training include: understanding validated alcohol screening questionnaires; incorporating brief intervention into routine care; and developing local referral pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research was supported by a Public Health Agency of Canada contribution agreement.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Background: The Australian Government implemented a range of public health response strategies and communication approaches to reduce the spread of COVID-19; however, concerns have been raised around a failure to consider culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) communities sufficiently in these processes. This research aimed to understand the factors that have impacted COVID-19 communication and engagement efforts during the pandemic from the perspective of key CaLD community stakeholders and community members. A further aim was to understand the processes that could be adopted to support future communication strategies, including the promotion of pandemic-related vaccines. Approach: This study included 29 key informant interviews with community and faith-based leaders in New South Wales, Australia. Result(s): The overwhelming message from community leaders was a sense of shared responsibility between their organisations and the government in communicating pertinent and accurate COVID-19 related information to CaLD communities. They expressed a sense of duty to keep their community members safe. While acknowledging this shared responsibility, community leaders and others shouldered significant costs related to resources and time that need to be acknowledged by governments in preparing for future disease outbreaks. They felt that governments should consider: 1) improving communication between governments and CaLD organisations; 2) responding to the specific CaLD needs with greater agility; 3) foregrounding social media in their communication strategy; 4) reinvesting in local public health units to know their population; 5) investing in a health ambassadors model program; 6) preparing a hybrid model of translators/interpreters to fill the gap; and, 7) reimagining vaccine information campaigns to better target CaLD communities. Conclusion(s): Given the technical details about the COVID-19 virus conveyed in government information campaigns and the media, ensuring the most vulnerable populations, including people from CaLD backgrounds, access clear, concise and timely public health messaging from both governments and community organisations requires further attention.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Two interventions had PrEP-related outcomes whereas 7 focused on behavioral (e.g., condoms, testing) and/or educational outcomes. Few studies used digital health. All but one study was theoretically guided. Community engagement was a common and important thread in the included studies, with community-based participatory research being the most prevalent framework. The inclusion of cultural factors varied widely, as did the availability of Spanish language or bilingual study materials. Future research opportunities are discussed and recommendations to bolster HIV prevention interventions (e.g., tailoring) are presented.

	abstract = {Objective: In response to the question 'how can teachers develop health literacy events that leverage students' cultural and linguistic resources', this study highlights how two teachers developed a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum that sought to promote health literacy. Design(s): The study details findings from a larger partnership between an urban university and a bilingual urban school in the USA. Researchers and teachers conducted a year-long project oriented towards co-designing a curriculum that integrated students' cultural and linguistic repertoires with health literacy. Over one academic year, teachers planned, implemented, studied and modified curricular units that drew on students' cultural and linguistic resources related to health. Setting(s): The study focuses on two Spanish-English bilingual teachers working in a third-grade (8-9 year olds) dual-language classroom in a multilingual urban community in the midwestern USA. Method(s): Data collected included classroom conversations, teacher-researcher and university researcher conversations, classroom work and teacher-derived analytic documents. Data were coded and analysed to understand how teachers made sense of what happened within specific health literacy events to develop a single descriptive case study. Result(s): Three events are focused on demonstrating how teachers developed health literacy by building on students' pre-existing cultural and linguistic resources. Teachers moved from using teacher-centred forms of nutrition education to using student-developed health content that articulated with health concerns in the community. Conclusion(s): Using a funds of knowledge approach to integrating health literacy into the curriculum, teachers helped students draw on cultural and linguistic resources, building self-confidence, and developing an interest in gathering evidence and presenting health-related findings.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Intro: Uptake of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RATs) for self-testing has been high following authorisation by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). However, there are no published Australian data assessing feasibility and compliance with home-based rapid antigen testing. The aim of this study was to determine the acceptability of daily rapid antigen self-testing. Method(s): We prospectively recruited a cohort of hospital employees and students from primary and secondary school to perform daily self-testing using RATs in the home over 14 consecutive days. Participants consenting to the study were supplied with 15 Roche SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Nasal Self Tests, 3 saliva swabs for self-collection for RT-PCR and were asked to record results and answer a daily survey using a smartphone application. Finding(s): 38\% (26/68) of the cohort were compliant to 14 consecutive days of testing; this was significantly higher in students (71\%) than hospital employees (28\%). The median number of tests performed over 14 consecutive days was 11 and time to first missed test was a median 5.5 days. The most common reasons for missing days were "I forgot" (37.5\%) and "too busy" (8.9\%). Ease of self- nasal swabbing, self-nasal testing. performing the test and using the app were rated as comfortable/very comfortable in over 80\% of the cohort. Discussion(s): Most study participants in this Australian cohort were compliant with frequent home-based RATs. By study end most participants (93.8\%) found the testing process acceptable/very acceptable. There is need for further work on the cost-effectiveness and impact of self-tested RATs under a range of specific uses and conditions. Conclusion(s): This study provided valuable information on acceptability and feasibility of regular home-based testing which could be applied to other diseases. Ongoing community engagement with clear information on RATs including accuracy and use cases is important for decision-making and addressing concerns, particularly for linguistically diverse peoples.Copyright Â© 2023},

	doi = {10.1111/hex.13703},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Internationally, cultural factors are associated with vaccine uptake and completion in ethnic minority communities. Whilst Australia has achieved high human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, little is known about how culture or ethnicity influences HPV vaccination engagement. To address these gaps, we partnered with our Local Health District to explore how one culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community engages with school and HPV vaccination. METHOD(S): We adapted a participatory research method (the World Cafe) to engage one local CALD community-the Macedonian community (Our bi-cultural researcher and participants preferred the term 'Macedonia' rather than The Republic of North Macedonia as outlined in the 2018 Prespa agreement) in New South Wales (Australia)-to discuss HPV and school vaccination. Our qualitative analysis combined deductive codes taken from the Tailoring Immunization Programme framework, inductive codes guided by narrative inquiry (temporality, sociality and place) and previously known vaccination 'trust' frameworks. RESULT(S): In late 2019, 31 local Macedonian community members were purposely recruited for two World Cafes (n=15 mothers/grandmothers and n=16 young adults). Our themes reveal a community narrative grounded in historical vaccine experiences, family views on vaccination and a general trust in schools. Participants collectively discussed how 'increasing knowledge' and 'tailoring health communications' could strengthen community vaccine decision-making. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates how research partnerships and participatory methods can be applied in CALD community settings to research engagement with school and HPV vaccination. Our World Cafe dialogues highlight a positive narrative about vaccines, where community vaccination behaviours were built on multilayer trust relationships despite low vaccine knowledge. Our findings further knowledge around 'public trust' in school vaccination, highlighting the importance of existing (or missing) trust relationships when tailoring vaccine communication to local CALD communities. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Participants who took part in the World Cafes were all local Macedonian community parents or young adults who have been or will be exposed to the health services offered by school-based HPV vaccination. Thus, all the data collected came from their personal experiences with the school vaccination programme, or how they expect to participate in the programme. To ensure our study design was culturally appropriate and tailored to the Macedonian community, we engaged with the relevant local health stakeholders (the bi-cultural Multicultural Health Officer and Multicultural Health Service Manager Programme Director) to adapt and refine the World Cafe method for this context and setting. Our local health stakeholders also reviewed our preliminary findings, assisted with data interpretation and participated in manuscript editing.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

	volume = {28},
	doi = {10.1111/resp.14460},
	abstract = {Introduction/Aim: Social factors contribute significantly to asthma burden. This is particularly true for CALD groups where non-medical factors negatively impact their health. Improving health requires addressing systems issues based on understanding connections between social, culture and health domains. Method(s): This ethnographic participatory design project entailed (1) training of bi-cultural workers from three cultural groups as research assistants to discover the barriers and enablers to their communities' health ('systems maps'), (2) a structured process to determine priority audience 'readiness', and therefore selection, and (3) co-design of solutions with the priority audience. Results were analysed using a mixed methods approach focusing on relevance and appropriateness, effectiveness and acceptability, sustainability and acceptability, and efficiency. Efficiency was evaluated by a 'social return on investment' (SROI) analysis. Result(s): The project engaged 184 community members and 15 community pharmacists. The system effects analysis was a critical part of understanding the factors contributing to illness/wellbeing, and this was validated by the respective communities in follow up debriefing sessions. It demonstrated that culture is more important than condition for these groups in determining health impacts. The Arabic speaking community was considered most ready to participate in solution design and implementation. The selected community pharmacy intervention focused on cultural competence and included an interactive session between pharmacy and community on the basics of chronic disease. 97\% of Arabic speakers agreed that the session helped their understanding of the role of community pharmacy in their health. 92\% agreed that the session instilled trust. The SROI was estimated to be \$0.7. Conclusion(s): Systems mapping is an effective tool to identify issues that influence health outcomes. Codesigned health interventions that address these issues are likely to be both successful and impactful among culturally diverse communities. Conversely, interventions which are naive of the systems influences of diverse communities are prone to failure.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Gestational diabetes and overweight during pregnancy are associated with future type 2 diabetes. Postpartum weight loss can reduce diabetes risk. However, effective interventions for postpartum weight loss are lacking, in particular for Latina populations, despite their disproportionate burdens of gestational diabetes, overweight, and diabetes. Study design: This was a community-based RCT. Setting/participants: Researchers recruited pregnant individuals with gestational diabetes or BMI{\textgreater}25 kg/m2 from safety-net health care settings and Women, Infants, and Children offices in Northern California in 2014-2018. Of 180 individuals randomized to intervention (n=89) or control (n=91), 78\% identified as Latina, 61\% were primarily Spanish speaking, and 76\% perceived their diabetes risk to be low. Intervention(s): The intervention consisted of a 5-month postpartum telephone-based health coaching intervention delivered in English or Spanish. Main Outcome Measure(s): Data were collected through surveys at enrollment and 9-12 months after delivery and chart review up to 12 months after delivery. The primary outcome, weight change from prepregnancy to 9-12 months after delivery, was compared between the groups, overall and within strata defined a priori according to language (Spanish or English) and diabetes risk perception (none/slight or moderate/high). Result(s): The intent-to-treat estimated intervention effect was +0.7 kg (95\% CI= -2.4 kg, +3.8 kg; p=0.67). In stratified analyses, intervention effects remained nonsignificant but varied in direction: effects were favorable among English speakers and those with higher perceived diabetes risk, and unfavorable among Spanish speakers and those with lower perceived risk. Analyses were conducted in 2021-2022. Conclusion(s): A postpartum health coaching intervention, designed for low-income Latina women at increased risk for diabetes, did not reduce postpartum weight gain. Intervention effects were nonsignificantly more favorable among English speakers versus Spanish speakers, and among those who perceived their diabetes risk to be high versus low.

	abstract = {Background: Effective family-school partnerships can improve outcomes for autistic students. Yet, we know little about what effective partnerships look like for parents of autistic children from different cultural backgrounds, especially in an Australian context. Here, we provide insight into the first-hand experiences of Vietnamese parents living in Australia as they navigated education for their autistic children. Method(s): Using participatory methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Vietnamese parents of autistic children (3 - 18 years) attending Australian kindergarten/schools to understand their experiences of parent-teacher interactions. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified three key themes and associated subthemes. Result(s): Parent priorities were caregiving and their children's education. They were clearly respectful of, and deferential towards, teachers and were also concerned about the potential repercussions of advocating for their children. Parents expressed gratitude for what Australia afforded them, often feeling undeserving of additional supports. Not being proficient in English was challenging, especially during periods of pandemic-related remote learning. Stigma and discrimination were commonly experienced, especially towards mothers. Despite challenges, parents fought for what they felt was best for their children, but this advocacy took its toll with stress, exhaustion and isolation frequently described. Culturally-specific services were a key source of assistance. Conclusion(s): This work has implications for how teachers and schools can foster successful relationships with Vietnamese parents of autistic children. Recommendations for schools include supporting families' language preferences, explicitly scaffolding parent advocacy training as well as student self-advocacy strategies and ensuring that the wellbeing of both children and parents is prioritised by schools.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Racial/ethnic minority communities are underrepresented in research. Medical mistrust and mistreatment, discrimination, and a lack of diverse research workforce may influence recruitment and engagement. Engaging Latinx immigrants for research presents unique recruitment challenges, especially for biobehavioral research which is not well explored. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of targeted strategies for recruiting young adult, Latinx immigrants. Method(s): Recruitment occurred from 2018 to 2019 in an ongoing, longitudinal, community-engaged research study examining risk and resilience factors for health outcomes in Latinx immigrants. Strategies included active recruitment (e.g., community-based events and public events) and passive recruitment (e.g., word-of-mouth and radio and flyer advertisements). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of type of recruitment on participant enrollment. Result(s): The study enrolled 391 participants of 701 interested individuals (55\%). Greater odds of enrollment were among participants recruited through radio and flyer advertisements (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.90, 95\%CI [1.59, 5.27], p=.001), word-of-mouth (AOR=2.50, 95\% CI [1.55, 4.03], p{\textless}.000), or community-based organization events (AOR=1.68, 95\% CI [1.19, 2.38], p=.003). Conclusion(s): Passive recruitment strategies through trusted sources increased the odds of enrollment of Latinx immigrants in biobehavioral research. Future recruitment efforts should leverage trusted sources to disseminate recruitment materials addressing barriers to recruiting Latinx participants for research.},

The authors share a collaboration between a nonprofit immunization coalition and college of pharmacy to provide mobile coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination clinics to communities across Idaho that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The goal of this commentary is to share experiences providing vaccination services for the Hispanic community and discuss strategies for pharmacy professionals to provide more equitable care. Through clinical experience and listening sessions to address vaccine hesitancy, several themes emerged that could be categorized into the following: convenience, complacency, and confidence. Suggestions to overcome vaccine hesitancy include hosting events at work sites, bilingual communication techniques, targeted education, and collaboration with trusted community partners. Additional considerations in implementing more equitable care include creating a culturally competent workforce, combatting vaccine misinformation, and finding sustainable ways to continue community partnerships to provide ongoing and expanding services. Utilizing unique approaches to serve the stated needs of a Hispanic population is essential to providing equitable health care to all members of a community.Copyright Â© 2022},

These challenges were acknowledged by community members even after a long residence in Australia The data generated on the beliefs about mental health issues and consequent help-seeking behaviours highlight the importance of culturally sensitive targeted prevention and early intervention strategies and ongoing commitment to building mental health literacy in the wider community WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: The information from the study can be adapted for quality improvement and culturally responsive practices The strategies for effective service delivery drawn by this paper can be a comprehensive resource tool for mental health professionals, organisations and policymakers The findings imply that CALD mental health service users and their families will likely benefit from improved service assessment and quality of mental health care and equity when MHNs undertake cultural competence training and bring that into their practice. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Victoria is one of the most multicultural states in Australia. Many CALD communities in Victoria may have encountered complicated migration journeys and complex life stressors during their initial settlement, leading to adverse mental health concerns. This diversity necessitates public policy settings to ensure equity and access in health services planning and delivery. While the MH policies and services take cultural diversity into account, there needs to be more implementation of those components of MH policies that relate to the particular needs of various CALD communities in Victoria. Even though mental health services prevent and address mental health issues, many barriers can impair CALD community access and utilisation of mental health services. Furthermore, the recent Royal Commission inquiry into the Victorian Mental Health system drives a renewed policy imperative to ensure meaningful engagement and cultural safety of all people accessing and utilising mental health services (Department of Health, 2023). AIM: This study focused on the perspectives of people from CALD communities in Victoria regarding their mental health service needs, understandings of and experiences with mental health services to prepare an education package for mental health nurses as part of a larger multi-method research project. METHOD(S): A qualitative descriptive design was used to collect and analyse the perspectives of 21 participants in Victoria, using telephone interviews, followed by thematic analysis. RESULT(S): The themes and sub-themes identified were: Settling issues; Perceptions of understanding of mental health issues (help-seeking attitudes toward mental health issues; the need for CALD community education); perceived barriers to accessing and utilising mental health services in Victoria (socio-cultural and language barriers; stigma, labelling and discrimination; knowledge and experience of accessing health facilities); experience with mental health services and professionals. DISCUSSION: Community participation, mental health professional education and robust research regarding the mental health needs of CALD people are some of the recommended strategies to improve access and utilisation of mental health services in Victoria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The current study can contribute to the existing knowledge, understanding, practice and quality improvement as it vividly portrays the issues of various CALD communities in Victoria. The findings of this study imply that CALD MH service users and their families are likely to benefit in terms of improved service assessment and quality of MH care and equity when MHNs undertake CC training and bring that into their practice.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Stop the Bleed (STB), and other trainings that promote health education in basic trauma management techniques, is offered mostly in English and Spanish in the United States. Limited access to injury prevention training may contribute to inequities in health outcomes for individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). Our study aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of STB training in 4 languages spoken in a super diverse refugee settlement community, Clarkston, GA. Method(s): Written STB educational materials were culturally adapted, translated, and back translated into 4 languages: Arabic, Burmese, Somali, and Swahili. Four 90-minute in-person STB trainings were conducted by medical personnel with community-based interpreters at a central and familiar location in the Clarkston community. Pre- and post-tests were administered in participant's preferred language to evaluate change in knowledge and beliefs as well as the effectiveness of the training method. Result(s): A total of 46 community members were trained in STB, the majority of which were women (63\%). Participants demonstrated improvement in their knowledge, confidence, and comfort using STB techniques. Participants reported that 2 aspects of the training were particularly beneficial: the presence of language concordant interpreters from the community and small group hands on sessions that allowed for practicing STB techniques. Conclusion(s): Cultural and linguistic adaptation of STB training is a feasible, cost-effective, and effective method for disseminating life-saving information and trauma education to immigrant populations who have LEP. Expansion of community training and partnerships to support the needs of diverse communities is both necessary and urgent.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: Knowledge gained through cancer clinical trials (CTs) has been proven critical to preventing, diagnosing and treating the disease, and providing the evidence base for clinical practice. Major advances in cancer treatment, which are essential for improving patients' outcomes, come from investigations of new therapeutic agents in CTs. Despite the large number of available studies and improvements in public awareness about CTs, participation of underrepresented minorities in clinical research has been persistently low, with only 2 to 5\% of Latinos and African Americans participating in cancer treatment trials. Barriers to participation are multilevel, complex, and multifactorial, including study design, healthcare system barriers, and patient-and medical team-related factors. Structural inequities, social determinants of health, distrust of government, patient-doctor communication, cultural and language barriers, and lower levels of health literacy have all been cited as common barriers for Latino and African American populations. Purpose(s): To improve informed decision-making about cancer CT participation among cancer patients and community members through a bilingual multilevel, multi-communication approach, including 1) a randomized controlled educational trial (clinic-based settings), and 2) a community education module (community-based settings). We will assess the impact of the intervention on awareness, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to consider CTs as an appropriate treatment option for cancer and improve CT participation rates. Method(s): The clinical setting includes a 2-group, parallel, randomized study with 400 patients from the Mays Cancer Center. The intervention group receives 1) a bilingual educational video on CTs, 2) a low literacy booklet, 3) support from a patient navigator (PN), and 4) an invitation to join our Salud America! network providing online/social media CT information. The control group receives a general fact sheet on CTs. All healthcare providers involved in clinical research will participate in Webinars to raise awareness of implicit bias and the importance of inclusive research. The community-setting intervention features a prospective singlegroup pre/post design, where participants (400) act as their own controls. They will receive an educational session on CTs provided by a community health educator + a low literacy booklet. Result(s): Focus groups guided the development of the video script, booklet, and educational materials. The short video features real cancer patients sharing their experience with CTs and how they overcame common barriers. Patient recruitment starts in August 2022. Preliminary results will be presented. Conclusion(s): Multilevel interventions involving culturally tailored decision aids (i.e., online video, low literacy booklet) in combination with care coordination by a PN can effectively address common barriers influencing patient decision-making regarding CTs, raise awareness, and increase positive attitudes and CT participation among specific groups with low participation in clinical research.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affect young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women of colour. We explored the experiences of community-based peer navigators ('Community Navigators') who participated in Impact Triad, a bilingual multilevel intervention developed by our community-based participatory research partnership to reduce STIs and HIV and address social determinants of health (e.g., employment, education, social support and discrimination) among young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. METHOD(S): Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 Community Navigators who participated in Impact Triad. Themes were identified through constant comparison. RESULT(S): Community Navigators' mean age was 31.4 years. Seven were self-identified as African American/Black, 5 as Latine, 2 as multiracial/multiethnic, 1 as Asian American, 10 as cisgender men, 4 as transgender women and 1 as gender nonbinary. Thirteen themes emerged in three domains: (1) key aspects of the Community Navigator role (e.g., desire to serve as a community resource, the importance of being part of the communities in which one was working, the value of having an official role, being connected to other Community Navigators to problem-solving and sustaining intervention aspects long-term); (2) experiences implementing Impact Triad (e.g., engaging community members, meeting prioritized needs, building trust, using social media, increasing awareness and knowledge and challenges related to COVID-19) and (3) lessons learned for future interventions (e.g., facilitating access to broader resources, building additional skills and increasing interactions among Community Navigators). CONCLUSION(S): Interviews identified important learnings about serving as Community Navigators and implementing Impact Triad that can guide future efforts to address STI/HIV disparities and social determinants of health through community-based peer navigation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Throughout this intervention trial, our partnership worked collaboratively with a study-specific community advisory board (CAB) comprised primarily of young GBMSM and transgender women of colour. Members of this CAB participated in all aspects of the trial including trial design, intervention development, recruitment and retention strategies, data collection and analysis, interpretation of findings and dissemination.Copyright Â© 2023 The Authors.

A Community Advisory Team (CAT) of parents, advocates, community interpreters and translators, researchers, and teachers explored CLD families' experiences and advocacy efforts. Critical bifocality and circuits of dispossession, privilege, and resistance informed the documentation of inequities and resistance to understand the linkages of structural arrangements of power. Focus groups with families (n=21) speakers of Spanish, Portuguese, and Cantonese were conducted. Findings indicate perceived discrimination, poor and inadequate interpretation and translation services impact children's access to special education services, hinder family's communication with schools and reduce the perceptions of schools as trustworthy institutions. Families advocate relentlessly for their children and recommend schools listen to families and hire culturally and linguistically competent interpreters and translators.

	abstract = {Effective parent-teacher partnerships can improve outcomes for autistic students. Yet, we know little about what effective partnerships look like for parents of autistic children from diverse backgrounds. Using participatory methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Somali mothers of autistic children attending Australian kindergartens/schools to understand experiences of parent-teacher interactions. We used reflexive thematic analysis to identify key themes. We found that mothers were proud and accepting of their children. They had high expectations, particularly around children's independence. Mothers wished their children's differences were understood and supported by other people, including teachers. They were frustrated by low expectations of children, a lack of genuine communication from teachers and limited autism-specific knowledge, skills and experience within schools. They described racist attitudes towards their children and reported that they themselves had experienced stigma. They also had few sources of support to rely upon, although their non-autistic daughters and their faith were important foundations for resilience. Despite all of these challenges, mothers themselves were increasing community awareness and knowledge about autism in the hope that they and their children would be valued by others. Our work has implications for how teachers and schools can foster successful relationships with Somali parents of autistic children. Lay abstract: Good relationships between parents and schools can improve autistic children's school success. There are many reasons why families from different cultural backgrounds find it harder to develop good relationships with schools, such as language barriers, discrimination and unfamiliarity with education systems. We know little about what 'good relationships' look like for these families. Here, we worked with a team of autistic and non-autistic researchers as well as an Advisory Group of Somali parents to conduct interviews with 15 Somali mothers of kindergarten and school-age autistic children. We asked mothers about their experiences of their child's education, communication with teachers and what a good relationship with schools would look like. We also asked how they felt the Somali community understood autism. We looked for common things that mothers said. We found that mothers were very proud of their children. They had high expectations, particularly about what children could do by themselves. Mothers found it frustrating that teachers had low expectations, that schools were not good at communicating with them and that autism-specific skills and experience were uncommon in schools. They also reported racist attitudes towards their children. Mothers experienced stigma and lacked resources, but support was gained from their daughters and their religion. Mothers themselves were proactively increasing community awareness and knowledge about autism in the hope that they and their autistic children would be valued and better supported. Our work has implications for how teachers and schools can work together with Somali parents to forge better futures for autistic children.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Wisconsin with higher mortality rates observed for Black/African American (B/AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) communities. However, programs tailored to the interests of communities most impacted by cancer AND made available to the general population are lacking. In this project, we adapted the Moving Forward program for African American cancer survivors which included a program workbook, in-person education/supervised exercise classes and text messaging. We targeted two adaptations to inform a cancer prevention program available to the public through a public recreation system: 1) tailoring to include non-cancer affected individuals and 2) extending to meet the needs of the H/L community. Methods. This project was facilitated through partnerships between an academic cancer center, the Milwaukee public recreation system (MKE Rec) and the WI Department of Health and Human Services. We also engaged a community advisory board (CAB). Our approach comprised focus groups, surveys collected at community events, and an After-Action Review of a 4-week program pilot (2 groups, English or Spanish language). Translation was conducted using a forward/back translation process with workbook review by individuals from different Spanish language backgrounds. Our CAB contributed to the development and review of all study procedures and materials. Result(s): 42 H/L community members participated through two focus groups (1 English language, [N=4]), 1 Spanish language (N=6)], 16 surveys, and 16 pilot participants (N=9 Spanish language, N=7 English language). Adaptations targeted program content and materials, as well as program implementation/sustainability within MKE Rec. Program adaptations included: 1) integrating information on basic cancer biology; 2) explaining associations between cancer, lifestyle and other risk factors; 3) adding cancer screening information; 4) including cooking demonstrations and recipes with culturally relevant tips; 5) updating workbook images and content to reflect the diversity of local communities; and 6) addressing comorbidity risk. Key adaptations related to conducting and sustaining within a public recreation system included: 1) creating a standardized instructor training and manual; 2) dividing the program into two 8-week sessions to meet the public recreation system program calendar; 3) eliminating the text message component; 4) providing the program workbook and classes in English and Spanish; and 5) integrating different exercise approaches to meet needs/interests of different age groups, genders, and different fitness levels. The adapted program, Total Wellness/Bienestar Total, is now offered as the first ever Spanish language wellness class within MKE Rec. Conclusion(s): Community-academic partnerships and ongoing community engagement led to meaningful adaptations to a cancer prevention and lifestyle program. These efforts leverage a public resource and can impact disparities by making widely available cancer prevention and lifestyle support.},

	volume = {365},
	doi = {10.1016/S0002-9629%2823%2900195-7},
	abstract = {Purpose of Study: Amarillo has a culturally diverse refugee population. An estimated 4000 refugees have been accommodated by the US Refugee Resettlement Program with the help of Refugee Services of Texas and Catholic Charities as of December 2016. The Texas Tech faculty, medical students, and volunteers in association with local charities operate a bi-weekly introductory health screening clinic at the Amarillo International Market. The main barrier to this program is the language diversity the health care personnel face in communicating with the refugees and integrating them into the health care system. Methods Used: An exploratory qualitative design with a community-based research approach was adopted. The research team consisted of health care providers, medical students, and volunteers. The objective was to study the barriers to healthcare access among immigrants with limited or no English language proficiency. Volunteer groups screened 143 new refugees attending Amarillo Refugee Health Screening Project and 2-3 interpreters from the community to assist in translation services from December 2021 to March 2022. Summary of Results: Thematic analysis of healthcare providers and immigrants specified that limited language proficiency frequently delayed access to available healthcare services and interfered with developing a therapeutic relationship between the immigrant and the healthcare provider. Based on data collected from the Amarillo Refugee clinic, 72\% of the refugees spoke the primary foreign language like Farsi, Arabic, Pashto. Approximately 54\% had some English knowledge; however inadequate to communicate with the health care providers effectively. Conclusion(s): Immigrants from culturally diverse backgrounds live in Amarillo, Texas, with many challenges during the resettlement phase, influencing their access to healthcare services and health outcomes. The "Healthy Immigrant Effect" is when the immigrants arrive in the host nation, and their health is observed to deteriorate with increased length of stay in the host country is likely a possibility for the refugee population in Amarillo. Language barriers interfered with treatment adherence and the use of preventative and screening services, further delaying access to timely care, causing poor chronic disease management, and ultimately resulting in poor health outcomes. Language barriers also impeded effective communication between healthcare providers and the immigrants, leading to suboptimal care and dissatisfaction with the care received. Involving community interpreters, family members, or volunteers from within the immigrant population is being suggested as a solution to overcome the communication barriers to reduce the Healthy Immigrant effect.Copyright Â© 2023 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jgo.2022.04.009},
	abstract = {Background: Due to various socio-cultural and language related factors, healthcare providers experience barriers when communicating with older culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients with cancer, which can lower the quality of care received by patients and negatively impact healthcare providers. Studies focusing on communication barriers of older CALD patients with cancer and a systematic comparison of those barriers between different healthcare providers have been largely missing. Objective(s): In order to lay out the healthcare providers' perceived barriers to communication, the present study identified and compared communication barriers among different healthcare providers when caring for older CALD patients with cancer. Method(s): An online survey was conducted among healthcare providers in the Netherlands who identified as being involved in the care of CALD patients with cancer (N = 191), specifically; GPs (NGPs = 54), specialists (Nspecialists = 29), oncology nurses (Nnurses = 77), and pharmacists (Npharmacists = 31). Providers assessed twelve pre-specified factors on (i) importance and (ii) frequency of these factors as barriers to communication. A composite score by employing the QUOTE (Quality Of care Through the patients' Eyes) methodology was used to rank, and classify factors as either potential or influential barriers. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Overall, low Dutch language proficiency of older CALD patients with cancer, family interpreters providing inadequate translations, not knowing the extent of patients' informational needs, cultural differences in views about healthcare (i.e., illnesses and treatments) and family members blocking communication were found to be influential communication barriers. Healthcare providers showed several differences in what they perceived to be a potential or an influential barrier: Cultural differences in views about healthcare and patients getting treatment in their home countries were important barriers for GPs, while not knowing the patient's contact person was for pharmacists. Nurses perceived the highest number of influential barriers, while specialists perceived the least. We conclude that specific interventions that address differences in perceived barriers among providers are needed, and we highlight potential interventions that involve digital communication tools, such as the Conversation Starter.Copyright Â© 2022},

In this highly collaborative, mixed methods, participatory action research, Balanda (the Yolnu word for non-Aboriginal people) and Yolnu researchers conducted cycles of transcription and analysis of a language sample, with oral group discussions to identify which words to include, omit, or add, based on Yolnu perceptions of the structure and use of their languages. A Yolnu metaphor, Gulaka-buma ("Harvesting yams"), was identified by Yolnu researchers to represent and share the research process and findings. Three key themes were identified that summarize the main cultural and linguistic considerations related to changes made to the core vocabulary. Study findings emphasized the role of language as an expression of culture and identity for Indigenous peoples and the importance of considering cultural and linguistic factors in selecting vocabulary for AAC systems.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Despite evidence that Hispanic/Latino populations are 1.5 times more likely than non-Latino Whites to develop Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), Latinos are underrepresented in clinical trials testing treatments for ADRD. Data are needed on facilitators of ADRD clinical trial participation in Latinos. We leveraged in-depth qualitative methods to elucidate barriers and facilitators to participating in ADRD clinical trials in a large and diverse sample of Latinos; and to provide timely and actionable strategies to accelerate representation of Latinos in clinical trials on ADRD. Method(s): Data were collected in California between January 2019 and June 2020 from 25 focus groups (FGs): eight with Latino adults ages 18 to 49 (n = 54), nine with Latino adults ages 50+ (n = 75), and eight with caregivers of Latino older adults with ADRD (n = 52). Twelve community-based organization administrators were also interviewed. Transcripts of FGs and interviews were entered into Atlas.ti software. Three independent team members analyzed the transcripts with inductive/deductive qualitative content analysis. We triangulated data from stakeholder groups across sites, we used collaborative coding, and used the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Result(s): An overarching theme was a tension between wanting to learn more about ADRD and to participate in ADRD research but having limited awareness and opportunity. Five themes were identified: (1) remaining in limbo, (2) wanting information about ADRD, (3) wanting information on research about ADRD, (4) clearing researchers through trusted local organizations, and (5) practicing altruism through engagement in research opportunities. Discussion(s): To increase representation of Latino communities in clinical trials on ADRD, bilingual information and education on ADRD and clinical trials needs to be better disseminated. Also, working with trusted local, regional, and national organizations can increase participation. Importantly, Latino participation can increase when research teams demonstrate altruistic actions and inform participants of public health reasons requiring their involvement. HIGHLIGHTS: Participation in clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is limited among Latinos/Hispanics. Knowing the high prevalence of ADRD in Latinos increases willingness to participate. Observing altruism from researchers increases willingness to participate. Invitations from multiple organizations increases willingness to participate. Researchers should include public health reasons requiring Latinos' involvement.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

This topic is particularly poorly understood among French-speaking official language minority 2SLGBTQ+populations in Canada. Hence, this study was conducted to generate insights into their needs and experiences, through the lens of intersectionality. This quantitative community-based study, a first of its kind in Western Canada, describes the sociodemographic profile, experiences of discrimination and stigmatisation, and needs and challenges pertaining to mental health and social supports of this double minority group. Data were obtained by an online survey conducted in the Canadian province of Manitoba in June 2020. The participant sample was largely homogenous: most were under the age of 55years, white, educated, and from urban areas. Many reported experiencing dual marginalisation, feeling unaccepted by both of their minority communities (Francophone and 2SLGBTQ+). A sense of isolation, as well as a lack of social connectedness and psychological support, were often reported. Social initiatives and mental health support within environments proactively affirming of the official language of the minority and inclusive of diverse 2SLGBTQ+identities are needed.},

Although Indigenous communities experience disproportionate rates of mental health problems, research supporting language and spirituality's role in improving mental health is under-researched and poorly understood. METHOD(S): Data for this study are from a Community-based Participatory Research Project involving five Anishinaabe tribes in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Participants were sampled from clinic records of adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, living on or near the reservation, and self-identifying as American Indian (mean age = 46.3; n = 191). RESULT(S): Structural equation modeling illustrates that language use in the home is associated with positive mental health through spiritual connectedness. CONCLUSION(S): Results support tribal community expressions of the positive effects of cultural involvement for Indigenous wellbeing, and improve what is known about the interconnectedness of language and spirituality.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In recent years, increased anti-immigrant hostility has trickled into school settings creating toxic climates for immigrant-origin (I-O) students (Rogers, School and society in the age of trump, 2019, UCLA's Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access). Through youth participatory action research (yPAR), this study qualitatively examined how a class of Emerging Bilingual (EB) students aimed to promote more inclusive learning environments by designing, implementing, and evaluating a school-wide program. Here, we consider how the students experienced growth in their civic development as well as how they contended with resistances encountered during the project. METHOD(S): The current study took place at a majority I-O, northeastern high school and was led by an EB class (n = 20) and its teacher. Participants were as follows: on average 16.5 years; 60\% female; and 65\% Latinx, 30\% Black, and 5\% mixed-race (Black-Latino). Multiple data sources documenting the students' experiences were collected (including weekly student reflections and ethnographic field notes) and then thematically analyzed using open coding. RESULT(S): Participating students demonstrated civic development as evidenced through: growing confidence that the program could generate positive change; enhanced sense of connection toward their classmates; and increased commitment to future civic engagement. Nonetheless, some participants demonstrated initial trepidation in both disclosing their migration stories as well as the potential efficacy of engaging in the project. Furthermore, others were disappointed by the disinterest displayed by some of their peers and teachers. CONCLUSION(S): Collaborative research can support I-O youths' civic development, though, the resistances encountered and engendered illuminate possible challenges to ensure its benefits.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 participants (10 men, 10 women, 2 transgender women) who were recruited from a Ryan White HIV/AIDS program (RWHAP) and a community-based organization. Almost all participants were foreign born. Emerging themes included language barriers, cultural differences, inadequate interpreter services, HIV-related and intersectional stigma, isolation, and relationships as a source of support. These barriers may contribute to disparities in outcomes for Latinx PLWH. New interventions are needed to overcome barriers, foster community, and ensure culturally tailored models of care.

	abstract = {Background: Widespread community engagement in advance care planning (ACP) is needed to overcome barriers to ACP implementation. Objective(s): Develop, implement, and evaluate a model for community-based ACP in rural populations with low English language fluency and health care access using lay patient navigators. Design(s): A statewide initiative to improve ACP setting/subjects-trained in a group session approach, bilingual patient navigators facilitated 1-hour English and Spanish ACP sessions discussing concerns about choosing a surrogate decision maker and completing an advance directive (AD). Participants received bilingual informational materials, including Frequently Asked Questions, an AD in English or Spanish, and Goal Setting worksheet. Measurement: Participants completed a program evaluation and 4-item ACP Engagement Survey (ACP-4) postsession. Result(s): For 18 months, 74 ACP sessions engaged 1034 participants in urban, rural, and frontier areas of the state; 39\% were ethnically diverse, 69\% female. A nurse or physician co-facilitated 49\% of sessions. Forty-seven percent of participants completed an ACP-4 with 29\% planning to name a decision maker in the next 6 months and 21\% in the next 30 days; 31\% were ready to complete an AD in the next 6 months and 22\% in the next 30 days. Evaluations showed 98\% were satisfied with sessions. Thematic analysis of interviews with facilitators highlighted barriers to delivering an ACP community-based initiative, strategies used to build community buy-in and engagement, and ways success was measured. Conclusion(s): Patient navigators effectively engaged underserved and ethnically diverse rural populations in community-based settings. This model can be adapted to improve ACP in other underserved populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Engaging diverse populations in biomedical research, including biospecimen donation, remains a national challenge. This study examined factors associated with an invitation to participate in biomedical research, intent to participate in biomedical research in the future, and participation in biomedical research and biospecimen donation among a diverse, multilingual, community-based sample across 3 distinct geographic areas. METHOD(S): Three National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers engaged in community partnerships to develop and implement population health assessments, reaching a convenience sample of 4343 participants spanning their respective catchment areas. Data harmonization, multiple imputation, and multivariable logistic modeling were used. RESULT(S): African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and other racial minority groups were more likely to be offered opportunities to participate in biomedical research compared to whites. Access to care, history of cancer, educational level, survey language, nativity, and rural residence also influenced opportunity, intent, and actual participation in biomedical research. CONCLUSION(S): Traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups reported heightened opportunity and interest in participating in biomedical research. Well-established community partnerships and long-standing community engagement around biomedical research led to a diverse sample being reached at each site and may in part explain the current study findings. However, this study illustrates an ongoing need to establish trust and diversify biomedical research participation through innovative and tailored approaches. National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers have the potential to increase opportunities for diverse participation in biomedical research through community partnerships and engagement. Additional work remains to identify and address system-level and individual-level barriers to participation in both clinical trials and biospecimen donation for research.Copyright Â© 2020 American Cancer Society.},

This review also aimed to report on the effects of these interventions on outcomes relevant to the use of anticoagulant therapy. Original articles published between 1 January 1995 and 30 June 2017 were identified using several electronic databases such as Medline, Ovid, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. The following terms were used for the three-tiered search: Tier 1, elderly, aged, older adult, geriatrics; Tier 2, health literacy, literacy, low health literacy, low English proficiency, patient literacy; and Tier 3, ethnicity, ethnic, ethnic groups, CALD, culturally and linguistically diverse, NESB, non-English speaking background, race, racial groups, religion, religious groups, and minority groups. The terms for each tier were combined with the following terms: anticoagulants, anticoagulation, warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, DOACS, new oral anticoagulants, novel oral anticoagulants, patient care, patient knowledge, comprehension, patient education, patient participation, and communication. A total of 41 studies were identified. Most of the interventions identified included older persons taking warfarin who were monitored using the international normalized ratio (INR) and who received patient education. Many interventions reported a significant positive impact on patients' knowledge, reduction in the number of adverse events caused by hemorrhage, and better INR control. More research on patient-focused interventions is needed that includes patients with limited health literacy, those from CALD backgrounds, and family members and caregivers of patients taking oral anticoagulants.Copyright Â© The Author(s), 2019.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The international liver glycogen storage disease (GSD) priority setting partnership (IGSDPSP) was established to identify the top research priorities in this area. METHOD(S): The multiphase methodology followed the principles of the James Lind Alliance (JLA) guidebook. An international scoping survey in seven languages was distributed to patients, carers and healthcare professionals to gather uncertainties, which were consolidated into summary questions. The existing literature was reviewed to ensure that the summary questions had not yet been answered. A second survey asked responders to prioritize these summary questions. A final shortlist of 22 questions was discussed during an international multi-stakeholder workshop, and a consensus was reached on the top 11 priorities using an adapted nominal group technique. RESULT(S): In the first survey, a total of 1388 questions were identified from 763 responders from 58 countries. These original uncertainties were refined into 72 summary questions for a second prioritization survey. In total 562 responders from 58 countries answered the second survey. From the second survey, the top 10 for patients, carers and healthcare professionals was identified and this shortlist of 22 questions was taken to the final workshop. During the final workshop participants identified the worldwide top 11 research priorities for liver GSD. In addition, a top 3 research priorities per liver GSD subtype was identified. CONCLUSION(S): This unique priority setting partnership is the first international, multilingual priority setting partnership focusing on ultra-rare diseases. This process provides a valuable resource for researchers and funding agencies to foster interdisciplinary and transnational research projects with a clear benefit for patients.

Understanding the independent and interactive associations of bilingualism and sex with cognition may aid in predicting cognitive aging in Hispanics/Latinos. We examined baseline (2008-2011) data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, a multicenter, prospective community-based study. Our analyses included 6,110 males and females {\textgreater}=45 years old who self-reported birth and parents' origin outside of the continental US, Spanish as their first language, and were evaluated in Spanish. Bilingualism was assessed along a Likert scale (1 = only Spanish to 4 = English{\textgreater}Spanish) for language proficiency (reading/spoken) and patterns of use (thinking/socializing). Cognitive testing included verbal learning, memory, fluency, and Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS). Linear regression models adjusted for relevant confounders, the complex survey design, and sampling weights. Participants' self-reported language proficiency was Spanish better than English, while patterns of use suggested more Spanish than English. Higher language proficiency was associated with higher performance on all cognitive indices while higher patterns of use associated with higher fluency and DSS scores (p-values {\textless} 0.01). Female sex was associated with higher performance on all cognitive indices (p-values {\textless} 0.05). There were no significant interactions with bilingualism (regardless of metric) by sex on cognition. For Hispanics/Latinos residing in the continental US and reporting birth and parents' origin elsewhere, bilingualism and female sex have independent cognitive benefits that are important to consider when evaluating cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {We conducted a qualitative study employing structured interviews with 38 community health workers, known as health promoters, from twelve rural municipalities of Chiapas, Mexico in order to characterize their work and identify aspects of their services that would be applicable to community-based tuberculosis (TB) control programs. Health promoters self-identify as being of Mayan Indian ethnicity. Most are bilingual, speaking Spanish and one of four indigenous Mayan languages native to Chiapas. They volunteer 11 h each week to conduct clinical and public health work in their communities. Over half (53\%) work with a botiquin, a medicine cabinet stocked with essential medicines. Fifty-three percent identify TB as a major problem affecting the health of their communities, with one-fifth (21\%) of promoters reporting experience caring for patients with known or suspected TB and 29\% having attended to patients with hemoptysis. One-third of health promoters have access to antibiotics (32\%) and one-half have experience with their administration; 55\% complement their biomedical treatments with traditional Mayan medicinal plant therapies in caring for their patients. We describe how health promoters employ both traditional and allopathic medicine to treat the symptoms and diseases they encounter most frequently which include fever, diarrhea, and parasitic infections. We contend that given the complex sociopolitical climate in Chiapas and the state's unwavering TB epidemic and paucity of health care infrastructure in rural areas, efforts to implement comprehensive, community-based TB control would benefit from employing the services of health promoters.

	abstract = {Brazilians are among the fastest growing segment of immigrant populations in several states of the United States. Culturally appropriate and validated health survey instruments do not exist to adequately assess the health needs of this population. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, a cross-cultural pilot project was conducted to develop and test a culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese-version of the health-promoting lifestyle profile II (HPLP-II) instrument with a convenience sample of 60 bilingual and bicultural Brazilian immigrants using a combined quasi experimental and focus group design. The project evaluated HPLP-II instrument's psychometric properties of equivalency, reliability, and score distribution in Portuguese and English. This pilot test supports equivalency, consistency, and reliability of the English and culturally-adapted Brazilian Portuguese versions of the instrument. CBPR is an effective approach in health instrument development. This instrument is an important first step in designing other appropriate instruments to explore health conditions of Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background: Hispanic children face marked disparities in childhood obesity prevalence and persistence, resulting in disproportionate morbidity and death in adulthood. Few childhood obesity interventions have been designed and tested in partnership with Hispanic families and safety-net clinics. The objective of this pragmatic pilot study was to assess preliminary effectiveness and guide design of an RCT of a novel whole-family program, HeLP (the Healthy Living Program, or La Vida Saludable). Method(s): HeLP is an intensive clinic-referred bilingual whole-family obesity prevention and treatment program delivered at recreation centers by teams of community fitness professionals and safety-net-clinicbased health educators. HeLP was designed in partnership with Hispanic families around the value Familism or Familismo. Safety-net providers trained in Motivational Interviewing refer families of children 2-16yrs with obesity (all caregivers and siblings). HeLP includes 12 x 2hr group sessions over three months, followed by structured primary care visits. Topics include parenting, child feeding, nutrition, cooking, meal planning/shopping, fitness, and mindfulness. This study compared BMI trajectories of children (with and without obesity) from 1 year preto 1 year post-intervention, in terms of \% of 95th percentile (BMI\%95). Result(s): Mean attendance was 8 of 12 sessions. 372 children had BMI measured clinically 1 year prior to HeLP, and 321(85\%) had BMI measured 1 year post-HeLP. 269 had obesity and 52 were siblings without obesity. 33\% had severe obesity, 44\% were female, and 71\% had Spanish-speaking parents. Changes in mean(SD) BMI\%95 by age group: 2-6yrs n=20 -8.0\%(10.6\%) p=0.06; 7-11yrs n=98 -5.3\%(10.8\%) p{\textless}0.001; and 12-16yrs n=95 -4.1\%(9.8\%) p{\textless}0.001. Siblings without obesity n=52 decreased -4.5\%(11.6) p{\textless}0.001. Effects were similar between families with English and Spanish speaking parents. Conclusion(s): These pilot data suggest that HeLP, a whole-family intervention by clinic-community partnership, is well accepted and can prevent and treat obesity for children 2-16 years of age from Hispanic families with low income. This pilot data supports a recently commenced comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial (R01DK130176) of the Healthy Living Program vs. best-practice primary care counseling.},

	abstract = {The wealth of free resources available to UK consumers on healthy eating and nutrition provides a very limited number which illustrate ethnic foods, including those commonly consumed in traditional African and Caribbean cuisines. This makes it difficult for health and nutrition professionals to support people from these minority ethnic groups to improve their health and diet. The aim of this project was to develop healthier versions of several traditional African Caribbean recipe resources, by working collaboratively with the Third Sector in Leeds and service-users from corresponding ethnic backgrounds. A new third-sector-academic collaborative partnership was formed in 2021 and funded by LeedsACTS! before researchers used software to theoretically analyse the nutritional composition of popular African Caribbean recipes using food composition data which was generated previously(1). Recipes were then prepared by the researchers alongside community service users (n = 10) of African Caribbean ethnicity living in Leeds in the community service setting. The feasibility and acceptability of the recipes was tested by obtaining verbal qualitative feedback from service-users following which recipes were further refined as appropriate. The study was approved by Leeds Beckett University Research Ethics Committee. A total of 12 recipes were theoretically analysed and modified to reduce the content of key nutrients of concern (i.e. energy, salt, saturated fat and free sugars) or increase those nutrients known to be at risk of lower than adequate intakes (i.e. iron, folate, fibre and calcium) within UK African Caribbean ethnic communities. Qualitative feedback from service-user cooks (1st and 2nd generation African Caribbean) found that recipes tasted and appeared acceptable (e.g. "for friends and family"; "it tastes the same as a standard recipe"), and were feasible to make. It is feasible to modify traditional recipes to be healthier and acceptable to those who are familiar with traditional African Caribbean foods. The outputs of the project, including healthier recipes, can now be shared with communities in Leeds and made available for use by UK nutrition and health practitioners. Findings warrant future research extension to include a formal evaluation of the health-related impact of the resources, in combination with new multicultural food-based guidance, on the target communities.},

	abstract = {Objective: There is an increasing demand for tertiary pain services, with long waiting times compounded by limited reach to regional and remote areas. Community-based pain programs are a feasible evidence-based model of care to improve access to multidisciplinary care. Australian primary health networks (PHNs) are well placed to commission pain programs to reduce the growing burden of chronic pain. The aim of this study was to support PHN decision-making by: (1) describing current PHN community-based pain programs; (2) assessing their alignment to key elements and implementation enablers of pain programs identified by an expert consensus process; and (3) describing PHN pain program adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): PHN program managers of community-based pain programs (n = 9) were invited to participate in an online survey and follow-up email consultation about their pain program. Six PHN program managers (representing South Eastern NSW PHN, Nepean Blue Mountains PHN, North Western Melbourne PHN, Gold Coast PHN, Adelaide PHN and the WA Primary Health Alliance) participated in the study with three PHNs commissioning two different types of pain programs. Result(s): PHN community-based pain programs are multidisciplinary programs underpinned by a biopsychosocial model of pain, and focus on self-management (e.g. exercise, psychological strategies) and pain education. Most PHN pain programs are group-based programs that target adults with chronic non-cancer pain, provide individual allied health referrals as required and are evaluated as part of the electronic Persistent Pain Outcomes Collaboration. Gaps include pain programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, with one notable exception of a PHN pain program for people from culturally and linguistically diverse and refugee backgrounds co-designed with consumers and relevant services. Programs targeting subacute pain to prevent progression to chronic pain are, with one exception, another gap area. PHN pain programs demonstrated a high level of alignment with expert-agreed key elements and implementation enablers. The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated the rapid adaptation of PHN pain programs using available methods for the delivery of digitally enabled care. Conclusion(s): The findings provide a greater understanding for researchers and PHN decision-makers of the key features of PHN community-based pain programs, their alignment with expert-agreed key elements and implementation enablers, the target-population gaps, and the types of program adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings also illustrate the potential for using digitally enabled delivery methods to increase accessibility to pain programs with further research warranted.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

While little is known about LDLs' perceptions of their own vulnerability at the workplace, less is known about the strategies they adopt to confront these risks. The purpose of this qualitative study was to assess LDLs' perceptions of their workplace dangers and to document the strategies they adopt and endorse to confront them. Guided by a participatory research approach, four focus groups stratified by age were conducted with 34 LDLs in Houston, Texas. Main focus group themes were identified using a combination of qualitative analysis methods involving a thematic analysis conducted by the interview team, LDL advisors, and bilingual Latino researchers. All participants were Latino males (mean age = 40), the majority reported having completed sixth grade or less (64.2\%) and having lived in the United States for an average of 12.7 years. We described three categories of strategies to reduce risk for workplace injury generated by local LDLs (practical knowledge and job experience, interpersonal, and personal). These strategies should be explored and encouraged to assist in planning risk-reduction programs, presented in the voice and language of Latino "inside experts" with firsthand experience. The findings of the focus group suggest that LDLs already possess a broad repertoire of strategies to cope with risks at work that can be incorporated in safety programs for LDLs and other immigrant Latino workers.},

However, health communication practices are often top down and poorly designed to rapidly meet diverse health literacy, cultural and contextual needs of the population. This paper describes a research and practice partnership focused on health literacy, multicultural health, and community engagement to address COVID-19 in Australia. The partnership became influential in the local and state-based response to the COVID-19 Delta outbreak in Western and South Western Sydney, an area of high cultural and socioeconomic diversity. Our approach, bringing together academic researchers and frontline health staff working with multicultural populations using a model of co-design and community engagement and action via the "4 M model," has been successful. It supported the Western Sydney community to achieve some of the highest vaccination rates in the world ({\textgreater}90\%). There is an ongoing need to engage respectfully and responsively with communities to address specific challenges that they face and tailor communications and supports accordingly for successful pandemic management. Combining co-designed empirical research with community engagement and action ensures needs are robustly identified and can be appropriately addressed to support an effective public health response.},

Racial/ethnic differences were especially disparate in Benton and Washington counties in northwest Arkansas, a region in the United States that experienced high COVID-19 infection rates. To address these disparities and support families with COVID-19, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Community Clinic (a federally qualified health center) worked with the Arkansas Department of Health and community partners to develop systematic Care Navigation and Enhanced Case Management. During an initial screening process, contact tracers offered Care Navigation and Enhanced Case Management services to individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 within Washington and Benton counties. Bilingual community health navigators, social workers, and nurses began providing enhanced case management to households that accepted services. Between September 9, 2020 and June 19, 2021, 3,502 households representing {\textasciitilde}13,000 individuals were offered services, and 1,511 (43.1\%) households requested/accepted services.

Using a community-based participatory research approach, we engaged community stakeholders to co-design a study to implement a culturally adapted family model DSMES (F-DSMES) intervention in faith-based organizations (FBOs) (i.e., churches). Method(s): Using a cluster-randomized controlled trial design, we will assess the effectiveness of the F-DSMES intervention for Marshallese patients with T2DM in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Twenty-four FBOs (with 12 primary participants per FBO) will be randomized to one of two study arms: the intervention arm or the wait-list control arm. Primary participants must have at least one family member willing to attend education sessions and data collection events. The F-DSMES intervention consists of ten h of diabetes education delivered by CHWs over eight to ten weeks. Data will be collected from the intervention arm at pre-intervention (baseline), immediate post-intervention (12 weeks), and three months post-intervention. The wait-list control arm will complete a second pre-intervention data collection before receiving the intervention. The primary study outcome will be glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c. Secondary measures include glucose, weight, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes self-management behaviors, and diabetes management self-efficacy. Conclusion(s): The knowledge gained from this research will inform future DSMES and other health promotion interventions conducted with Marshallese and other Pacific Islander communities.Copyright Â© 2022},

The results showed that the way of life of the villagers is consistent with natural resources and the environment as follows: 1) the community maintains knowledge and uses local wisdom to manage natural resources and the environment. 2) The relationship model of local wisdom on natural resources and environmental management of the community represents the relationship between people to society, people to the superstitions, and people to natural resources and the environment. 3) The community has the potential to manage natural resources and the environment that leading to a model community practice of sustainable development. The community has strengths in the abundance of agricultural areas, lifestyles and cultures that coexist with forests that can develop community natural trails, and be learning areas for youth that connect the relationship between local scholars and community people at all levels.

	abstract = {Community-engaged research needs involving community organisations as partners in research. Often, however, considerations regarding developing a meaningful partnership with community organisations are not highlighted. Researchers need to identify the most appropriate organisation with which to engage and their capacity to be involved. Researchers tend to involve organisations based on their connection to potential participants, which relationship often ends after achieving this objective. Further, the partner organisation may not have the capacity to contribute meaningfully to the research process. As such, it is the researchers' responsibility to build capacity within their partner organisations to encourage more sustainable and meaningful community-engaged research. Organisations pertinent to immigrant/ethnic-minority communities fall into three sectors: public, private and non-profit. While public and private sectors play an important role in addressing issues among immigrant/ethnic-minority communities, their contribution as research partners may be limited. Involving the non-profit sector, which tends to be more accessible and utilitarian and includes both grassroots associations (GAs) and immigrant service providing organisations (ISPOs), is more likely to result in mutually beneficial research partnerships and enhanced community engagement. GAs tend to be deeply rooted within, and thus are often truly representative of, the community. As they may not fully understand their importance from a researcher's perspective, nor have time for research, capacity-building activities are required to address these limitations. Additionally, ISPOs may have a different understanding of research and research priorities. Understanding the difference in perspectives and needs of these organisations, building trust and creating capacity building opportunities are important steps for researchers to consider towards building durable partnerships.Copyright Â©},

Understanding the experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse families and their children may help facilitate the development of more inclusive, appropriate, and culturally sensitive services. Semi-structured interviews with 20 Korean parents of autistic children were analyzed using a thematic approach. Barriers and facilitators at the system, provider, and family/cultural level were identified. Barriers at the system level included delays and waitlists for services, and ineffective school policies to address child behavioral challenges. At the provider level, barriers included a lack of qualified professionals, negative attitudes, and lack of guidance navigating services. For family/cultural-related barriers, language and communication difficulties, out-of-pocket costs, and stigma impeded service access. Facilitators at the system level included family-centered care and prioritization of mental health supports. At the provider level, strengths included culturally competent and bilingual professionals. The family/cultural-related facilitators identified were informal support networks, characteristics of the parent, and connections to cultural community organizations.

	abstract = {AIMS: The study aim was to examine the impact of a home-based programme intervention on organizational contexts, implementation processes and organizational capacity outcomes from multicultural, multilingual participants working at community-based organizations. DESIGN: This was a sequential exploratory, mixed-methods longitudinal study using community-based participatory research principles. SAMPLE: Twenty participants from nine multicultural, multilingual community-based organizations were in this public health initiative's intervention to develop community-designed, home-based programmes. METHOD(S): Capacity building providers delivered the intervention selected by the funders. Workshop outcomes were descriptively measured in April/May 2019. In April/May and November 2019, participants completed surveys about organizational contexts, implementation processes and organizational capacity outcomes, which were analysed with t-tests using the organization as the unit of analysis. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. RESULT(S): Seven programmes were new and two were modified. As workshop outcomes, 59\% of participants reported increased overall implementation knowledge and 74\% reported capacity building providers as the most helpful resource. After 6 to 7months, no statistically significant changes were noted in organizational contexts, implementation processes or organizational capacity outcomes. Participants benefited from capacity building because they had programmes developed, formed partnerships with capacity building providers, gained implementation knowledge, and engaged in networking. CONCLUSION(S): Participants reported excellent individual and organizational strengths. Many Initiative factors contributed to no statistical changes. Namely, there was no opportunity for baseline data; limited community-based organization engagement in the intervention model selection, timeline and processes; the Initiative's timeline did not fit participants' timeline; insufficient time to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate programmes; late literature review abstracts; lack of adequate, planful and paid capacity building time; and a contract requirement to have the programme due when it was not implementable. These Initiative design factors, as reported by participants, limited the Initiative's home-based programme development. IMPACT: This study highlights the strengths of participants, community-based organizations and capacity building providers. Model selection, timeline and budget were identified as key factors for equitable implementation in multicultural, multilingual organizations.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Asset mapping is a participatory methodology that engages community members in identifying services and settings that promote health and well-being. This study aimed to identify community assets from the perspective of Latinx immigrant families with youth with disabilities. Latinx immigrant families (n=21) participated in the mapping, followed by a reflection session and an open forum (n=30). The findings revealed that families identified faith-based organizations and social service agencies as some of the main assets in their communities, while they identified mental health services as the most needed. The results also showed that participants preferred to utilize services and resources that are within walking distance of their homes, provide safe spaces, treat them well, offer bilingual services, do not require documentation, and are affordable. This study has important implications for community scholars and practitioners interested in implementing asset-based methodologies that focus on participants as experts of their own realities and agents of change and that promote advocacy and empowerment actions.Copyright Â© 2021 Society for Community Research and Action.},

	volume = {25},
	doi = {10.1111/hex.13556},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reflections on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic often evoke the concept of 'resilience' to describe the way health systems adjusted and adapted their functions to withstand the disturbance of a crisis, and in some cases, improve and transform in its wake. Drawing from this, this study focuses on the role of consumer representatives in healthcare services in initiating changes to the way they participated in the pandemic response in the state of New South Wales in Australia. METHOD(S): In-depth interviews were conducted with two cohorts of consumer representatives. Cohort A included experienced and self-identified consumer leaders, who worked together in a COVID-19 Consumer Leaders Taskforce; Cohort B included participants outside of this group, and purposively included consumer representatives from rural and regional areas, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. RESULT(S): The pause in consumer engagement to support health service decision-making in responding to the pandemic forced consumer representatives to consider alternative approaches to participate. Some initiated networking with each other, forming new collaborations to produce consumer-led research and guidelines on pandemic-related patient care. Others mobilized support from community and politicians to lobby for specific healthcare issues in their local areas. CONCLUSION(S): The response to the COVID-19 pandemic made visible the brittle nature of previous engagement processes of involving consumers in organizational design and governance. However, the momentum for proactive self-organization in an unexpected crisis created space for consumer representatives to reset and reimagine their role as active partners in health services. Their ability to adapt and adjust ways of working are key assets for a resilient health system. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This project is a collaborative study between academic researchers and health consumer (patient and public) representatives. It followed the principles of codesign and coresearch, whereby both consumer representatives and academic researchers contributed equally to all stages of the project. The study was cofunded by both academic institutions and consumer representative organizations.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Health Expectations published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Worse, the challenge of inadequate representation among racial and ethnic minorities also persists, deepening disparities in health. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is a participatory communication method that centers on effective dialogue between researchers and community stakeholders with the goal of creating an equitable partnership for health and social change. The objective of the current study was to provide an update since a systematic review in 2012, on the current status of the empirical research, with a particular focus on the elements of CBPR methods used to improve the rate of accrual of members of racial and ethnic minority communities for clinical trials. Our systematic review found a large increase in the number of CBPR related studies and studies related to racial and ethnic representation in research. More than 85\% of studies employing CBPR methods saw statistically positive outcomes. Specifically, the elements of CBPR that are associated with these positive outcomes include community partner participation in (1) a study advisory committee, (2) data collection, (3) the development of interventions, and (4) participant recruitment. However, the results of our study indicate that researchers need to be more transparent about the extent of community participation as well as more thoroughly and accurately describe the nature of the partnership with members of minority communities in order to build upon the scientific literature on community-engaged methods.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The insights of Latinx/@ immigrants are essential to developing interventions that better address complex multilevel phenomena impacting mental health. Despite important advances in methods that genuinely embody participatory research practices, attention to collaborative data collection, analysis, and dissemination are limited. Our aim is to describe the development and implementation of research practices to address these gaps through an emphasis on and understanding of the centrality of language in collaborative research processes. METHOD(S): Guided from the outset by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic research partnership recognized the importance of developing and intentionally studying our collaborative processes. As part of an ethnographic interview study with 24 Latinx/@ immigrants, a community-university research team developed innovative methods, including practices related to research team meetings, data collection, analysis, and dissemination, which we documented through ongoing discussion and reflection. RESULT(S): The resulting participatory research processes were grounded in a theoretical framework of praxis and language and included six innovative and iterative stages: (a) Establishing the research team, (b) planning the interview process/data collection, (c) developing the data analysis methodology, (d) interpreting findings to adapt the intervention, (e) integrating results of the participatory process into the analysis, and (f) data analysis for dissemination. CONCLUSION(S): A focus on praxis and language revealed how the language of research structures' power, meaning, feeling, collaboration, analysis, and transformation. We also found that bilingual participatory analytic processes have important implications with respect to achieving genuine inclusion in rigorous research that moves toward equity for Latinx/@ immigrants and other populations.

Through youth participatory action research (yPAR), this study qualitatively examined how a class of Emerging Bilingual (EB) students aimed to promote more inclusive learning environments by designing, implementing, and evaluating a school-wide program. Here, we consider how the students experienced growth in their civic development as well as how they contended with resistances encountered during the project. Method(s): The current study took place at amajority I-O, northeastern high school and was led by an EB class (n = 20) and its teacher. Participants were as follows: on average 16.5 years; 60\% female; and 65\% Latinx, 30\%Black, and 5\% mixed-race (Black-Latino).Multiple data sources documenting the students' experiences were collected (including weekly student reflections and ethnographic field notes) and then thematically analyzed using open coding. Result(s): Participating students demonstrated civic development as evidenced through: growing confidence that the program could generate positive change; enhanced sense of connection toward their classmates; and increased commitment to future civic engagement. Nonetheless, some participants demonstrated initial trepidation in both disclosing their migration stories as well as the potential efficacy of engaging in the project. Furthermore, otherswere disappointed by the disinterest displayed by some of their peers and teachers. Conclusion(s): Collaborative research can support I-O youths' civic development, though, the resistances encountered and engendered illuminate possible challenges to ensure its benefits.Copyright Â© 2021.

As the Johns Hopkins Health System faced a surge in admissions of limited English proficiency patients with COVID-19, it became evident that an institutional strategy to address the needs of this patient population was needed. The Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) Latinx Anchor Strategy was established in April 2020 with diverse stakeholder engagement to identify the most urgent community needs and develop timely solutions. The JHM Latinx Anchor Strategy provided a platform for information sharing to promote equitable access to resources for Latinxs with limited English proficiency who were impacted by COVID-19. Leveraging institutional, community, and government resources and expertise, the JHM Latinx Anchor Strategy helped establish interventions to improve access to COVID-19 testing and care for low-income immigrants without a primary care doctor and helped mitigate economic vulnerability through the distribution of food for 2,677 individuals and cash to 446 families and 95 individuals (May to August 2020). Expanded linguistic and culturally competent communication through webinars and livestream events reached more than 10,000 community members and partners. Over 7,500 limited English proficiency patients received linguistically congruent direct patient services through the Esperanza Center bilingual hotline, community testing resulting efforts, and inpatient consultations. The first stage of the JHM Latinx Anchor Strategy relied heavily on volunteer efforts. Funding for a sustainable response will be required to address ongoing COVID-19 needs, including expansion of the bilingual/bicultural healthcare workforce, expanded access to primary care, and investments in population health strategies addressing social determinants of health.},

	abstract = {Obesity and being overweight are major public health concerns that health coaching can assist people to manage through encouraging self-management and behaviour change. The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service (GHS) is a telephone health coaching service in Australia that has effectively improved the health of the general population but has had less participation of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations. The Chinese population is the largest migrant group in Australia with increased risk of diabetes but had reduced access to the GHS program due to communication barriers. The GHS developed a pilot program for Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese-speaking) communities using bilingual coaches and translated material to address these barriers. Qualitative research was undertaken with Chinese stakeholders (14 interviews) and 11 program participants from the group which had completed the program (2 focus groups in Mandarin and Cantonese) to understand their experiences and the success of promotional activities. This research does not contain the experiences of the people that withdrew from the program. The bilingual program was culturally and linguistically appropriate and addressed risk factors for chronic conditions. Participants formed positive relationships with bilingual coaches who they preferred to interpreters. They felt the program promoted healthy eating, weight and physical activity. Although Chinese stakeholders had concerns about participants' ability to goal set, participants said they met their health goals and were committed to the GHS program. Strategies to enhance the program included promoting the bilingual GHS to the communities and stakeholders. Factors to consider beyond language in adapting the program to the Australian Chinese communities include meeting the heterogenous needs of the older population, ensuring community engagement and addressing cultural beliefs and practices.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Limited health literacy is associated with decreased preventive health services and is reported among immigrant groups in the USA, but the health literacy of African immigrants is not known. OBJECTIVE(S): Assess health literacy, its association with engagement in primary care and select sociodemographic variables, and the use of two health literacy measures with African immigrants. METHOD(S): We conducted a community-based participatory research cross-sectional survey among African immigrants in Massachusetts. Participants completed the Newest Vital Sign, the Health Literacy Skills Instrument, acceptability questionnaires, and a Health Survey. We observed and recorded comments and questions as participants completed the surveys. KEY RESULTS: Out of 75 participants, 60\% have limited health literacy. Over 80\% are connected to a health care system and comfortable speaking with their doctor/nurse. Education, English proficiency, country of origin, and access to health care are associated with health literacy. Participants found the measures easy to understand but difficult to answer. Observation data revealed unfamiliarity with nutrition labels, cooking measurements, and navigation of internet links, and the need for clarification of select items. CONCLUSION(S): Most African immigrants in this study have limited health literacy despite English proficiency, college education, employment, and connection to a health system. Further research is needed to determine the value of aligning the measurement of health literacy with the cultural-linguistic identities of the population being assessed versus the need to understand their health literacy within the dominant culture.Copyright Â© 2021.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Community-based Bilingual Doulas (CBDs) are women from migrant communities trained to support and comfort migrant women during labour and birth, and to facilitate linguistic and cultural communication between women, their partners and staff. The aim of the study was to describe CBDs' experiences of supporting migrant women during labour and birth, working alongside caregivers, and to explore CBDs perceptions of their work situation in a Swedish setting. METHOD(S): As part of an ongoing randomised trial of CBD support in XX, Sweden, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with nine of the 35 participating CBDs. The interviews were conducted in each CBD's first language (Arabic, Somali, Tigrinya, Russian, Polish) or in Swedish, and were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Thematic analysis of data identified, analysed, interpreted and reported patterns and themes across the data. RESULT(S): The overarching theme which emerged was "Multi-tasking bilingual doulas bridging gaps - despite standing on fragile ground". To reach out a helping hand and receive appreciation from the women when their needs were met, motivated the CBDs to continue despite the constraints related to roles, working conditions and boundaries. The CBDs felt proud of being acknowledged, although they did also feel a need for more supervision and education. CONCLUSION(S): The CBDs experienced their doula tasks as meaningful and emotionally rewarding, which mostly outweighed the challenges of their work which they saw as insecure, exhausting and underpaid. If CBDs are implemented on a larger scale, the scope of their role (including boundaries), education, access to supervision and working conditions all need to be better addressed.Copyright Â© 2021.

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION: We implemented a novel, community-based mobile health unit program by repurposing transportation vans with COVID-19 testing equipment, preventive hygiene kits, and mRNA vaccines. Our goal was to expand testing and vaccine availability in highly affected communities in the Greater Boston area. We used a "double equity" model by hiring workers from a local transportation company whose staff were at risk of unemployment. The vans were staffed with racially/ ethnically diverse and multilingual staff, including members of the target communities themselves. We incorporated a system of "trusted messengers" to answer questions about COVID-19 and in particular, vaccination from the community. We implemented this program with crucial input from community-based organizations and municipal public health departments. Van location sites were guided by community partners, in some cases incorporating SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance data to meet rapidly changing community needs. MEASURES OF SUCCESS: Our goals were to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of a COVID-19 testing program guided by community partnerships and SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance data; (2) improve access to COVID-19 testing in underserved communities; and (3) improve access to COVID-19 vaccination among racial/ethnic minorities. We collected ongoing feedback (e.g. through the local community advisory groups etc) on the mobile health program from community partners, patients, and staff. We compared sociodemographic characteristics of mobile health participants with the general population of the state of Massachusetts and the population of the target communities. FINDINGS TO DATE: From January 2021 - January 2022, our mobile health units have tested greater than 4500 persons in predominantly low socioeconomic communities that have been highly impacted by the pandemic. From May 2021 - January 2022, we vaccinated 5480 persons in these communities. An analysis of our program from January 2021 - January 2022 demonstrated that mobile health unit participants receiving COVID-19 vaccines were significantly more likely to be non-White and Hispanic compared with the general vaccinated population of the state of Massachusetts and of the target communities, and these findings were statistically significant. We also found that the mobile health units vaccinated more youth and adolescents in the target community compared with the general state vaccination data. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION: Delivery of preventive COVID19 care via mobile health units is feasible and associated with high usage from affected communities when implemented with high stakeholder engagement and expertise from local public health departments. Employing diverse, multilingual, and well-trained healthcare staff as trusted messengers likely improved COVID-19 vaccine uptake in this population.},

	abstract = {Background: Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is integral in NCI-designated Cancer Centers. COEs work with community stakeholders identifying community needs, communicating research, and catalyzing significant activities to Cancer Center's catchment areas. To facilitate this, the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) Office of COE established the Research Outreach for Southern Arizona (ROSA) program, supporting bidirectional partnerships between basic scientists and underrepresented communities in catchment areas. Objective(s): To describe a community and student ambassador program developed as ROSA, bridging gaps between basic science programs and community needs in UACC catchment areas. Method(s): The UACC catchment areas include five southern Arizona counties where 40\% of residents are Hispanic, compared to 18.3\% in the US. Moreover, ambassadors were bilingual/bicultural Hispanic undergraduate students (n=4) and Hispanic community members (n=4). The ambassador program held weekly cancer educational discussions, research methods, monthly Meet the Scientist events, and presentations on experiences. Evaluations for ROSA were completed by all affiliates. Result(s): Overall, ROSA ambassadors reported increased knowledge of research and increased confidence sharing cancer information. Facilitators of ROSA community members included a bilingual/bicultural team, outreach collaborations, and participant compensation. Barriers included payments for undocumented members, lack of Spanish-speaking scientists, and reduced in-person activities. As a result of ROSA partnerships, scientists, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders is developing Scientific Cafes where scientists present research proposals for community feedback. The workgroup will select a community-driven project to implement in the future. Discussion(s): Based on positive ambassador evaluations and working group collaborations, ROSA is successful in growing authentic partnerships between scientists and communities. Recently, a community-based survey was developed by members to examine perceptions of cancer and willingness of clinical research participation. This survey will inform how basic scientists align research within community needs. ROSA will continue to be valuable in providing bidirectional engagement from basic scientists and community members in cancer research.},

	abstract = {Methods: PAR generally entails a 4-phase process: Planning, Action, Reflection, and Evaluation. A collaborative, ground-up approach was used in which bilingual, bicultural, native Spanishlanguage stakeholder translators and researchers co-created a translation planning framework that involved capacity building (e.g., on-going mindfulness immersion and practice by the translators), meeting weekly to share ideas, updates, insights, and concerns and creating a space to reflect on the multicultural lineage of this project (Pali/Sanskrit, English, Spanish) and linguistic and cultural considerations to keep in mind when adapting Wakeful for a Spanish-language audience. Result(s): A 4-phase PAR translation methodology entailed both translators exchanging the roles of primary translator and reviewer, which ensured that both translators had equal input on the translation of the entire script, without each having to translate the full script separately. In line with PAR, the translators were encouraged to trust their respective linguistic and cultural intuitions as a primary source for translating the script from English to Spanish and to conduct independent confirmatory research whenever necessary to check their choices and decisions if there was any doubt. Background(s): Participatory-action research (PAR) is an antioppressive, equity-empowering approach in which researchers and community stakeholders engage in an iterative, collaborative process together to enact social justice and change through shared research. To our knowledge, this approach has never been implemented as a part of linguistic translation, let alone translation of a mind-body intervention where socio-cultural factors may play a large role in understanding and uptake. The purpose of this abstract is to present themethodology of translating an English-languagemindfulness application (Wakeful) into Spanish using PAR principles. Conclusion(s): The Spanish version of Wakeful is inclusive and accessible, providing Spanish-speaking communities with a linguistically sound and culturally informed tool. The PAR translation methodology is innovative and applicable for any integrative medicine tool or program that needs to be translated.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Advances in technology and internet capability have provided an opportunity for efficient collection of Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) during medical treatment. Here we describe the development and implementation of a system for monitoring patient reported adverse events (AEs) and quality of life (QoL) using electronic PRO (ePRO) instruments for patients enrolled on the Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis (I-SPY 2 TRIAL), a phase II adaptive platform clinical trial for locally advanced breast cancer. Method(s): We designed an ePRO system to increase the accuracy of patient-reported QoL and AE data collection with the intent to act on symptoms in real time. Using the OpenClinica electronic data capture system, we developed rules-based logic to build automated ePRO surveys, customized to the I-SPY 2 treatment schedule. Weekly surveys contained a maximum of 126 validated, branching logic questions from the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Health Measures and the National Cancer Institute's Patient Reported Outcomes-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAETM) Sinstruments. We piloted ePROs at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to evaluate compatibility with a variety of I-SPY 2 patient scenarios (e.g., dose delays). We then staggered rollout of the ePRO system to 22 I-SPY 2 sites to ensure technological feasibility. In order to improve accuracy of data collection, we utilized real-time tracking and developed a Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) training manual, which integrated workflow diagrams with technical solutions. CRCs were trained using remote video sessions. Result(s): The UCSF ePRO pilot began in September of 2020. Over 9-months, we accrued 43 I-SPY 2 patients (average age of 43.8 years), whose interactions with the ePRO system informed design improvements. Of the patients who received a baseline ePRO survey, the completion rate was 75.9\% (average age of 44.2 years). This represents an increase from the 15-20\% baseline completion rate for the 360 UCSF I-SPY 2 patients who received paper-based PRO surveys between May 2012-January 2019. As of June 2021, the ePRO system was operational at all 22 I-SPY 2 sites. The UCSF pilot revealed that engagement with patients at critical timepoints improved survey completion. CRCs facilitated patient participation by sending instructional emails and communicating with patients weekly. We tracked data completeness using a Patient Tracking report, which displayed each patient's survey completion history. This real-time tool enabled CRCs to identify patients who had not completed ePRO surveys prior to their visit, so they could be provided a tablet computer to complete the survey in the clinic. After introducing tablets into the workflow at UCSF, patient completion of the baseline survey increased from 75.9\% to 80\%. Conclusion(s): The transition from paper to electronic QOL and AE data collection improves the ability of patients to complete PRO surveys, but the process must also be optimized and integrated into clinical workflow and trial conduct. In the future, we will present additional results highlighting the feasibility of multilingual ePRO integration into I-SPY 2. ePRO also provides a new opportunity for data analysis, as well as the potential to reduce high grade toxicity through early intervention. It will allow us to assess QoL and AE data by drug regimen, site, provider, and study treatment. The creation of clinician-facing reports also enables access to patient responses in real-time. By implementing ePRO within I-SPY 2, we not only increase efficiency and accuracy of patient-reported data collection, but also improve quality of care and patient safety.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION Under-representation in health-related research is one of a multitude of factors that contribute to cancer disparities experienced by African American and Latinx communities. Barriers to research participation stem from historical social injustices, are multi-faceted and include factors specific to the research process, research team members and community experiences and expectations about research participation. Informed consent is a longitudinal process and represents an opportunity to address these barriers and potentially improve access to research by individuals from underrepresented groups. The purpose of the Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) study was to develop and test an integrated, literacy- and culturally-sensitive, multi-component intervention that addresses barriers to research participation during the informed consent process. METHODS A multi-pronged community engaged approach was used to inform the development the three components of the STRIDE intervention. At each of the three study sites, Community Investigators, local community members of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, contribute to intervention development, pilot testing and dissemination activities. Community engagement studios provided a semi-structured opportunity to solicit feedback from community experts in a facilitated group regarding the relevance, usability and understandability of the STRIDE intervention components. Additionally, component-specific approaches to obtaining community input were utilized. RESULTS The three components were developed and refined with community input. The STRIDE intervention includes: (1) an electronic consent (eConsent) framework within the REDCap software platform that incorporates tools designed to facilitate material comprehension and relevance, (2) a storytelling intervention in which prior research participants from diverse backgrounds share their experiences, and (3) a simulation-based training program for research assistants that emphasizes cultural competency and communication skills for assisting in the informed consent process. CONCLUSIONS The STRIDE project had produced an integrated set of interventions that are available to support researchers across the CTSA hubs and beyond in efforts to enhance diversity in clinical research. Early dissemination of STRIDE intervention components include utilization in national COVID-19 trials and research networks.},

	abstract = {Background: There is an increasing body of literature that suggests a relationship between modifiable dietary behaviors and alcohol use and liver cancer. We designed and implemented a culturally tailored community-based education program to promote liver cancer prevention. Method(s): Through NCI funded U54 TUFCCC/HC Cancer Partnership Community Outreach Core program, using CBPR approach, we engaged community-based organizations and community stakeholders serving underserved African, Asian, and Hispanic American communities in the Philadelphia metropolitan area and New York City. The community-based education incorporated in-person and virtual hybrid education workshops to address COVID-19 pandemic barriers. We conducted pre-education surveys and follow-up assessments at 6 months post-education. Participants' dietary behaviors, alcohol use, and sociodemographic characteristics were examined at both time points. Result(s): 526 participants were recruited including 92 African Americans, 247 Asian Americans, and 187 Hispanic Americans, with an average age of 59. We found that at 6- month follow-up assessment, participants had average decreased intake of red meat (3.148/6 vs. 2.685/6, p {\textless} 0.001), and average increased intake of vegetables (4.484/6 vs. 5.044/6, p {\textless} 0.001) and fruits (4.327/6 vs. 4.877/6, p {\textless} 0.001), compared to their intake at pre-education assessment. Additionally, average change in beer (-0.252) and spirit (-0.905) consumption substantively decreased from pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up assessment. Conclusion(s): This community-based education showed significant effects in improving healthy dietary behaviors and reducing alcohol intake among community members through CBPR community engagement from the two metropolitan areas.

	abstract = {Study Purpose: Immigrants and foreign-born individuals, many with low English proficiency and low socio-economic status, make up a high proportion of the population in New York City (NYC). Immigrant populations have distinct demographic, immigration, social and biological histories, and environmental exposures that differentially impact their cancer risk profiles. However, while data on cancer incidence and mortality are widely available in this group, data on cancer-related social and behavioral priorities and resources among immigrant, low-income, low-English proficient communities is sparse. Method(s): Our research focus is to engage community stakeholders to identify multilevel determinants surrounding cancer prevention and disparities and assess resources available to adults within NYU Langone's Perlmutter Cancer Center (PCC) catchment area with a focus on racial/ethnic minority and immigrant populations through a health resources and needs assessment survey. With this research focus, we harmonized measures across questionnaires from other NCI-designated Community and Engagement Core (COE) Centers. Further, health priorities and questions in the survey were informed by listening sessions with diverse community partners and feedback from NYU PCC clinicians and basic scientists. We are translating the survey questionnaire into 8 languages commonly used in the geographical area of focus to prioritize data collection among immigrants in NYC: namely, Arabic, Bangla, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Spanish, Russian, Urdu. Data collection will be conducted through Open REDCap and paper surveys (n=1200). We are simultaneously developing a multilingual REDCap survey tool to be administered in the identified languages. Result(s): Participant recruitment strategies are tailored to survey hard-to-reach, low-English proficient communities through in-person recruitment, social media outreach, and engaging existing community-and faith-based organization partners. To facilitate wider reach, community health workers (CHWs) with strong community connections, language fluency, deep cultural knowledge, and training in working with immigrant communities have been recruited for data collection. Survey modules will explore common measures asked by NCI-designated Centers on sociodemographic information and knowledge, attitude, and behaviors and also include assessment on contemporary topics related to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer screening and care, including telehealth services. Recruitment and data collection phases are ongoing. Conclusion(s): This survey will determine community-driven cancer-related priorities and available resources among under-resourced immigrant communities and will contribute to strategic planning and resource allocation for the PCC to meet the needs of this population.},

	abstract = {Objectives To evaluate impacts of a residency-based waiting period for health insurance coverage on lived experiences of health and settlement for im/migrant women in British Columbia, Canada. Design The IRIS study is a mixed-methods, community-based, qualitative evaluation of recently arrived im/migrant women's access to sexual and reproductive care. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted by trained multilingual and multicultural interviewers with lived migration experience in the participant's preferred language. Setting Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from July 2018 to January 2020. Participants Data collected from community focus groups (four groups, n=29) of both service providers and im/migrant women was used. Following this, qualitative interviews with service providers (n=10) and im/migrant women (n=47) were conducted. Eligible participants self-identified as women; were aged 18-49 and had arrived in Canada from another country. Eligible providers were employed in the health, social or legal sectors working with im/migrant women. Results The wait period resulted in mistrust and internalised stigma for racialised im/migrant women, for whom the policy resulted in feeling 'undeserving' of care. Resulting administrative burden produced delays and unmet need for care, particularly related to sexual and reproductive healthcare and children's health. Unexpected costs meant difficult choices between survival and care. Negative health outcomes included the inability to family plan, difficulties during pregnancy, as well as hardships related not being able to seek help for sick children. Community-based organisations provided support in many areas but could not fill all gaps produced by this policy. Conclusions Findings highlight severe, yet commonly overlooked, health inequities produced by a mandatory health coverage wait period within a purportedly 'universal' healthcare system. Health system policies such as mandatory 'waiting periods' produce discriminatory and inequitable outcomes for im/migrant women. Policy reforms towards full 'healthcare for all' are urgently needed to affirm the health and human rights of all im/migrants.Copyright Â© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.},

	abstract = {Purpose African American English (AAE) speakers often face mismatches between home language and school language, coupled with negative attitudes toward AAE in the classroom. This forum, Serving African American English Speakers in Schools Through Interprofessional Education \& Practice, will help researchers, parents, and school-based practitioners communicate in ways that are synergistic, collaborative, and transparent to improve educational outcomes of AAE speakers. Method The forum includes a tutorial offering readers instructions on how to engage in community-based participatory research (Holt, 2021). Through two clinical focus articles, readers will recognize how AAE develops during the preschool years and is expressed across various linguistic contexts and elicitation tasks (Newkirk-Turner \& Green, 2021) and identify markers of developmental language disorder within AAE from language samples analyzed in Computerized Language Analysis (Overton et al., 2021). Seven empirical articles employ such designs as quantitative (Byrd \& Brown, 2021; Diehm \& Hendricks, 2021; Hendricks \& Jimenez, 2021; Maher et al., 2021; Mahurin-Smith et al., 2021), qualitative (Hamilton \& DeThorne, 2021), and mixed methods (Mills et al., 2021). These articles will help readers identify ways in which AAE affects how teachers view its speakers' language skills and communicative practices and relates to its speakers' literacy outcomes. Conclusion The goal of the forum is to make a lasting contribution to the discipline with a concentrated focus on how to assess and address communicative variation in the U.S. classroom.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify areas where transition from hospital to community could be improved, with a special focus on racial, ethnic, and language differences. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey administered by postal mail and bilingual telephone interviewers. METHOD(S): Patients were randomly selected within strata by race, ethnicity, and language proficiency. A total of 224 patients (response rate: 63.5\%) who had recently experienced a hospital stay completed the survey. RESULT(S): Overall, 1 in 4 patients were alone at discharge. More than half of patients with limited English proficiency reported lack of access to medical interpreters and translated materials. We noted significant differences by race, ethnicity, and language in technology access and in patient-reported worries in the posthospital period. Hispanic or Latino patients and patients with limited English proficiency were less likely to report access to a computer and less likely to access the Patient Gateway portal. Black or African American patients were also less likely to use the Patient Gateway portal. Asian patients were more likely to be worried about getting home health services. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings highlight the enhanced difficulties that diverse patients may experience when transitioning from hospital to community-based settings. When considering how to best address the complex needs of diverse populations, interventions must be sensitive to the presence or absence of others, potential digital divides, and medical interpretation.Copyright Â© 2021 Ascend Media.

Design(s): Prospective, community-based cohort study: The Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC)-Cognitive study. Setting(s): Nueces County, Texas. Participant(s): Community-dwelling Mexican Americans age 65+, recruited door-to-door using a two-stage area probability sampling procedure. Measurements: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); self-reported bilingualism scale. Participants were classified as monolingual, Spanish dominant bilingual, English dominant bilingual, or balanced bilingual based upon bilingualism scale responses. Linear regressions examined relationships among bilingualism, demographics, cognitive assessment language, and MoCA scores. Result(s): The analytic sample included 547 Mexican American participants (60\% female). Fifty-eight percent were classified as balanced bilingual, the majority (88.6\%) of whom selected assessment in English. Balanced bilinguals that completed the MoCA in English performed better than balanced bilinguals that completed the MoCA in Spanish (b = -4.0, p {\textless} 0.05). Among balanced bilinguals that took the MoCA in Spanish, education outside of the United States was associated with better performance (b = 4.4, p {\textless} 0.001). Adjusting for demographics and education, we found no association between the degree of bilingualism and MoCA performance (p's {\textgreater} 0.10). Conclusion(s): Bilingualism is important to consider in cognitive aging studies in linguistically diverse communities. Future research should examine whether cognitive test language selection affects cognitive measurement precision in balanced bilinguals.Copyright Â© 2021 The American Geriatrics Society.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess community practices related to COVID-19 prevention and its associated factors during the early introduction of the disease to the study area. Setting and participants A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study. Outcome measure A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. Results From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53\%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2\%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3\%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0\%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8\%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9\%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures. Conclusion COVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this project was to document a partnership working process from a cross-sectoral and cross-cultural participatory health research study focused on promoting physical activity among women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Design(s): A participatory health research paradigm was used to support this pilot feasibility study into partnership working for health promotion. Action research and community development principles underpinned the design, delivery and interpretation of findings from a community-based survey, data from four focus groups and bespoke interventions. Setting(s): Community groups from education, leisure, health and religious community sectors, and charity sectors, in the City of Liverpool, met in different venues representing those sectors. Method(s): Reflection on the process of community engagement in a research study guided by socio-ecological model, community development and action research principles. Result(s): Seven emerging collaborative processes based on effective partnership working, capacity-building practice and sustaining health and wellbeing evolved from a partnership between a Community Researchers Advisory Group and a Partners Advisory Group. BAME 'community connectors' were key to obtaining feedback from 213 women from 16 ethnic groups, which influenced the development of bespoke interventions and local sport and physical activity long-term policy, as one means of reducing social inequalities for women from BAME backgrounds. Conclusion(s): This feasibility study demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of partnership working as a public health tool. The local Sport and Physical Activity Alliance and council department worked together to promote the sustainability of BAME-focused programmes as part of their governance and policy frameworks.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Objective: We describe the development, translation and validation of epilepsy-screening questionnaires in the three most popular Nigerian languages: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. Method(s): A 9-item epilepsy-screening questionnaire was developed by modifying previously validated English language questionnaires. Separate multilingual experts forward- and back-translated them to the three target languages. Translations were discussed with fieldworkers and community members for ethnolinguistic acceptability and comprehension. We used an unmatched affected-case versus unaffected-control design for the pilot study. Cases were people with epilepsy attending the tertiary hospitals where these languages are spoken. The controls were relatives of cases or people attending for other medical conditions. An affirmative response to any of the nine questions amounted to a positive screen for epilepsy. Result(s): We recruited 153 (75 cases and 78 controls) people for the Hausa version, 106 (45 cases and 61 controls) for Igbo and 153 (66 cases and 87 controls) for the Yoruba. The sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire were: Hausa (97.3\% and 88.5\%), Igbo (91.1\% and 88.5\%) and Yoruba (93.9\% and 86.7\%). The three versions reliably indicated epilepsy with positive predictive values of 85.9\% (Hausa), 85.4\% (Igbo) and 87.3\% (Yoruba) and reliably excluded epilepsy with negative predictive values of 97.1\% (Hausa), 93.1\% (Igbo) and 95.1\% (Yoruba). Positive likelihood ratios were all greater than one. Conclusion(s): Validated epilepsy screening questionnaires are now available for the three languages to be used for community-based epilepsy survey in Nigeria. The translation and validation process are discussed to facilitate usage and development for other languages in sub-Saharan Africa.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Objective To explore community pharmacists' experiences serving culturally and linguistically diverse patients who have low English proficiency. Setting Community pharmacists in Australia. Method Focus group discussions with practising community pharmacists were conducted. Participants were recruited from metropolitan Sydney. Discussion centred around their current experiences and practice changes needed to enhance the provision of culturally competent pharmaceutical care. Thematic analysis using the constant comparison method within a grounded theory approach was performed on the data collected. Main outcome measure Participants' experiences in providing culturally competent care to culturally and linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency. Results Thirty community pharmacists participated in six focus group discussions. Inadequate provision of culturally competent care was found to be primarily due to the issue of language incongruence between pharmacist and patient. Participants proposed various means with which such care may be provided to ensure patient safety. Conclusion Pharmacist participants expressed being inadequately equipped to provide culturally competent care in the community setting and identified potential means by which such care may be delivered. Addressing identified barriers that hinder community pharmacists' capacity to engage in culturally competent practice can potentially improve provision of pharmaceutical care to culturally and linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Effective involvement is exceptionally difficult when patients are migrants with limited command of specialized language. Interactional practices that promote effective distribution of knowledge and access to it are needed: by doctors interacting directly with patients in a shared language and by mediators providing interpreting services across different languages. In this paper, we look at two types of sequence which seem to be effective in involving (migrant) patients. The first concerns clinicians' reactions to spontaneous patients' initiatives, like claims to knowledge or personal narratives. The second concerns interpreters' explanations when they render the clinicians' instructions to the patients. While both sequences are clearly designed to promote patients' participation, they need particular communicative competence on the part of staff, clinicians, and interpreters.},

Literature review of the barriers to mammography screening formed the basis to allow us to draft a narrative presentation for each targeted cultural group: African American, African-born, Chinese, Latina, and Muslim women, as well as LGBTQ individuals. The presentations were then tested with focus groups comprised of gatekeepers and members from local community and faith-based organizations which served the targeted populations. Feedback from focus groups and gatekeepers was incorporated into the presentations, and if necessary, the presentations were translated. Subsequently, the presentations were re-tested for appropriateness and reviewed for consistency in message, design, educational information, and slide sequencing.

The project included a community and clinic component and served a primarily Latino population. In collaboration with a federally qualified health center (FQHC) and three community-based organizations, bilingual/bicultural CHWs recruited men and women (not up-to-date with the cancer screening guidelines) from a FQHC and the community. Participants received education plus navigation and no-cost cancer screening tests. Together with the FQHC, we outlined eligibility criteria, project protocols, project implementation, and evaluation activities. With the community organizations, we outlined recruitment protocols-when to recruit, how to recruit, and connections with other organizations. CHWs enrolled 3045 men and women into the education-plus-navigation intervention. Overall, 71\% received at least one cancer screening. Stratifying by gender, 72\% of women received at least one cancer screening test whereas 63\% of enrolled men received a test for colorectal cancer. Knowledge of screening guidelines and the belief in early detection also increased from baseline to follow-up. Our evidence-based education-plus-navigation intervention successfully reached large numbers of underserved men and women and yielded positive changes in cancer screening and knowledge of screening guidelines and the belief in early detection.

	abstract = {Mental health services are increasingly encouraged to use co-design methodologies to engage individuals and families affected by mental health problems in service design and improvement. This scoping review aimed to identify research that used co-design methods with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities in mental health services, and to identify methodological considerations for working with this population. In October 2019, we searched five electronic databases (CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science) to identify papers published in which people from CALD backgrounds were engaged in the co-design of a mental health service or program. Searches were limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English in the last 25 years (1993-2019). The search identified nine articles that matched the inclusion criteria. Using a scoping review methodology, the first author charted the data using extraction fields and then used qualitative synthesis methods to identify themes. Data were grouped into themes relevant to the research question. The two key themes relate first, to improving the experience for CALD communities when engaging in co-design research and second, to the development of co-design methods themselves. These findings support the need for further research into the transferability of co-design tools with CALD communities, particularly if co-design is to become a best practice method for service design and improvement. This scoping review identified methodological and practical consideration for researchers looking to use co-design with CALD communities for mental health service design, re-design or quality improvement initiatives. Further research is required to explore experiences of co-design methods, including documented protocols such as experience-based co-design, with CALD communities. This review indicates that explanatory models of mental health, community and co-design impact partnerships with CALD communities, and need to be understood to optimise the quality of these relationships when using co-design methods.Copyright Â© 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1002/hpja.407},
	abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Drowning is a global public health challenge with a need to ensure equity to drowning prevention information and interventions. In Australia, people born overseas are identified as being at greater risk of drowning. This paper presents findings from a community-based qualitative evaluation of swimming and water safety (SWS) programs delivered to adults from migrant backgrounds in Sydney, Australia. METHOD(S): A qualitative study was conducted in November-December 2019 among 35 female participants of SWS programs targeted to adult migrants. While offered to all SWS program participants, no males took part in the study. Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using a deductive approach. The domains of enquiry were guided by the health belief model and the theory of planned behaviour. RESULT(S): Study participants were {\textgreater}=25 years, first generation and most had lived in Australia for {\textgreater}=10 years. Most were nonswimmers and were fearful of water prior to the program. Key themes were: direct SWS program outcomes, health and well-being; enablers and barriers to participation including: motivation, a program coordinator, fear and settlement priorities. CONCLUSION(S): Findings suggest that in order to increase SWS participation among migrant communities, the broader determinants of health need to be considered. Culturally appropriate strategies are required to enable both men and women equal opportunities to access SWS programs. SO WHAT: SWS programs provide multiple benefits for adult migrants; however, the impact on reducing inequities is limited, with broader multi-strategic health promotion approaches and policies required for inclusion and sustainability.Copyright Â© 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.},

	volume = {32},
	doi = {10.1002/hpja.439},
	abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Indigenous women continue to experience reproductive health inequities. While enhancing health literacy is suggested as an approach for reducing disparities and increasing equity, there is a paucity of literature exploring Indigenous women's conceptualisation of reproductive health literacy. This paper demonstrates one approach to developing a reproductive health literacy framework for Yolnu (Indigenous) women in a remote Northern Australian setting. METHOD(S): Using a decolonising participatory action research approach, a senior Yolnu researcher led interviews, group story sharing sessions, historic site visits and on-country cultural demonstration sessions with participants on reproductive health topics. Data were collected in the participants' first language(s) and occasionally in English. Data were digitally recorded on camera, Dictaphone, video and in handwritten notes. The senior Yolnu researcher worked with a Yolnu interpreter to translate the data into English. Data underwent a progressive verbal relational content analysis to map and build a framework. RESULT(S): A reproductive health literacy framework that privileges Yolnu reproductive knowledge, practices and language was successfully co-designed. The framework was embedded in the metaphor of Pandanus mat and uses key cultural domains of Yolnu identity as a connecting foundation to women's reproductive knowledges and ceremonial milestones. CONCLUSION(S): The framework offers a culturally responsive and multilingual approach to sensitively discuss and operationalise reproductive health literacy. The framework empowers Yolnu cultural identities; accounts for both Yolnu and Western medical knowledges; and honours participants' requests for "Two-Way" learning. SO WHAT?: This research demonstrates an innovative approach to co-designing a culturally responsive framework for reproductive health literacy in a complex and multilingual context. Such approaches offer a promising way forward for empowering Indigenous women to define reproductive health literacy and contribute to improving their reproductive health outcomes.Copyright Â© 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the population of older adults in the US steadily increases and becomes more diverse, there is an urgent need to integrate geriatric competencies into baccalaureate nursing education. PURPOSE: To integrate the Institute for Healthcare Improvement 4 Ms Framework into an existing baccalaureate nursing community clinical experience to build geriatric and interprofessional competencies and promote positive health outcomes. METHOD(S): As part of the Geriatric Workforce Enhancement Program, 15 students worked with bilingual social workers and community health workers in an affordable housing urban highrise, assessed building residents and implemented personalized plans of care using the 4Ms framework (what matters to the individual, medications, mentation, and mobility). RESULT(S): Students demonstrated competence conducting cognition and depression screening, medication review, and functional and fall risk assessments. Student self-rated achievement of learning objectives ranged from 4.3 to 4.8 (1-5 scale). A retrospective pretest-posttest survey suggested learning about the importance of interprofessional teamwork, and integration of person-centered values when providing care to older adults in the community. Students reflected on barriers to health for older adults in low socioeconomic states and the importance of improving care across the continuum. CONCLUSION(S): The 4Ms framework provided a valuable construct to guide the community experience and teach geriatric evidence-based practice to nursing students.Copyright Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

	abstract = {Background \& problem: Birthing On Country (BOC) is an international movement for returning childbirth to First Nations peoples and their communities. The RISE Framework was developed to guide evidence-based BOC implementation but has not yet been tested in a remote Australian community setting. Aim(s): To test the transferability and acceptability of the RISE Framework in a remote multilingual setting in a Yolnu (First Nations) community in Northern Australia. Method(s): Working in partnership with one remote Yolnu community, we used a decolonising participatory action research (D-PAR) approach to begin co-designing services and test the acceptability of the RISE Framework. A three-phased transferability process was developed: Warming the ground; Co-Interpreting; and Acceptability Testing. Finding(s): The RISE Framework was customized to the local Yolnu context and called 'Caring for Mum on Country'. It was articulated in two languages: Djambarrpuynu and English. We successfully used it to guide discussions at a community gathering privileging the voices of senior women to inform the design of local maternity services. Discussion(s): Using the D-PAR approach, the RISE Framework was readily adapatable to this complex, remote and multilingual setting. It resonated with the Yolnu community and proved useful for identifying current limitations of existing maternity services and importantly facilitating the design of Yolnu centred strength-based maternity services. Conclusion(s): The RISE Framework, combined with our transformative methodology, offers a promising approach to guiding complex interventions for returning services to First Nations communities in diverse contexts. Testing in other settings will further contribute to growing an evidence-base for BOC service planning and implementation.Copyright Â© 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: A paucity of literature describes the growing Chinese American community's end-of-life (EOL) priorities and preferences. OBJECTIVE(S): Develop a culturally-tailored advance care planning (ACP) tool to understand the EOL preferences of this underserved minority group. METHOD(S): Informed by the Cultural Appropriateness Theory, the Chinese American Coalition for Compassionate Care (CACCC) developed Heart to Heart (HTH) Cards using a 3-step approach. First, CACCC created and refined a list of bilingual, culturally relevant EOL issues. Next, CACCC organized the EOL issues into a card deck. Finally, CACCC developed a unique playstyle of the cards-the HTH Cafe. From 2014-2019, CACCC recruited Chinese American volunteers and participants for HTH Cafes. Following each Cafe, participants completed an anonymous survey describing their sociodemographics, top 3 cards, and cafe evaluation. RESULT(S): The 54 HTH Cards were organized into 4 suits (spiritual, physical, financial/legal, and social). Each card displayed a culturally-tailored EOL issue in English and Chinese. Playstyles included one-on-one and group formats (ie. HTH Cafe). CACCC volunteers conducted 316 HTH Cafes for 2,267 Chinese American adults. Most participants were female (61.6\%), between 18-50 years old (56.7\%), lived in California (80.2\%) and born in Asia (74.3\%). The top priority (25.5\%) was "If I'm going to die anyway, I don't want to be kept alive by machines." Participants thought the session was pleasant (99.5\%) and expressed intent to complete advance directives (86.5\%). CONCLUSION(S): HTH Cards represents the first, theory-driven, culturally-tailored ACP tool for Chinese Americans. More research is needed to establish its impact on ACP conversations and outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personal care product use may contribute to elevated body burdens of consumer product chemicals among women of color; however, racial/ethnic differences in product use has been understudied. Community-engaged research can support the recruitment of diverse participants. OBJECTIVE(S): To document personal care product use among a diverse group of women (aged 18-34 years) living in California. METHOD(S): Through a community-academic partnership, we surveyed 357 women in California about product use information for 54 cosmetic, hair, menstrual/intimate care, and leave-on and rinse-off personal care products. We compared type and frequency of product use among Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian, and White women. We also summarized use of scented products and reasons women select products. RESULT(S): Women reported using a median of 8 products daily, with some women reporting up to 30 products daily. Hispanic/Latinx and Asian women used more cosmetics, and Black women used more hair and menstrual/intimate products than other women. Of the 54 products compared, there were significant differences in use by race/ethnicity for 28 products, with the largest number of significant differences between Black and White women. SIGNIFICANCE: There is growing information on chemical exposures from personal care products and consequent adverse health effects, with implications for health disparities. Yet, there remains limited information on the range and types of products used by diverse racial/ethnic communities. This study helps close an important gap on product use inventories that can enable more informed public health interventions to limit exposures from personal care products.},

We aim to describe: 1) patient-reported communication-related characteristics for 16 disaggregated Asian American subgroups; and 2) the association of patient comprehension of provider communication with socio-demographics, language proficiency and concordance, and perceived cultural sensitivity in this population. Method(s): Descriptive statistics are presented for 1269 Asian American immigrants responding to cross-sectional, venue-sampled surveys conducted in New York City. Logistic regression models examine predictors of low comprehension of provider communication. Result(s): Approximately 11\% of respondents reported low comprehension of provider communication: lowest among South Asians and highest among Southeast Asians. Eighty-four percent were language-concordant with their provider, 90.1\% agreed that their provider understood their background and values, and 16.5\% felt their provider looked down on them. Low comprehension of provider communication was significantly associated with Southeast Asian subgroup, less education, limited English proficiency, public health insurance, patient-provider language discordance, and perceived low cultural understanding. Conclusion(s): Among our sample, language and cultural sensitivity are associated with comprehension of provider communication. Practice implications: Strategies improving language access and cultural sensitivity may be important for Asian immigrant patients. These could include interpretation services, bilingual community-based providers, and cultural sensitivity training.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Cancer remains the number one cause of death among the Latino population despite the decrease in cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. Latino patients experience worse quality of life, more advanced stages of disease, and longer times to definitive diagnosis and treatment initiation. Yet there are few interventions that leverage clinical and community-based approaches to address these disparities. The aim of this formative qualitative study was to explore the specific care needs and barriers encountered by Latino patients to refine a community-based intervention delivered by community health workers (CHWs). Method(s): We conducted semi-structured, indepth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with low-income, Latino adults with a past or current history of cancer and/or their caregivers in a county comprised of 80\% Latino populations in California. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, audio-recorded, transcribed and translated. Analysis was based in grounded theory and performed using the constant comparative method. Result(s): Fourteen interviews were conducted with a total of 18 participants; 9 involved the patient, 4 involved the patient and a designated caregiver, and 1 involved a caregiver only. Four major themes emerged that included: 1) lack of overall understanding of all aspects of cancer including their cancer diagnosis, significance of advance directives, precision medicine, and cancer care plans; 2) severe challenges in communicating cancer care needs and receiving support services due to language barriers; 3) stress and anxiety regarding financial hardships related to job loss and insurance barriers; 4) the need for supportive, bilingual and bicultural personnel to assist in overcoming these challenges. Conclusion(s): Latino patients with cancer and caregivers described major barriers they encounter after a cancer diagnosis. Participants described important approaches to address these cancer specific needs and reduce cancer disparities among these populations.},

	abstract = {TOPIC: Education, Research, and Quality Improvement TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: To describe the development, implementation, and learner engagement in a longitudinal international remote critical care continuing medical education program in China. METHOD(S): Based on the Mayo Clinic Checklist for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute and Illness and iNjury (CERTAIN) program, we designed and delivered a longitudinal 40-week remote coaching program for a community-based teaching hospital in Shandong Province, China. Based on a mixed-methods needs assessment that included learner feedback using an exploratory sequential design and ICU process and outcomes data, we developed a curriculum that included asynchronous, online learning modules with multiple language captions and weekly remote education sessions using a blend of didactic presentations on common critical care syndromes, virtual simulation, journal club, and case-based discussions. Faculty included a diverse group of critical care experts and bilingual facilitators. The program also included clinical research and quality improvement workshops to facilitate implementation of key concepts identified during these activities. Participants completed a survey using a 5 point anchored Likert scale after each educational activity to provide feedback and guide course improvement. RESULT(S): Twenty-two Chinese clinicians (18 physicians, 4 nurses) enrolled in this CERTAIN longitudinal program. Learners completed a total of 163 hours (mean 7.4 hr/learner) asynchronous online learning, and to date have completed 23 weekly education sessions (total 28 hours, including an extended virtual simulation experience). Survey response rate was 56\%. Learners reported a high rate of overall satisfaction with the course (112, 61\% Excellent; 55 (30\%) Very Good) and specific topic discussions (110,60\% Excellent; 57, 31\% Very Good), with steady improvement over time. Perceived practice relevance was also high (110, 59\% Excellent; 55,30\% Very Good), and this effort has informed ongoing local performance improvement initiatives. CONCLUSION(S): Remote delivery of longitudinal critical care continuing education program in China using asynchronous learning, case-based discussion, and virtual simulation is feasible, associated with a high rate of learner satisfaction, and increases engagement in quality improvement initiatives. This innovative global education initiative offers an important potential solution to strengthen critical care services in remote, resource-limited settings at low cost, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The World Health Organization has identified remote education programs as a priority to strengthen international critical care services and better meet growing global clinical demand. The best method to effectively deliver continuing medical education to international healthcare providers with unique cultural, organizational, and practice backgrounds is not well defined.

	abstract = {Diabetes impacts rural populations at higher rates compared to their urban counterparts. Diabetes selfmanagement education and support (DSMES) is an evidence-based standard of care for people with diabetes. Yet, in rural areas, DSMES is often not available, culturally relevant, or integrated into primary care practices where many people receive diabetes care. This study uses a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to adapt the language, tools, and delivery of a DSMES program for use in Spanish and Englishspeaking populations in the High Plains Research Network in rural eastern Colorado. Boot Camp Translation (BCT) is a CBPR method that combines medical, research, and local community member expertise to create locally relevant language, messages and materials to promote discussion and action around a medical condition. For this study, community partners included 13 diverse community members (including bilingual Spanish-speakers, patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers). The group identified a particular need to increase awareness of the connection between diabetes and mental health, specifically depression, and diabetes burnout. Language and tools to address stigma and normalize the connection, talking points to initiate discussions with care teams, and calls for practices to increase screening for depression among patients with diabetes, are under development. Additional themes identified include incorporating nutrition information for food that is culturally appropriate and locally available, and integrating DSMES within the primary care practices where people with diabetes receive their care. Community engagement is crucial to support DSMES program adoption in rural communities.},

Appraise the community-based advance care planning interventions aimed at increasing engagement in racial/ethnic minorities. Background and Objectives: Racial/ethnic minority older adults in the United States (US) often experience access, language, and cultural barriers to advance care planning. Our aim was to summarize and appraise the current science on interventions aimed at increasing advance care planning in racial/ethnic minority, community-dwelling older adults. Study Identification: We systematically searched PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases until April 2020. We included articles representing interventional, community-based, primary research in the US for racial/ethnic minority older adults in the US. We excluded studies that targeted caregiver, family, or surrogates due to wide variation in demographics. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Following PRISMA guidelines, two researchers independently screened articles identified in the systematic search, reviewed eligible articles, and abstracted data using a standardized data extraction form. Two reviewers appraised the quality of the included articles using the Downs and Black checklist and a third reviewer settled discrepancies. Result(s): 1823 abstracts and titles were reviewed, five met the inclusion criteria, which represented four unique interventions. Interventions were conducted in Asian American (n=2) and Hispanic (n=2) communities. Interventions included educational nurse-led workshops (n=2) and one-on-one social worker-led sessions (n=2). Quality appraisal identified methodological weaknesses including convenience samples and self-reported outcomes. Outcomes measured were intention to complete or completion of advance directive or advance care planning discussion, an improvement in advance directive knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward and comfort with end-of-life care planning. The interventions increased intention to or completion of an advance directive and improved advance care planning knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. However, Results were inconclusive regarding promoting advance care planning discussions with family and health care providers. Conclusions and Implications: Existing literature on interventions to increase advance care planning in US racial/ethnic minority older adults is limited and specific to certain populations. Although the Results from these studies were promising, high-quality interventions that reflect the diverse needs and barriers to advance care planning are needed.Copyright Â© 2021},

A qualitative study of among Navajo cancer survivors, in which focus groups and individual interviews included questions related to perceptions of cancer causes, prevention, and treatment, allowed us to evaluate several aspects of the cancer experience from the Navajo perspective. An experienced, bilingual facilitator led the discussions using a standardized guide. Discussions were audio-recorded, documented by field notes, translated, as needed, and transcribed. NVivo software was used to summarize major themes according to the PEN-3 and health belief models. Navajo cancer survivors (N=32) were both males (n=13) and females (n=19) that had been previously diagnosed with a variety of cancers: colorectal, breast, ovarian, cervical, esophageal, gall bladder, stomach, prostate, kidney, and hematologic. Many survivors had accurate knowledge of risk factors for cancer. Barriers to screening and clinical care included language, expense, geography, fear, lack of information, skepticism related to Western medicine, and treatment side effects. While some survivors experienced familial support, others were isolated from the family and community due to the perspective of cancer as a contagion. However, resilience, hope, trust in select community organizations, a desire to restore balance, and to support younger generations were positive attributes expressed regarding the treatment and recovery process. These evaluations need to be replicated across a larger cross-section of the Native cancer survivor community.},

Objective(s): Explore the minority hospice utilization gap from the hospice perspective by examining perceived barriers and facilitators as well as practices and policies. Method(s): Qualitative surveys were conducted with 41 hospices across the United States. Qualitative data analysis included performing a limited content analysis, including the identification of themes and representative quotations. Result(s): Commonly reported barriers to hospice care for racial/ethnic minorities included culture/beliefs, mistrust of the medical system, and language barriers. A major theme pertaining to successful minority hospice enrollment was an inclusive culture that provided language services, staff cultural training, and a diverse staff. Another major theme was the importance of community outreach activities that extended beyond the medical community and forming relationships with churches, racial/ethnic minority community leaders, and Native American reservations. Conclusion(s): The importance of incorporating a culture of inclusivity by forming committees, providing language services, and offering culturally competent care emerged in this qualitative study. Building strong external relationships with community groups such as churches is a strategy used to increase racial/ethnic minority utilization of hospice.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {This paper explores a partnership between an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and a community to understand trauma given the high rates of reported violence among youth locally. The accumulative stress of living in high-stress, high-poverty environments coupled with the normative developmental tasks of adolescence is thought to place these youths at risk for negative mental and physical outcomes (Murry et al., 2011). The current research uses a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and developmental lens to better understand environmental stressors and subsequent trauma among Black youth. Specifically, the paper describes the recruitment, engagement, and equitable partnership between a youth advisory board (YAB), university research team, and community agencies advisory board (CAB). The current work is part of a larger research study designed to explore environmental stressors, coping, and social supports for Black youth residing in low-resource urban communities. The broad objective of the research is to develop a trauma-informed community intervention to improve adolescent mental health. The initial phase of this university-community research, which entails the YAB, CAB, and university discussion groups, is outlined in this paper. Community engagement and trust are key factors described in the literature when collaborating with communities of color. These themes were reiterated by research partners in this study. The research team created coding terms to identify themes from YAB and CAB transcript data, respectively. YAB themes regarding stressors centered around financial strain, anger, and loss/violence. CAB themes regarding adolescent mental health and resources centered around trauma, trust, and sustainability. Initial steps to utilize the themes identified thus far are described. The unique advantages of an HBCU and CBPR to address mental health disparities in ethnic minority communities are also highlighted.Copyright Â© 2020 Society for Community Research and Action.},

Qualitative data for this mental health needs assessment come from 61 individuals who represent local residents and/or consumers of mental health services, Executive Directors, providers of mental health and non-mental health community based services. We identified systems-related and psychosocial barriers to seeking mental health services: difficulty navigating the mental health system, language barriers, dearth of culturally competent providers; and mental health stigma and mental health literacy and non-Western notions of mental health. Collaborative efforts across stakeholders are called for to address the mental health needs of racial and ethnic minorities in a local community.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the perceptions of and barriers to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation among Asian and Pacific Islander (API) immigrants. DESIGN: Qualitative focus groups were conducted in 4 API communities. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from 4 API communities (n = 68; 22 Tongan, 18 Vietnamese, 16 Filipino, and 12 Chinese) through local community-based organizations in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. METHOD(S): Trained bilingual and bicultural researchers conducted 8 focus groups in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Prior to the start of each focus group, participants completed a demographic questionnaire which included a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Security Module. ANALYSIS: Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and those in the native languages were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts in native languages were reviewed and translated into English. All transcripts were organized in ATLAS ti version 8.0 and analyzed using thematic analysis. The USDA Food Security Module results were scored and assessed for food insecurity. RESULT(S): Median age of participants was 58 years and 59.4\% (n = 38) were food insecure. Barriers to SNAP participation were identified and organized within the Social Ecological Model by the following themes: (1) unclear program information, (2) application process, (3) shame, and (4) pride. Despite commonalities found across API subgroups, unique challenges with public charge and immigration existed within the subgroups. CONCLUSION(S): Culturally relevant in-language SNAP materials and multilevel interventions are needed to mitigate barriers and increase SNAP participation rates among low-income API groups.},

	abstract = {The value of community assessments depends on the researchers' ability to reach a diverse and representative sample of participants. This process is particularly challenging when assessing the health and well-being of vulnerable populations that are reticent to participate in research because of demographic and sociopolitical factors. One such group is Latinxs (the gender-neutral version of Latinos or Latinas) of mixed immigration status who live in low-income, socially and geographically isolated enclaves in the Southeast. Framed by community-based participatory research and social marketing theories, this study describes practical strategies for health researchers, practitioners, and advocates seeking to engage and build trusting relationship within U.S. Latinx communities. First, identify and leverage points of entry to different segments of the communities of interest by engaging meaningful gatekeepers from different sections of the population and searching for places where potential participants gather. Second, reduce the burden of assessments by using incentives and creating intentional reciprocity. Third, establish critical, long-lasting trust with community members, leaders, and allies by adapting data collection procedures, ensuring confidentiality, engaging bilingual facilitators, and most important, being present with and for the community. Finally, presenting the findings back to the community can increase the ownership of the process.},

	abstract = {Background: Latinos are underrepresented in biomedical research, particularly biomarker research, yet they constitute the nation's largest ethnic/racial minority. Optimal methods for obtaining biospecimens for biomarker research among Latinos need to be identified. To minimize barriers and enhance participation, this study developed and tested tailored strategies for collecting biomarkers of chronic stress and premature aging among Spanish-speaking Latina breast cancer survivors. Method(s): This study used a community-based participatory approach and selected hair and saliva as noninvasive biospecimens to assess telomere length, the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and hair cortisol concentration. We developed bilingual multimedia instructional materials, and community health workers assisted in collections. Telephone surveys assessed willingness to participate in future studies, barriers to sample collection, and recommendations for improving the strategies. Result(s): A total of 103 participants were recruited over 18 months from two rural sites in California, and 88 were retained at 6-month follow-up. At baseline, rates of donating salivary DNA for telomere length measurement, saliva for CAR analysis, and hair for cortisol concentration were 98\%, 89\%, and 52\%, respectively. At follow-up, rates were 83\%, 76\%, and 55\%, respectively. The majority of participants reported being very willing to provide hair (72\%) or saliva (74\%) for future studies. Conclusion(s): Our results support the feasibility of including minorities in biomedical research. We report excellent rates of saliva collection when community partners are engaged in the process, and when patient-centered and culturally tailored recruitment methods are implemented. Impact: The development of methods to facilitate the inclusion of minorities in biomedical research is critical to eliminate racial/ ethnic health disparities.Copyright Â© 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Although many diabetes self-management apps exist, these are not tailored for people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. This study aimed to explore GP perceptions of how diabetes app features could help GPs better support their patients from CALD backgrounds. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews with GPs in Western Sydney explored attitudes towards a proposed app's suitability for CALD patients. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using Framework Analysis. Theme 1 explored the implications of perceptions that patients' health literacy is dependent on the language used. Theme 2 explored the influence of messaging from sources that share the patient's language and culture (including misinformation from community sources). Theme 3 described the suitability of the app platform for CALD patients, and its potential challenges in this group. GPs perceived that a diabetes app could be useful for providing support to patients from CALD backgrounds. Findings suggest app features should be optimised to address existing challenges that GPs face and carefully consider strategies for recruiting CALD patients. It is important that GPs feel comfortable promoting an app to their CALD patients to help increase participation rates by people in the CALD community.Copyright Â© 2020 La Trobe University.},

	abstract = {Among Latinas, breast cancer is the primary cause of cancer- associated mortality. Latinas experience breast cancerhealth disparities in disease-free survival, health-related quality of life, pain, fatigue, and anxiety, which may be aresult of experiences of chronic stress. Chronic stress can impact the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis,leading to changes in the tumor microenvironment and subsequently facilitate cancer progression. Little is knownabout the role of stress in cancer health disparities among Latinas. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of biospecimen collection and describe biologic and self-reported levels of stress using baseline data from arandomized controlled trial of a stress-management intervention among Spanish-speaking rural Latina breast cancersurvivors (LBCS). We used community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to recruit women, conductinterviews, and obtain saliva and hair samples. Recruiters were bilingual-bicultural women from local communitiesworking in the community organizations that were research partners. Videos and print materials with graphics weredeveloped in low-literacy Spanish to demonstrate biospecimen collection procedures. Recruiters providedinstruction and demonstrations on sample collection and collected self-reported stress and depressive symptoms viain-person interviews in Spanish. Self-reported measures of stress and depressive symptoms consisted of thePerceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Biologic stress was measured usinghair (1 sample) and salivary cortisol (3 samples/day for 3 days). Mean hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in pc/mg units was used to assess chronic stress. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) measure assessed the activity of the HPA axis; curves that demonstrate a cortisol peak 30 minutes after awakening and a cortisol dip bedtime wereconsidered normal. We recruited 103 participants from the Central Valley and Imperial County, California. Eighty-sixpercent provided saliva samples for CAR analysis, and 53\% provided hair samples for HCC. Participants' mean agewas 56 years (SD=10.6) and mean time since breast cancer diagnosis was 3.2 years (SD=3.2). Participantsreported moderate (PSS mean score = 14.5; SD 7.5) stress levels and mild depression (PHQ-8 mean score = 6.3;SD 5.5). Biologic stress measurements demonstrated that 37\% of participants had an abnormal CAR at baseline,and elevated HCC (mean HCC = 362.9 pg/mg). Bivariate models showed no relationship between self-reported and biologic markers of stress. Using CBPR methods leads to successful recruitment of Latinas to clinical researchinvolving biospecimen collection. Although self-reported stress and depression were moderate or mild, biologicstress levels were high and abnormal in over 1/3 of participants, suggesting that chronic stress, and its subsequentintegration into the biologic stress pathways, may help explain ethnic disparities in cancer outcomes of LBCS.},

	volume = {28},
	doi = {10.1016/j.joca.2020.02.268},
	abstract = {Purpose: Clinical guidelines support exercise in managing osteoarthritis. Up to 90\% of people with OA do not meet the minimal levels of activity despite strong evidence that being active is effective for managing OA symptoms. Subsets of the population such as immigrants are known to be at higher risks for inactivity and sedentary behavior. With 7.5 million immigrants, Canada currently has the second highest percentage (21.9\%) of foreign-born nationals in the world. Physical activity in immigrants is influenced by migration-related factors such as acculturation, stressors with settling in a new country, physical environments, and availability of resources. Interpersonal barriers including competing time demands, cultural norms and behaviours, motivation and lack of peer support have also been identified as important determinants of physical activity. Adult physical inactivity rates are high in Muslim majority countries, especially for Arab Muslims and Muslim women, irrespective of ethnicity. Physical activity varies across genders with women, and in particular visible minority women, reporting less physical activity than their male counterparts. Barriers to Muslim women participating in leisure physical activity, for example, include gendered norms of behavior, religious interpretations of women's participation in sports, lack of access to gender-segregated spaces, lack of social support, lack of education on physical activity and competing social obligations. Many Muslim majority countries are experiencing rapid development with changes in population dietary patterns, urbanization, increased obesity and lower physical activity rates; all of which influences the health norms and behaviors of immigrants settling in Canada. Method(s): Using a community-based participatory approach with Muslim communities, we explored the experiences of and barriers to physical activity from the perspective of South Asian, Arab, and African Muslim immigrant communities in an urban setting: Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Purposeful sampling and theoretical sampling were used to recruit participants. Data saturation occurred when no new themes emerged from the data and identified themes included rich descriptive repetitive data from participants. Older participants chose to participate in either individual interview or focus groups based on personal preferences while all stakeholders were interviewed individually. To further explore the preliminary themes on physical activity identified in the data, two additional focus group discussions with a sample of nine older adults were completed to explore facilitators and barriers to physical activity. All interviews were completed by the first author who was experienced in immigrant health research and identified as being from the Muslim community. Community interpreters (bilingual social workers or community volunteers) were used for interviews and focus groups when older adults were not comfortable conversing in the English language. A thematic analysis was undertaken with an iterative process of multiple re-readings of the data with validation of identified preliminary codes and themes through further data collection via interviews and focus group discussions. In following an intersectional approach, we also searched for variations in experiences across gender, migration status, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and age categories. Result(s): Of the 68 participants who took part in the study, 52 were older adults and 16 were stakeholders including service providers, community volunteers, caregivers, and faith and community leaders. Participants varied in terms of language fluency, levels of education, length of time in Canada and immigration status with almost equal numbers of long-term economic immigrants who had come to Canada as young adults and newcomer immigrants who came to Canada post-retirement. Participating community groups emphasized the importance of physical activity in older age and prioritized the need for physical activity programs. The four themes highlight Muslim older immigrants' perspectives on physical activity in Canada: (a) values and approaches to staying active, (b) health factors: pain and health limitations, (c) social factors: culture, religion and belonging; and (d) environmental factors: safety and accessibility. Lack of effective strategies for pain management was a major concern for many participants and hindered their ability to engage in both daily living activities and more strenuous forms of exercise and recreation activities. Conclusion(s): Physical activity in older age is valued by older Muslim immigrants but financial, cultural, and environmental barriers to physical activity warrant intervention. One avenue of promoting physical activity in Muslim older immigrants is the development of local, accessible, and culturally sensitive programming that address both the physical activity, education, and socialization needs of this population.Copyright Â© 2020},

	volume = {66},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.11.049},
	abstract = {Purpose: Adolescence is a time of rapid brain development and concurrent novelty seeking. In some youth this results in health-impacting "high risk" behaviors. The labeling of youth and the moral and social values that are placed on their behaviors has been described previously. Less is understood about how labeling of youth in populations with relatively high rates of adolescent-specific health challenges such as teen pregnancy and youth violence influences their health, wellbeing, and engagement with potentially protective community resources. This study extends Labeling Theory to investigate how community and peer labeling of adolescents, based on their known or perceived behaviors, affects their relationships with peers, engagement in school, and support from adults in the primarily Latinx agricultural community of Salinas, CA. Method(s): Forty eighth graders (age range 12 to 15) were recruited from four Salinas middle schools to participate in two semi-structured in-depth interviews approximately one year apart. Bilingual research assistants conducted interviews in English or Spanish. Participants were a subset of the youth enrolled in A Crecer, the Salinas Teen Health Study, a prospective cohort study with two years of follow-up. Interviews focused on adolescents' future aspirations, support systems, and relationships. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and five research team members completed iterative rounds of modified grounded theory coding. Result(s): Participants identified behaviors as being on a "good path" (e.g., success in school, abstinence from sex and illicit substances) or a "wrong path" (e.g., truancy, sexual activity, substance use). They noted that youth may be labeled as "good kids" or "bad kids" based on their observed behaviors. Participants also reported that youth may be labeled based on other people's perceptions of their behaviors, where youth live, or their family and peer associations. Participants often expressed harsh judgements about the actions of youth who engage in behaviors on the "wrong path." However, consistent with Labeling Theory's concept of proximity, when considering the actions of close friends and family members, participants held a nuanced understanding that "good kids" might sometimes make high-risk choices. Participants reflected on the negative effects of being labeled as a "bad kid" with particular emphasis on disengagement from adult supports, ostracism from peer connections, and limitations on educational opportunities. Conclusion(s): Early and middle adolescents in this agricultural community reported that youth who are labeled as "bad kids" due to perceived or actual engagement in high-risk behaviors have less social support from peers, adult community members, and school. These labels may be influenced by community norms, as well as by structural factors affecting students struggling in the educational system or those involved in the juvenile justice system. Interventions to shift perceptions of age-normative risk- taking towards a research and community focus on why some youth take risks, the environmental circumstances that promote risk-taking, and the structural factors that can protect youth may reduce youth stigma and improve their engagement in critical community support systems.

	abstract = {Introduction Migrant women consistently rate their care during labour and birth more negatively than non-migrant women, due to communication difficulties, lack of familiarity with how care is provided, and discrimination and prejudicial staff attitudes. They also report being left alone, feeling fearful, unsafe and unsupported, and have poorer birth outcomes than non-migrant women. Community-based doulas (CBDs) are bilingual women from migrant communities who are trained in childbirth and labour support, and who facilitate communication between woman-partner-staff during childbirth. This study protocol describes the design, rationale and methods of a randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CBD support for improving the intrapartum care experiences and postnatal well-being of migrant women giving birth in Sweden. Methods and analysis A randomised controlled trial. From six antenatal care clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, we aim to recruit 200 pregnant Somali, Arabic, Polish, Russian and Tigrinya-speaking women who cannot communicate fluently in Swedish, are 18 years or older and with no contraindications for vaginal birth. In addition to standard labour support, women are randomised to CBD support (n=100) or no such support during labour (n=100). Trained CBDs meet with women once or twice before the birth, provide emotional, physical and communication support to women throughout labour and birth in hospital, and then meet with women once or twice after the birth. Women's ratings of the intrapartum care experiences and postnatal well-being are assessed at 6-8 weeks after the birth using selected questions from the Migrant Friendly Maternity Care Questionnaire and by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. The intervention group will be compared with the control group using intention-to-treat analyses. ORs and 95\% CIs will be estimated and adjustments made if key participant characteristics differ between trial arms.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically review physical activity interventions among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations and explore the strategies used to recruit CALD populations, the cultural adaptations made in these interventions, and the cultural adaptations used among successful interventions. DESIGN: Four electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL) was searched in March 2017 and re-run in January 2018. Manual screening of the reference lists of the included studies was also conducted. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review were: intervention studies (e.g. controlled and non-controlled studies), physical activity as primary outcome and as the only health behaviour targeted, culturally and linguistically diverse population of interest, published in English, and targeted adult populations (i.e. aged {\textgreater}=18). RESULT(S): A total of 19 articles were included in this review, comprising 15 unique studies. Most studies targeted Latino populations, published in the United States, and targeted women. An array of recruitment strategies were used, such as recruiting from religious establishments or religious and cultural events, and community organisations and events. The majority of studies made cultural adaptations to their intervention to suit the CALD population of interest, however, the level of detail of reported adjustments was limited. Successful interventions were those that generally included community consultation to inform their intervention, language adjustments, community health workers/bilingual/bicultural personnel for intervention delivery, recruitment, and data-collection, and using culturally-relevant intervention material. CONCLUSION(S): Although many studies included in this review reported increases in physical activity at follow-up, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to the lower level of methodological quality and reporting on study methodology. Future interventions designed for CALD populations should be of greater methodological quality and also provide a greater level of transparency in terms of the cultural adaptations that have been made to the intervention.},

DESIGN: Qualitative data collected via in-depth, semistructured interviews in Spanish or English. SETTING: Community-based program offering supported urban home gardening together with nutrition education in Santa Clara County, CA. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 purposively sampled low-income participants in an urban home gardening program. Participants were primarily female (n=24) and Latino/a (n=22). PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: Perceptions of the nutrition and health benefits of education-enhanced urban home gardening. ANALYSIS: Bilingual researchers coded transcripts using a hybrid inductive and deductive approach. Two coders double coded at intervals, independently reviewed coding reports, organized content into key themes, and selected exemplary quotations. RESULT(S): The most salient perceived impacts were greater food access, increased consumption of fresh produce, a shift toward home cooking, and decreased fast food consumption. Participants attributed these changes to greater affordability, freshness, flavor, and convenience of their garden produce; increased health motivation owing to pride in their gardens; and improved nutritional knowledge. Participants also reported improved physical activity, mental health, and stress management; some reported improved weight and adherence to diabetes-healthy diets.

The Interactive Map of Chinatown Traffic Pollution was the centerpiece of a communication approach designed to make complex scientific information about traffic-related air pollution comprehensible to Chinese immigrants with limited English proficiency. The map enabled visualization of the spatial distribution of ultrafine particles (less than 100 nanometers in diameter), a toxic and invisible form of air pollution, in Boston Chinatown. A university-community partnership enabled design of intergenerational training sessions aimed toward empowering community members to take health-promoting actions that reduce exposure to ultrafine particulate pollution. A mixed methods approach was taken to evaluation. Nine high school youth learned to use the map and then tutored adults recruited from English as a Second Language (ESL) classes and from a community workshop. Seventy-three of these adults completed a pre-post survey measuring change in three domains: pollution knowledge, attitudes toward environmental issues, and self-efficacy in using maps. Adult participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all three domains (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, all p {\textless} 0.01). Seventeen adults and nine youth participated in interviews. Interview participants reported adjusting daily routines to reduce exposure to pollution.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cancer cause of death among US Hispanics. CRC screening among the Hispanic population is lower compared with non-Hispanic Whites. METHOD(S): The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory study was to better understand the barriers and facilitators of CRC screening and preference for stool-based testing collection methods among the predominantly Hispanic population of El Paso, Texas. Nine focus groups were conducted by a trained bilingual facilitator with a moderator guide informed by the literature. Transcripts of the focus groups were entered into qualitative analysis software and a thematic network was developed. RESULT(S): Fifty-six participants were recruited: average age was 68.5 years, 58.9\% were female, 98.2\% were Hispanic, 87.5\% had an annual income of less than \$20,000, 58.9\% had 9th grade education or less, 12.5\% had a discount program, and 5.4\% had no insurance. Barriers to CRC screening included cost, fear, and embarrassment. Facilitators to screening included in-person health education and physician recommendation. Participants preferred the hygienic nature of a stool test collected with a brush and bottle. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, there was a lack of knowledge regarding CRC and significant barriers to CRC screening. A community-based CRC screening program was subsequently developed from our findings.},

	abstract = {Low cervical cancer screening rates among Vietnamese American women have been attributed, in part, to inadequate knowledge about cervical cancer and health beliefs that hinder screening. A community-based educational program was developed to improve knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer screening in this underserved population. It was hypothesized that the program would result in increases in knowledge, as well as enhanced health beliefs and self-efficacy toward obtaining cervical cancer screening. Using a group-randomized design, 1488 women from 30 Vietnamese community-based organizations were assigned to either the intervention (n=816) or control (n=672) conditions. The intervention group received cervical cancer education delivered by bilingual community health educators. Intervention content addressed individual beliefs and expectancies regarding cervical cancer screening (e.g., perceived risk of developing cervical cancer; perceived benefits and barriers to screening; social and cultural norms regarding screening). The control group received general health education, including information about cancer screening. Knowledge and health beliefs were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Among women in the intervention group, overall knowledge about cervical cancer and screening guidelines increased from pre- to post-program (30\% vs. 88\%, p{\textless}0.001), perceived benefits of screening increased (3.50 vs. 4.49, p{\textless}0.001), and perceived barriers to screening decreased (3.13 vs. 2.25, p{\textless}0.001). Changes in knowledge and health beliefs were not observed among women in the control group. A community-based educational program can help increase knowledge about cervical cancer and screening, promote positive changes in women's beliefs about the benefits of cervical cancer screening, and reduce perceived barriers to screening. Such programs may play an important role in addressing health disparities and informing underserved populations about recommended screening tests.},

	abstract = {Aim: This paper describes how the transformation of youth mental health services in the rural Francophone region of the Acadian Peninsula in New Brunswick, Canada, is meeting the five objectives of ACCESS Open Minds. Method(s): Implementation of the ACCESS Open Minds framework of care in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick began in 2016 at a well-established volunteer centre and community-based mental health organization. Through focus groups with youth aged 14 to 22 (n = 13), community mapping was used to describe the youth-related mental health service transformation, followed by thematic analysis, validation by member checking and triangulation. Result(s): Preliminary results show a generally successful implementation of the ACCESS Open Minds model, as evidenced by the transformation of mental health service provision, the enhancement of capacity in human resources and the participation of youth. Transformation was evidenced across the five objectives of mental healthcare of ACCESS Open Minds, albeit to variable extents. Several facilitating factors and challenges are identified based on youths' accounts. Conclusion(s): It is possible to successfully implement the ACCESS Open Minds model among francophones living in a minority setting and despite the constraints of a rural area. Most key components of the framework were implemented with high program fidelity. The rural context presents unique challenges that require creative and effective use of resources, while offering opportunities that arise from a culture of resourcefulness and collaboration.Copyright Â© 2019 The Authors Early Intervention in Psychiatry Published by John Wiley \& Sons Australia, Ltd},

All FG and KII transcripts were analyzed following grounded theory methodology. RESULT(S): Key findings include low awareness of Options; a need for greater community-based outreach efforts; prioritization of access, quality, and affordability of services; and need for activities that address concerns regarding immigrant status and fear of high bills and long-term debt. Program utilization depends on access, affordability, and patient experience factors, with particular emphasis on stigma associated with being poor and un/underinsured.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Increasing treatment uptake among people who inject drugs (PWID) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is integral to eliminating viral hepatitis. This study explored the role of community-based outreach in engaging and retaining Australian PWID in the testing component of the HCV care cascade. DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 PWID, including new initiates to injecting and those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, who acquired HCV infection while enrolled in a community-based prospective observational study of hepatitis C vaccine preparedness in Sydney. Participants were interviewed at diagnosis and 12 months later. Transcripts were thematically analysed using constant comparative techniques. RESULT(S): Community-based outreach was effective in engaging newly infected participants in HCV monitoring and decision-making about seeking interferon-based treatment. Key factors in the acceptability of outreach were privacy and discretion, and opportunities to build trust with non-judgmental staff. Retaining participants in the HCV cascade of care required more than a one-off session of post-test counselling. Ongoing discussions with staff enabled paced and tailored delivery of information about HCV prevention, testing and treatment. Increased understanding of the role of HCV ribonucleic acid viremia in determining the need for treatment, and access to this testing, was pivotal in making HCV monitoring salient for participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Outreach is an effective strategy for engaging new initiates to injecting and CALD PWID in HCV testing and decision-making about treatment. Findings highlight the need to increase availability and access to HCV ribonucleic acid testing for PWID.Copyright Â© 2019 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.},

	abstract = {Latino cancer survivors have lower survival rates for most cancers relative to non-Latino whites, including, colorectal, prostate, and breast. In addition, Latinos experience health disparities in both access to care and quality of care. Experts recommend providing psychosocial services as an integral part of quality cancer care; however, there continues to be a paucity of information on the efficacy of Patient Navigators (PNs) in linking Latino cancer survivors to appropriate psychosocial services. Redes En Accion: The National Latino Cancer Research Network partnered with LIVESTRONG Cancer Navigation Services Patient Navigation program (PN-LCNS) to provide an intervention to improve wellness and increase access to psychosocial services among non-metastatic Latino cancer survivors from Texas and Chicago using trained bilingual, bicultural PNs. The study design involved a mixed-methods approach in two phases. Phase I used a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach wherein PNs engaged community partners who provide services to breast, colorectal and prostate Latino cancer survivors. Phase II was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the efficacy of combining PN-facilitated interventions with the culturally tailored and CBPR-informed PN-LCNS in 300 breast, prostate and colorectal Latino cancer survivors. Outcomes investigated were improvements in: 1) quality of life (QOL), both general and disease-specific, and; 2) treatment follow-up compliance. While limited work has addressed the psychosocial needs of Latino cancer survivors, culturally-competent interventions using PNs have potential to address these needs and significantly improve Latino cancer survivorship.Copyright Â© 2018},

	abstract = {Introduction Depression is the leading cause of adult disability and common among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults. The current study builds on findings showing the effectiveness of depression quality improvement (QI) and delivery of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) skills provided by community health workers in reducing depression. Depression QI approaches across healthcare and social/community services in safety-net settings have shown improvements in mental wellness, mental health quality of life and depression over 12 months. Further, a randomised study showed improved depression among low-income racial/ethnic minorities enrolled in a CBT-informed resiliency class (Building Resilience and Increasing Community Hope (B-RICH)). The current protocol describes a comparativeness effectiveness study to evaluate whether predominantly low-income, SGM racial/ethnic minority adults randomised to a CBT-informed resiliency class have improvements in depressive symptoms over and above community-engaged QI resources and training only. Methods and analysis The study approached three clusters of four to five programs serving predominantly SGM and racial/ethnic minority communities in the USA: two clusters in Los Angeles, California, and one in New Orleans, Louisiana. Clusters are comprised of one primary care, one mental health and two to three community agencies (eg, faith-based, social services/support, advocacy). All programs received depression QI training. The current study employed a community-partnered participatory research model to adapt the CBT-informed resiliency class, B-RICH+, to SGM communities. Study participants were screened and recruited in person from participating programs, and will complete baseline, 6- and 12-month survey follow-ups. Participants were depressed adults (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire {\textgreater}=10; {\textgreater}=18 years of age) who provided contact information. Enrolled participants were individually randomised to B-RICH+ or depression QI alone. Primary outcomes are depressive symptoms; secondary outcomes are mental health quality of life, mental wellness and physical health quality of life. Data collection for this study is ongoing. Ethics and dissemination The current study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Study findings will be disseminated through scientific publications and community conferences.

We used a rapid assessment process to create narrative reports that we examined using thematic analysis to explore differences across sites and between LMSM and LTGW. Lessons learned: requiring smartphone use could diminish participation of poor participants; sending personalized messages on the same days and times can help participants anticipate receiving study information; working with community partners is essential for building trust; recognizing different language literacies and diverse countries of origin can improve the cultural competency of intervention materials.

	abstract = {Objectives The aims of our study were to describe current hepatitis B prevalence among Vietnamese Americans and to examine predictors of hepatitis B risk in this specific ethnic community. Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from a community-based screening program. Setting This analysis was based on hepatitis screening community events in Southern California. Participants 2508 Vietnamese Americans in Southern California. Outcome measures Serological tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody were used to classify participants as one of four hepatitis B infection statuses: currently infected, previously infected, susceptible, or immune due to a previous hepatitis B vaccination. Results Across 2508 participants, 9.0\% were currently infected with hepatitis B and 17.7\% were at risk for hepatitis B. Females and those reporting a previous hepatitis B vaccination were at significant decreased risk of hepatitis B (OR=0.48, 95\% CI 0.33 to 0.69 and OR=0.53, 95\% CI 0.31 to 0.93, respectively) whereas those born outside of the USA and with a family history of the disease showed substantial increased risk (OR=13.36, 95\% CI 1.62 to 110.05 and OR=4.68, 95\% CI 2.66 to 8.22, respectively). Among those who reported a previous hepatitis B vaccination, less than half (42.9\%) possessed the protective antibodies that result from a hepatitis B vaccination. Conclusions Vietnamese Americans remain disproportionately burdened by hepatitis B. Public health efforts that focus on improving hepatitis B awareness and vaccination knowledge and that are tailored to specific high-risk subgroups, such as immigrants and those with infected family members, could help in addressing the disease's burden in this high-prevalence population.Copyright Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

	abstract = {Introduction: Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and screening rates are disproportionately low among Latinos. One factor thought to contribute to the low screening rate is the difficulty Latinos encounter in understanding health information, and therefore in taking appropriate health action. Therefore, we used Boot Camp Translation (BCT), a patient engagement approach, to engage Latino stakeholders (ie, patients, clinic staff) in refining the messages and format of colon cancer screening reminders for a clinic-based direct mail fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) program. Method(s): Patient participants were Latino, ages 50 to 75 years, able to speak English or Spanish, and willing to participate in the in-person kickoff meeting and follow-up phone calls over a 3-month period. We held separate BCT sessions for English- and Spanish-speaking participants. As part of the in-person meetings, a bilingual colon cancer expert presented on colon health and screening messages and BCT facilitators led interactive sessions where participants reviewed materials and reminder messages in various modalities (eg, letter, text). Participants considered what information about colon cancer screening was important, the best methods to share these messages, and the timing and frequency with which these messages should be delivered to patients to encourage FIT completion. We used follow-up phone calls to iteratively refine materials developed based on key learnings from the in-person meeting. Result(s): Twenty-five adults participated in the in-person sessions (English [n 12]; Spanish [n 13]). Patient participants were primarily enrolled in Medicaid/uninsured (76\%) and had annual household incomes less than \$20,000 (67\%). Key themes distilled from the sessions included increasing awareness that screening can prevent colon cancer, stressing the urgency of screening, emphasizing the motivating influence of family, and using personalized messages from the practice such as 'I' or 'we' statements in letters or automated phone call reminders delivered by humans. Participants in both sessions noted the importance of receiving an automated or live alert before a FIT kit is mailed and a reminder within 2 weeks of FIT kit mailing. Discussion(s): Using BCT, we successfully incorporated participant feedback to adapt culturally relevant health messages to promote FIT testing among Latino patients served by community clinics. Materials will be tested in the larger Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention (PROMPT) trial.Copyright Â© 2019 American Board of Family Medicine. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The cultural, linguistic, and religious diversity of Australia's population presents challenges for mental health service delivery. Arabic-speaking communities in Australia underutilise mental health services despite high levels of trauma and psychological distress. Clinicians who work with this population lack linguistically and culturally appropriate clinical resources. The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability and clinical utility of a Mindfulness Skills CD translated into formal Arabic. The 70 participants were Arabic-speaking adults, mostly Lebanese-born Muslim women, who enrolled in a 5-week mindfulness program using the CD and agreed to follow-up at 12 weeks. Both recruitment and data collection were undertaken by a female project officer who is a widely respected member of the Arabic community in south-east Sydney. Compliance with the program protocol was high and all but 4 participants continued to use the CD beyond the 5 weeks. Overall, participants reported that mindfulness techniques fitted well with their way of life and were compatible with their cultural and religious practices. Most found mindfulness complementary to their regular reflective prayer. Using the Mindfulness Skills CD was associated with statistically significant reductions in psychological distress as measured by the Kessler Scale (K10) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21) postprogram (K10; DASS21 Depression and Stress subscales) and at follow-up (all measures). The evaluation showed that the Arabic Mindfulness Skills CD is an effective and culturally appropriate mental health resource for this population group. This low-cost, easily distributed resource is suitable for use in individual self-management and as an adjunct to primary and specialist mental health care.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2019.},

MINI administered 5910 vaccinations through 99 community-based vaccination clinics during the 2017-2018 influenza season and surveyed the clients in their own language about influenza vaccination knowledge and practices. Among those surveyed, 2545 (43.1\%) were uninsured and 408 (6.9\%) received a first-time influenza vaccination at the MINI clinic. A total of 2893 (49.0\%) respondents heard about the clinic through their faith community. Lessons learned included the importance of building relationships with community leaders and involving them as full partners, holding clinics in community-based settings to bring vaccinations to clients, and reporting outcomes to partners.Copyright Â© 2019, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.},

	abstract = {Context: The Canterbury region in Sydney is highly culturally and linguistically diverse, with 45\% of residents speaking a non-English language at home. Services within this region have identified that non-English speaking mothers are less engaged with parenting programs. The first 2000 days of a child's life are critical for future health. As such, engaging non-English speaking migrant families with parenting groups is an important equity issue. Objective(s): We sought to re-design the recruitment processes, structure and content of parenting groups delivered within Sydney Local Health District for two target groups-Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. This project is funded by Healthdirect Australia. Design(s): The intervention was developed in collaboration with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service from Sydney Local Health District and with Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking community members. Setting(s): The new parenting groups will be delivered in Campsie and Lakemba Early Childhood Health Centres (within Sydney Local Health District). Participant(s): Bangla and Mandarin speaking new mothers and grandmothers with a 0-6 month old baby will be invited to attend the new parenting groups. Finding(s): Working with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service and members of the target community enabled a cultural re-design of current parenting program recruitment processes, structure, delivery and content for Bangla- and Mandarin-speaking women. Implication(s) for practice: Working in partnership with the Child and Family Health Nursing Service and the community increases the sustainability of this intervention. If the parenting groups and recruitment processes are successful, they have the potential to be delivered on an ongoing basis.},

	url = {https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2019.199.1_MeetingAbstracts.A3013},
	abstract = {Rationale: Despite substantial investments in research, asthma continues to pose a significant health burden for Hispanics in the US. In NYC, Hispanics have higher asthma prevalence than non-Hispanics (10.9\% vs. 7.4\%), and more than double the rate of ER visits (33.8\% vs.12.8\%). Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) works with community members to define research questions and collaborate on the conduct of the research in order to derive more pertinent research questions with results that may be more readily adopted. We describe the results of collaboration with a community outreach organization to understand Hispanic asthma research needs and misconceptions, and the resulting intervention to improve asthma knowledge. Method(s): Partnering with the community outreach organization, El Poder de Decidir, we conducted 12 Hispanic community asthma meetings to identify research priorities. This was augmented by asthma education literature, and discussions with organizations experienced with Hispanic asthma outreach. Six Hispanic Asthma Community Leaders (ACLs) were trained using educational modules highlighting misconceptions about asthma. Modules were summarized in a brief asthma education card. At the completion of training, ACLs were also asked to react to 4 hypothetical asthma patient scenarios to test their knowledge. ACLs then assembled members from their community for teaching using the brief asthma education card, and observed by members from El Poder de Decidir and a bilingual pulmonologist. Participants completed preand post- asthma knowledge surveys, and results were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test. Result(s): The development of the intervention including the community workshops, education modules and brief asthma education card for ACLs was collaboratively developed over two years. The 6 ACLs were trained over the course of 3 months and were then observed as they taught a total of 104 participants. Among all participants, the mean knowledge score increased from 0.56 (sd 0.18) to 0.85 (sd 0.13) pre- and post- teaching by ACLs (0.282 (95\%CI 0.25-0.31) t(103)=17.62); p=0.0001). At baseline the most commonly missed questions were about asthma symptoms and triggers, and that daily need to use asthma indicated the need for controller medication. Conclusion(s): We have successfully developed and tested an asthma education intervention for the Hispanic community which includes tailored education materials to build on identified misconceptions, and Hispanic ACLs to teach to their own community members. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these results persist among a larger group, what the comparative effectiveness is versus other education-based interventions and the longer term health benefits.},

	abstract = {Background: Patient's adherence to health relevant medical and behavioral recommendations before and after liver transplantation improves clinical outcomes. Therefore, healthcare professionals should provide selfmanagement support and education. In our hospitals, oral counseling sessions are complemented by handing-out written brochures with information and advice. However, in patients with a foreign-language as well as for the education of complex content, it remains a challenge. Our aim was to develop languageindependent illustrations to support counseling of patients before and after liver transplantation. Method(s): We used a participatory action research approach. In two meetings, physicians and nurses from the Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, the University Hospital Zurich and a professional illustrator (only participating in the second meeting) (n=8) engaged in one complete action cycle: 1) constructing, 2) planning, 3) acting, and 4) evaluating. Result(s): In constructing, every participant presented three real clinical practice situations in which illustrations would have facilitated patient counseling. In planning, all situations were discussed and three overriding themes for illustrations were identified: Understanding the disease (e.g., portal hypertension), organizational aspects (e.g. need for medical check-up before listing) and life after transplant (e.g., medication taking). Finally, the group decided to start with four draft illustrations. In acting, the illustrator created drafts and presented them to the healthcare professionals in the second meeting. The group evaluated the drafts using the ?Thinking aloud? technique. Based on these results, the group discussed specific adaptations and agreed to create additional drafts. Finally, twelve illustrations and two illustrated self-observation plans before and after transplantation were drafted. In a second action research cycle, drafts will be evaluated by patients and other health care providers and revised before implementation in practice. Conclusion(s): Early involvement of relevant stakeholders is key in practice development projects and the application of new tools. We expect a high acceptance and use of the illustrations for counseling before and after transplantation. This in turn, might improve safety in deprived patient groups.},

	abstract = {Objective: To conduct a formative evaluation of Phase 1 of the Partners of Refugees in Illinois Disability Employment (PRIDE) program, a federally-funded intervention including culturally-appropriate, bilingual employment trainings to 50 job-seeking refugees with disabilities in Illinois. Design(s): A mixed methods evaluation design comprising qualitative case notes and pre- and post-intervention surveys. Setting(s): Community-based settings in collaboration with disability and refugee-serving agencies, city colleges, and workforce centers. Participants (or Animals, Specimens, Cadavers): Using a referred sampling strategy, 27 refugee adults with disabilities with work authorization in the U.S. have been recruited to date. Of these, all but one have completed the program, and 14 have completed pre and post-intervention surveys for Phase 1. Average age of participants is 40.9 years (range 25-72), with 3 participants identifying as female and 10 as male. Participants represent a wide range of disabilities including physical impairments, sensory impairments, and mental health conditions. Intervention(s): PRIDE includes three phases.The first phase (3-4 weeks), is an employment training involving 3 group workshops staggered with individual person-centered planning sessions. Phase 2 involves opening cases with PRIDE's core partners to connect participants to employment-related resources. In Phase 3, participants are connected with additional resources and employers, depending on their individual employment pathways. Main Outcome Measure(s): Questionnaires were developed to measure perceived helpfulness of Phase I group trainings and partipiants' self-efficacy and knowledge pertaining to disability and employment-related resources and policies in the U.S. Result(s): Majority of the participants (12/14) found the content of PRIDE's Phase 1 group trainings very helpful. Nearly all participants (12/14) would recommend the training sessions to others. Participants' knowledge scores increased from 6.7 (s.d.=2.6) pre-intervention to 8.1 (s.d.=2.9) post-intervention (maximum possible score =13). Before trainings, participants' average self-efficacy rating for taking the steps necessary to achieve their desired job was 54.9 (s.d.=29.9) on a scale from 1-100. Post-training, the average rating increased to 62.7 (s.d.=34.5). Common barriers to employment include lack of timely and linguistically-appropriate access to key services (e.g. Social Security benefits counseling). Conclusion(s): Phase 1 of the PRIDE program was acceptable to participants and shows promise for increasing self-efficacy and knowledge pertaining to disability and employment-related topics. The extent to which these improvements translate to positive employment outcomes needs to be evaluated upon completion of all phases of the program with the target sample of 50 participants.

	abstract = {Background: Community outreach is commonly used to disseminate cancer prevention and screening guidelines (CPSG). Minority, immigrant populations with language barriers tend to be excluded from these activities due to the lack of bilingual professionals available to deliver this education. This program was aimed to test whether CPSG education improves knowledge after being taught by an English-speaking medical professional and nonmedical, community-based interpreters working in South Asian and Hispanic communities in New York City (NYC). Method(s): Team members from two cancer centers and community-based minority organizations in NYC partnered to create and deliver programs on CPSG to linguistically diverse communities by an English-speaking medical professional utilizing community-based interpreters. Participant knowledge was assessed using matched pre-post surveys in participants' respective languages. Behavioral intention was measured using a Likert scale from 1-4 with anchors at 1) "Will not do it" and 4) "Already have/doing it". Paired t-tests were used to compare pre to post mean score and a p-value {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Behavioral intention rated positively if participants endorsed "will do it" or "already doing" the healthy behavior. Result(s): 188 community dwelling adults participated in 5 educational sessions, 122 completing pre and post assessments. Median age was 68, two thirds (69\%) were female. 94\% were born outside of the US, coming from 12 different countries, speaking 6 different primary languages. Knowledge increased from an average of 33\% correct responses pre-session to 63\% correct post-session-a statistically significant change (t(121) =-10.58, p {\textless}.001). Behavioral intention scores reveal 83-96\% participants reporting they will continue to or plan to seek screening and screening information from their doctors as well as make lifestyle changes related to decreasing their cancer risk. Conclusion(s): This program demonstrates CPSG can not only be taught in English with use of interpreters, but can be successfully received by immigrant community participants who historically may not have these programs available to them due to language barriers.},

	abstract = {Background: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and members of Chinese-Canadian communities have been found to be at significant risk of excess smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There currently exists a lack of culturally relevant smoking-cessation materials for both Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities that must be addressed. Objective(s): Our study aimed to explore the cultural context of smoking practices and smoking-cessation within Mandarin and Cantonese speaking communities, and to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to successful smoking cessation. We also endeavour to understand the acceptance and efficacy of a proposed culturally and linguistically appropriate smoking-cessation program. Method(s): A quantitative cross-sectional study was undertaken in the form of a community-based exploratory study. Information obtained from this research was enriched through consultations with health care and smoking-cessation professionals. Focus groups were then conducted with a number of current smokers from target communities. This information was then applied during the development of a series of culturally and linguistically appropriate educational materials. Result(s): Our study qualitatively assessed factors influencing smoking onset, continuation and cessation amongst respondents (n = 168). Access to cigarettes and a general cultural approval of smoking played an important role in participants' smoking-onset. For male participants, familial and peer influence was perceived as a major factor for smoking continuation, while females claimed stress to be the greatest determinant. For younger smokers, smoking-cessation information delivery is critical and must account for their specific smoking patterns. Younger people responded they were not heavily influenced by pictorial warnings on cigarette packages, but would be influenced by social media trends and broadcasts. Older smokers often attempted quitting multiple times but struggled to maintain cessation. Participants were more willing to discuss individual smoking habits with a consultant from their culture, who spoke their language and understood cultural norms pertaining to smoking practices. Conclusion(s): Increasing access to and standard of culturally relevant smoking-cessation materials and programs may lead to an increase in smoking-cessation practices. Engaging community members and professionals during the development and implementation of culturally and linguistically comprehensive smoking-cessation interventions may facilitate behavioural modifications and changes in smoking habits within ethnic minority communities.},

Background(s): Widespread community engagement in advance care planning (ACP) is achievable in community settings through multi-faceted approaches, as supported by implementation literature. Aim Statement: To adapt an ACP group visit model to increase ACP engagement in rural underserved Colorado communities. Method(s): Our statewide rural initiative utilizes patient navigators (PNs) to facilitate ACP conversations in churches, libraries, schools, businesses, nursing homes, clinics, local government districts, and area health education centers. Two bilingual lay PNs trained in an ACP group session framework facilitated one-hour English and Spanish sessions in a comfortable, confidential space. Participants receive bilingual informational materials including Frequently Asked Questions, an easy-to-read Advance Directive (AD) (www.prepareforyourcare.org), and goal setting worksheets. Participants are encouraged to discuss their understanding and concerns about choosing a medical decision maker and completing a comprehensive AD. Participants are invited to complete the ACP Engagement survey (ACP-4) immediately post session. Result(s): To date, we conducted 67 community-based sessions engaging 929 participants; 64.6\% female, 42\% ethnically diverse. Post session ACP-4 (51\% response rate) showed 28\% planned on naming a decision maker in the next 6 months and 22\% in the next 30 days; 25\% were ready to talk about future healthcare decisions with their decision maker in the next 6 months and 22\% in the next 30 days; 31\% were ready to talk to their provider about healthcare preferences in the next 6 months and 16\% in the next 30 days; 31\% were ready to complete an AD in the next 6 months and 23\% in the next 30 days. Evaluations showed 56\% were extremely satisfied, 43\% were satisfied, with 98\% reporting the session was the right length of time. Conclusions and Implications: PNs effectively engaged underserved and ethnically diverse rural Colorado populations in community-based settings. Our model can be readily adapted by other healthcare settings to improve ACP in underserved populations.Copyright Â© 2018},

	abstract = {Significant evidence demonstrates the powerful effects social determinants have on health-related perceptions, behaviors, and health outcomes. However, these factors are often studied out of context, despite the acknowledgement that social determinants of health are place based. This research aimed to demonstrate that health-related perceptions are dependent on where one lives. Via a community-based participatory study, participants were randomly selected from 3 residential regions varying distances from a freight railyard (nearest n = 300, middle n = 338, farthest n = 327), all mostly low-income, predominately Latino areas. Interview-administered surveys with adults were collected by bilingual trained community members (87\% response) in English/Spanish. Adjusted-logistic regression models assessed residential region as a predictor of stressors (perceptions of community safety, community noise disturbance, health care access, food insecurity) and buffers (3 neighborhood cohesion variables), after adjusting for household income, race/ethnicity, gender, and age. Each region experienced a unique amalgam of stressors and buffers. In general, the region closest to the railyard experienced more stressors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58; 95\% CI 1.12-2.20) and less buffers (OR = 0.69; 95\% CI 0.49-0.96) than the region furthest from the railyard. More than half of participants in each region reported 2 or more stressors and 2 or more buffers. In this seemingly homogenous study population, place remained important in spite of traditionally used socioeconomic factors, such as household income and race/ethnicity. Social determinants of health should be studied with regard to their environmental context, which will require interdisciplinary collaboration to improve multilevel research methods. Including the study of social buffers will also promote sustainable, positive change to reduce health disparities.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive strategies for prescription drug misuse must reach culturally and linguistically diverse suburban populations to effectively combat the ongoing opioid epidemic. The purpose of this study was to conduct a community needs assessment and inform the development and implementation of culturally appropriate primary prevention strategies for community-based interventions, specifically related to medication disposal practices. Three data collection techniques were utilized: key informant interviews (n=4), intercept surveys (n=71), and focus group discussions (n=8; 61 participants). To accommodate linguistically diverse subpopulations, surveys and focus groups were available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, and Hindi. Participants were overwhelmingly female (survey: 70\%/FGD: 84\%), ethnic minorities (survey: 61\%/FGD: 66\%), and, on average, middle-aged [survey: 52 years (SD: 19)/FGD: 54 (15)]. Approximately one in three survey respondents (30\%) had heard of drug-take back events, and one in ten (10\%) had participated. Non-English speakers were less likely to both perceive a community problem with prescription drugs (beta=-.35; p{\textless}.001) and be aware of take-back opportunities (beta=-.23; p=.038). Focus group participants expressed confusion about appropriate medication disposal methods, identifying potential sources of conflicting information. Recent media coverage and political events have heightened stigma towards non-English speaking and non-native peoples, increasing their fear of law enforcement and other perceived threats. To encourage community engagement in take-back events, we identified multiple ways, such as multilingual materials and marketing campaigns, which may help marginalized suburban subpopulations feel less threatened and more included in prescription drug misuse prevention activities.},

Nine student mentors were recruited and paired with academics for a three-month 'mentorship partnership' intervention. Data from two pre-intervention workshops and a post-intervention workshop were coded in NVivo11 using thematic analysis. Drawing on social inclusion theory, a qualitative analysis explored an iteration of themes across each action cycle. Emergent themes were: 1) 'building relationships for active engagement', 2) 'voicing cultural and social hierarchies', and 3) 'enacting collegiate community'.

Research within this population is lacking, in part, due to researchers' use of methodologies that are inaccessible to Deaf sign language users. Traditional qualitative methods were developed to collect and analyze participants' spoken language. There is, therefore, a paradigm shift that must occur to move from an auditory data schema to one that prioritizes the collection and analysis of visual data. To effectively navigate this shift when working with Deaf sign language users, there are unique linguistic and sociopolitical considerations that should be taken into account. The current article explores these considerations and outlines an emerging method of conducting qualitative analysis that, we argue, has the potential to enhance qualitative researchers' work regardless of the population of focus.},

Peer programs have been effective in HIV outreach and prevention but effectiveness of such programs for retention in care and viral suppression is understudied. Subjects (n = 348) were randomized in equal allocation to a peer navigation and education intervention versus standard clinical care at three urban clinics in the United States. The intervention group received seven structured interventions plus weekly contact to address medical and social needs. Primary outcomes included time-to-first 4-month gap in HIV care and viral suppression up to 12 months of follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between groups on 4-month gap in HIV primary care, but subgroup analysis showed a suggestive effect of the peer intervention in reducing gaps in care among stably housed subjects. Fully compliant subjects in the peer intervention experienced significantly fewer 4-month gaps in HIV primary care (p {\textless} 0.0001). Those in the peer group who had more clinical face-to-face encounters in the first 3 months were also significantly more likely to have better retention in care (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences between any study subgroups in viral suppression at 12 months. Peer interventions may improve retention in primary care among subgroups of people living with HIV from racial/ethnic minority communities, although such improved retention may not increase viral load suppression. Attending and completing structured educational sessions along with early, intensive contact with peers could improve retention in HIV primary care for patients. Future peer programs should consider training on housing referral systems to help increase retention for patients who are not stably housed. clinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT01616940.},

(b) Contextual aspects (i.e. local ideology, Mexican media, underfunded schools, permissive law enforcement in bars, lack of bilingual providers) place Hispanic/Latina female adolescents at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy. (c) Gender roles perpetuate inequality and deepen Hispanic/Latina females' vulnerability to unplanned pregnancy.

	abstract = {Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, and institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever-growing need in a culturally sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community-based, culturally tailored models of care that have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment. We have developed a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill Latinos. We describe the protocol for a National Institute of Nursing Research-funded randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention. We aim to enroll 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness from both urban and rural clinical sites. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group (five palliative care patient navigator visits plus bilingual educational materials) or control group (usual care plus bilingual educational materials). Outcomes include quality of life (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy), advance care planning (Advance Care Planning Engagement survey), pain (Brief Pain Inventory), symptom management (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised), hospice utilization, and cost and utilization of healthcare resources. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory-driven, innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate health equity in palliative and end-of-life care.Copyright Â© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

METHOD(S): Insure Detroit, a partnership between researchers and community-based organizations, was established. Principles of CBPR were followed closely in the conduct of this project. The Insure Detroit partnership developed the intervention and evaluation plan through an iterative process. The Insuring Good Health intervention is multilingual and composed of a responsive website. It includes nine short, animated videos informed by storytelling techniques that communicate key learning points pertaining to health insurance navigation and use. LESSONS LEARNED: Lessons learned included narrowing learning points for the intervention, balancing the volume of work to comply with the study timeline, and balancing the political climate with the development of the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): The Insure Detroit partnership demonstrates that a CBPR approach can develop media-based health communications to address health insurance literacy.

This study examined the effect of a family-based treatment program embedded in a primary care clinic on retention and changes in child weight status at 1 year. METHOD(S): Children (2-16 years, BMI {\textgreater}=85th percentile, 87.0\% Hispanic) and their parents were recruited from a single pediatric clinic for Healthy Hawks Primary Plus (HHP+). Children were referred by physicians and enrolled by a bilingual clinic-based recruitment coordinator. Participants received 12 weekly 2-hour sessions focused on lifestyle modification and health behavior change and then received bimonthly follow-up visits with their clinic-based physician through 1-year follow-up. Child body mass index (BMI) percentage of the 95th percentile (\%BMIp95) was measured as the primary outcome at baseline, postintervention, and 1-year follow-up. Random effect multilevel models assessed changes in child weight status over time accounting for clustering by family. To further evaluate the impact, HHP+ retention and changes in child weight status were compared to a standard 12-week treatment program only. RESULT(S): HHP+ participants had significantly better retention at 1 year (73.9\%, p{\textless}=0.001) compared to the standard treatment program (38.3\%). In HHP+, physician visit attendance was significantly correlated with retention at 1 year (r=0.69, p{\textless}=0.001), and HHP+ completers had significant reductions in \%BMIp95 between baseline and 1-year follow-up (p=0.03).

	abstract = {Introduction: Milwaukee, a city characterized by high rates of racial segregation and a growing immigrant population, has large race-based breast cancer survival disparities. To address these disparities, breast health education workshops were offered through a community-academic partnership (CAP) to women from various ethnic backgrounds. This paper explores attendance, satisfaction, and rates of screening mammography among workshop attendees. Method(s): Partnerships were formed with community-based organizations, a mobile mammography unit, and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program, a state-supported program providing free mammograms. Multilingual staff provided monthly breast health education workshops at community settings and coordinated transportation. Participants completed surveys that included demographics, prior screening history, barriers to screening, and program evaluation. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and analyze data. Result(s): Over a 24-month period, 493 women-most of whom sought services at partnering organizations that serve primarily immigrants, refugees, and racial minorities-attended breast health workshops, with 374 participants completing surveys (mean age = 45 years). A total of 360 were {\textgreater}= 40 years old. Among these women, 188 (113 insured [60\%], 75 uninsured [40\%]) reported no prior mammogram in the past 2 to 5 years. After attending the workshop, mammogram uptake was 100\% among the insured and 80\% among the uninsured. Satisfaction with the workshops was high; 73\% of attendees rated them highly informative. Conclusion(s): Our CAP offered culturally tailored breast health education and access to screening via a mobile unit that was well attended, highly rated, and increased screening mammography.Copyright Â© 2018 Wisconsin Medical Society.},

	abstract = {Objective To identify research priorities of consumers and other stakeholders to inform Cochrane Reviews in 'health communication and participation' (including such concepts as patient experience, shared decision-making and health literacy). Setting International. Participants We included anyone with an interest in health communication and participation. Up to 151 participants (18-80 years; 117 female) across 12 countries took part, including 48 consumers (patients, carers, consumer representatives) and 75 professionals (health professionals, policymakers, researchers) (plus 25 people who identified as both). Design Survey. Methods We invited people to submit their research ideas via an online survey open for 4 weeks. Using inductive thematic analysis, we generated priority research topics, then classified these into broader themes. Results Participants submitted 200 research ideas, which we grouped into 21 priority topics. Key research priorities included: Insufficient consumer involvement in research (19 responses), 'official' health information is contradictory and hard to understand (18 responses), communication/coordination breakdowns in health services (15 responses), health information provision a low priority for health professionals (15 responses), insufficient eliciting of patient preferences (14 responses), health services poorly understand/implement patient-centred care (14 responses), lack of holistic care impacting healthcare quality and safety (13 responses) and inadequate consumer involvement in service design (11 responses). These priorities encompassed acute and community health settings, with implications for policy and research. Priority populations of interest included people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, carers, and people with low educational attainment, or mental illness. Most frequently suggested interventions focused on training and cultural change activities for health services and health professionals. Conclusions Consumers and other stakeholders want research addressing structural and cultural challenges in health services (eg, lack of holistic, patient-centred, culturally safe care) and building health professionals' communication skills. Solutions should be devised in partnership with consumers, and focus on the needs of vulnerable groups.Copyright Â© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.},

	abstract = {Background: Against the background of linguistic and cultural differences, there is a need for translation and adaptation from the English version of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) to Japanese. In addition, there is no study of inter-rater reliability of FMA all domains for affected upper extremities with appropriate sample size based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) focusing on non-simultaneous assessment. Objective(s): This study aimed (1) to translate the English version of the FMA and its administration/scoring manual; and (2) to investigate the psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the FMA in patients with stroke. Method(s): A prospective single-center study involving 30 patients was conducted. The FMA and the Action Research Arm Test, the Box-and-Block Test, and the Motor Activity Log were employed. The inter-rater/intra-rater reliability, the internal consistency, the validity, and the floor/ceiling effects were assessed. Result(s): Regarding the non-simultaneous and simultaneous inter-rater reliability, ICC ranged from 0.809-0.983 (P{\textless}0.001) and 0.991-0.999 (P{\textless}0.001), respectively. Regarding the simultaneous intra-rater reliability, ICC ranged from 0.994-0.999 (P{\textless}0.001). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.973 in the non-simultaneous evaluation and 0.981 in the simultaneous evaluation. Regarding the validity, Spearman's rhos were higher than 0.92 for the FMA all domains and motor domain. The patients who showed the highest score and the lowest score of the FMA (all domains and motor domain) were 10\% and 0\%, respectively. Conclusion(s): The Japanese version of the FMA motor domain and all domains can reliably assess the affected upper extremities in patients with mild-to-severe hemiparesis after stroke for both non-simultaneous and simultaneous assessment.Copyright Â© 2018, Â© 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To develop a community-based educational workshop to improve medication health literacy in refugees. Setting(s): Workshops were provided in community locations including a local resettlement agency and English as a Second Language facility. Practice description: Pharmacy faculty mentored small group student workshop presentations to recently arrived refugees regarding medication health literacy topics. Practice innovation: A program was developed to use translated materials, interpreters, hands-on materials, and evaluations to teach refugees about medication-related issues. A needs assessment was conducted with a local refugee resettlement agency to determine topics. Evaluation: Evaluations were administered after the workshop to ensure understanding of the workshop material. Verbal feedback and faculty oversight during interactions between pharmacy students and refugees in addition to evaluation responses were used for quality improvement. Result(s): Workshop materials have been translated into 11 of the most common languages for our local refugee population. Twelve workshops were administered during the past year and a half, educating 282 refugees from 33 countries. There was an average of 78\% correct responses on postevaluation questions assessing refugees' understanding of workshop concepts. Verbal feedback from the refugees supported an increase in knowledge regarding how to open a medication bottle, how to read medication labels, and how to dose liquid medications. Conclusion(s): Implementation of this health literacy program allowed us to address medication-related concerns with refugees. Working within the community setting provided a learning environment in which the refugees trusted the workers and were comfortable asking questions. Small group settings and evaluation allowed us to review concepts until proficiency was achieved.Copyright Â© 2018},

	abstract = {Purpose: and Objectives: The risk of diseases associated with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is higher for Hispanics living in the northeastern United States than for other racial and ethnic groups. Higher risk of diabetes, high blood lipids, obesity and limited access to continuity of care are all factors that also contribute to disproportionately poorer chronic disease outcomes for Hispanics. Intervention approach: This article describes the planning and implementation of, and evaluation plans for the Vida Sana Program (VSP), a community-based group intervention created to address the identified MetS risks by encouraging healthier diet and physical activity behaviors among a low-income, largely Spanish speaking, and literacy limited uninsured population. Developed in response to recent calls for culturally-tailored interventions, VSP is conducted by trained bicultural/bilingual Navegantes, who deliver a culturally sensitive, fun and engaging eight-week, in-person educational series through group meetings. The intervention also includes a 40-page colorful, picture and graphic enhanced booklet to be used in the group setting and at home. The intervention focused on screening for MetS-associated disease risk factors, understanding chronic disease management, encouraging medication adherence, increasing physical activity, and healthful dietary changes such as limiting alcohol, sodium, unhealthy fats and excess carbohydrate intake, while emphasizing portion control, whole grains and healthy fats. Conclusion(s): This creative, community-based approach fills an important gap in the community and in the public health literature, is well liked by health literacy limited patients, and will provide an important model of successfully engaging the Hispanic community on these important health issues.Copyright Â© 2018},

	abstract = {Introduction: Evidence based medicine (EBM) is increasingly embraced by complementary and alternative medicine. Academics from China, Australia and UK developed a Summer School EBM course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) students in China. Method(s): An action research approach was used to evaluate the effects of an international collaborative approach to improve learning and teaching. A systematic analysis of an EBM course conducted in 2015 with (66) students and (16) teacher/assistants was used to inform the 2016 course design. Before and after implementation of the 2016 course, (10) teacher/assistant and (20) student pre-/post-course survey responses were recorded to measure attitudes, knowledge and intention to apply EBM in TCM practice. Focus groups, teachers' diaries, field notes and survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Result(s): Changes made in the 2016 course include changing topic focus, catering for different language abilities and varying the learning format. Students and teachers found the course engaging and relevant. Chinese teachers adopted interactive teaching methods and believed they improved student engagement and learning. Teachers reported teaching EBM to TCM students in English was challenging but benefited from the experience. Students embraced the concepts of EBM and performed beyond their and their teachers' expectations. Conclusion(s): Cross-cultural collaboration in teaching a culturally challenging topic in a foreign language using unfamiliar teaching methods is demanding However, utilisation of an action research model can result in positive student evaluation and change in teacher beliefs and practice through sharing reflections and ideas.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Purpose: The racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. population has undergone significant changes with Asian Pacific Islanders being the fastest growing population. Furthermore, the number of immigrant children has doubled in the past two decades, and a quarter of U.S. children are estimated to have at least one foreign-born parent. Despite such increases in immigrant populations and ethnic diversity, the current literature focuses primarily on African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, with analyses of health inequalities among recent ethnic and immigrant groups from Asia relatively uncommon. Compared to their white counterparts, Korean children are more likely to be rated by parents to be in fair or poor health, to lack health insurance, and to have had no well child, even after adjusting for socioeconomic differences in both children and adults. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify barriers and enabling factors that influence healthcare access and utilization in pediatric population of Korean descent in an urban Midwest community. Method(s): The current study used qualitative methods to explore the experiences of Korean parents and their understanding and use of the healthcare system for their children. Four focus groups were conducted in the language of their preference. A semi-structured facilitator-guide was used to guide questions on cultural influences on health care decisions and interactions and utilization of health services. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Using NVIVO, the researchers coded and identified recurring themes. A model will be developed to characterize the findings. Result(s): Themes focused on language barriers in health care interactions, including a lack of knowledge of interpreter services, poor quality of such services, and variability in physician inquiry regarding the need for such services. Among participants who previously lived in Korea, a theme arose concerning barriers and frustration of obtaining healthcare secondary to perceived healthcare costs, longer wait-times involved in scheduling as well as during appointments, and lack of physician understanding on common Korean home remedies. Parents also reffected on the difference in healthcare between Korean and the United States systems with many aspects felt to be more easily obtainable in Korea. Another theme centered on the participants understanding of primary care as it relates to the importance of anticipatory guidance, attainment of well-child checks, and utilization of immediate care facilities. Parents discussed their dependence on friends and community-based organization as the primary source of medical information. Conclusion(s): Korean children may experience unique barriers to health care access. These findings merit additional research to further examine these barriers and establish quality improvement efforts within the community. Community resources aimed to empower ethnically and linguistically diverse population as well as a more nuanced and inquisitive cultural competency training within healthcare system are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Youth violence is a significant public health issue affecting youth who present to pediatric emergency departments. Racially and ethnically diverse populations, in particular, African American and Latino youth, are over-represented in the group of patients who present with firearm, stabbing and assault injuries to emergency departments. Youth victims of violence offer special challenges to provision of care given the extent of their injuries, the psychosocial aspects of an intentional injury, and the potential for seeking retribution. Program Description: For over twenty years, Project Ujima has served youth presenting to the Emergency Department/Trauma Center at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. Youth ages 7 to 18 years are eligible for services if they have sustained an injury due to firearm, stabbing or physical assault. Community liaisons, who are employed by the hospital and on call, come to the emergency department (ED) and meet with the youth and their family members and obtain consent for program participation acutely following an injury. Community liaisons live in affected communities, are trained in cultural sensitivity, and, in some cases, are bilingual. If the youth are hospitalized, the community liaison visits the youth and family daily. When the youth is discharged, either from the ED or from the inpatient unit, home visits are arranged. Program services include: crisis management, mental health services, provision of resources, assistance with obtaining crime victim funds, and school and court advocacy. Once the youth and family have been physically and emotionally stabilized, they are invited to family and youth groups including a 6 week summer day camp and community-based family events. A group of twenty youth provide program direction through Project Ujima's youth leadership team whose guiding principles include promoting youth resilience, cultural sensitivity, community building, and building upon the strengths of each youth and their family. Emphasis is placed on providing services tailored to the needs of each youth and family member. The program also serves survivors in the Milwaukee community who have lost a family member to homicide or who have been affected by domestic violence, robbery, or other crimes. Services are partially funded through a grant via the Department of Justice Victim of Crime Act. Result(s): Over the past 20 years, over 6,000 youth and their families have received services through Project Ujima. Seventy-five per cent of the youth are African American, 10\% Latino and 15\% White, with 70\% of youth being male. In one study of the program, youth participating in Project Ujima had a 1\% repeat violent injury rate, while youth not participating had an 8\% repeat violent injury rate. Patient reported outcomes are currently being utilized to further evaluate program impact. The program is one of the founding members of the National Network on Hospital-Based Violence Intervention Programs (NNHVIP) and provides mentorship to hospitals that are interested in serving diverse populations. Conclusion(s): Youth from diverse populations who are affected by violence have been successfully served in a pediatric emergency department and in their communities by Project Ujima.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization recommends that treatment for psychosis begin within 3 months of symptom onset. However, dozens of studies worldwide have observed an average delay of 2 years between appearance of psychotic symptoms and treatment initiation. Two meta-analyses and the U.S. Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode-Early Treatment Program have established that duration of untreated psychosis (DUP)-the time from psychosis onset to treatment initiation-is correlated with poor clinical and functional outcomes. Early psychosis treatment programs are increasingly available in the U.S., but many in need are missing this critical opportunity. Accordingly, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launched a research program to identify sources of early psychosis treatment delay and test practical and innovative strategies for reducing DUP in the U.S. This symposium features findings from a selection of these studies. Steven Lopez will report on the impact of a community-based, multi-level, bilingual psychosis communication campaign for U.S. Latinos on help seeking, DUP and treatment continuation. Vinod Srihari will report findings from the trial of Mindmap-a populationbased, multi-element, early psychosis detection campaign-on help seeking and DUP. Cameron Carter will present results from his trial assessing whether adding a novel, technology-enhanced early psychosis screening tool to standard provider education for early psychosis increases early psychosis identification and reduces DUP. Leslie Marino will present findings on a comprehensive set of DUP predictors for nearly 800 individuals enrolled in early psychosis treatment programs. Susan Azrin will discuss these findings and implications for developing practical DUP reduction strategies.},

	doi = {10.1158/1538-7755.DISP17-A13},
	abstract = {Introduction: Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and screening rates are disproportionately low among Latinos. In 2015, only 63\% of eligible adults, and 50\% of Latinos, were up to date with colon cancer screening recommendations. One factor thought to contribute to the low screening rate is that patientfacing health information for Latinos is difficult to understand and patients face challenges in taking appropriate health action. As part of the Participatory Research to Advance Colon Cancer Prevention (PROMPT) study that seeks to raise rates of colon cancer screening in a Latino-serving community health center in California, we used boot camp translation (BCT), a validated community-based participatory strategy, to elicit input from diverse stakeholders and refine the messages and format of colon cancer screening reminders for a clinic-based direct mail fecal immunochemical test (FIT) program. Method(s): We adapted BCT to engage Latino patients and clinic staff in this research. Eligible patient participants were Latino, aged 50 to 75 years, able to speak English or Spanish, and willing to participate in a 6-hour in-person meeting and three 30-minute follow-up phone calls. Materials were developed in English and Spanish, and separate sessions were held for English- and Spanish-speaking participants. As part of the in-person sessions, a national bilingual colon cancer expert delivered a presentation on colon health, cancer screening, and messages to improve screening participation, specific to Latino populations. Following the presentation, BCT experts facilitated brainstorming sessions to obtain feedback on the presented information, followed by an interactive small-group session where participants reviewed sample written materials and reminder messages using various modalities (e.g., text, letter, automated and live calls). We asked participants to consider what information about colon cancer screening is important to share with other patients, what the best methods are to share these messages, and the frequency with which these messages should be delivered to patients to encourage FIT completion. Participants then engaged in a hands-on exercise to share input about the timing and frequency of reminder delivery. Results from the exercise were used to define the intervention for the PROMPT pilot. Result(s): A total of 25 adults participated in an in-person session (12 in the English-language session; 13 in the Spanish-language session). Participants were mostly clinic patients (84\%) and the majority were female (80\%). Among the patient participants, 57\% were enrolled in Medicaid, and 67\% reported an annual household income of less than \$20,000. Key themes from the sessions included increasing awareness about colon cancer and screening options, stressing the urgency of screening, and using personalized messages such as ?I? statements in letters or human voices on automated phone call reminders. Both sessions noted the importance of receiving an alert (automated or live) before the FIT kit is mailed, and of receiving a reminder within 2 weeks of FIT kit mailing. Conclusion(s): Our BCT process allowed English- and Spanish-speaking Latino patients to directly inform which approaches get tested in the pilot study by refining message content and selecting their modality and timing to encourage patients who are mailed a FIT to complete it and mail it back. Using BCT, we successfully incorporated participant feedback to design culturally relevant health messages to promote FIT testing among patients served by community clinics.},

	volume = {24},
	doi = {10.1111/hae.13478},
	abstract = {Introduction and Objectives: In the realm of bleeding disorders (BD), knowledge translation (KT) is a constant challenge. Patients without an adequate understanding of their disease are not aware of the mechanisms of the pathology, treatment options, and the importance of treatment. A good use of Information and communication technologies (ICT) could help remedy this problem. This project intends to facilitate KT pertaining to the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of BD, prognosis, treatment options and the importance of treatment for patients with coagulopathies; and to give patients from NMOs around the world the opportunity to further develop their understanding of their pathology, making them patient experts who will be able to help educate their peers. Material(s) and Method(s): After a survey of the most important concepts relating to BD, a series of 5 minute YouTube videos will be developed. These videos will be hosted on a website named the International Hemophilia Knowledge Translation Program (HemoKT). It will contain a community-driven wiki, a forum, useful links and a FAQ page. This material will be developed by two hemophilia patients (both authors). The website will be translated into multiple languages by collaborating hemophilia patients in different regions of the world. All video content in each different language will be reviewed by qualified hematologists who will be identified on the website. Result(s): This is an ongoing project. Two videos on hemophilia and three on von Willebrand disease have already been produced and have been published on YouTube. The videos total 3,719 views; 57\% of the views were by males; the age group that most viewed included between 35 and 44 years, followed by the population aged 25 to 34 years, and the population aged 45 to 54 years. Conclusion(s): The high number of views obtained for the first videos demonstrate that there is a need for KT in the BD community, and that engaged and informed patients are well positioned to accomplish this task using ICT. During the 2018 World Congress, the project team will present the first version of the HemoKT website (in Portuguese and English) and current statistics.},

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Introduction: Inadequate sleep is highly prevalent among socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities, and is often related to sleep health behaviors, stress, and adverse environmental conditions. While socio-contextually appropriate sleep health education and yoga interventions may improve sleep and mitigate adverse effects and reactivity to environmental stressors, there is scant research specifically addressing how to effectively deliver these interventions in underrepresented communities. Method(s): We conducted a pilot study of a combined sleep health and yoga intervention among racially/ethnically diverse adults residing in low-income housing communities, who reported sleeping less than 6 hours a night (n=23). The intervention consisted sequentially of: one group sleep health education session (1-hour), one telephone coaching session (15 minutes), and four weekly 1-hour yoga classes. Twotailed Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests assessed pre- and post-intervention changes in self-reported sleep duration, scores from the PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment and Sleep Disturbance Short Forms, Sleep Hygiene Index, and validated stress and mood assessments. Quantitative and qualitative data assessed intervention acceptability. Result(s): Mean participant age was 41.4 years +/- 19.6; 80.7\% were female; 61.5\% identified as non-Hispanic Black and less than 20\% had a college degree. Results showed significant pre/post intervention improvements in sleep duration (5.3 +/- 0.9 hours/night versus 7.2 +/- 1.7 hours/night [p=.02]), sleep-related impairment (p=.002), sleep disturbance (p=.002), and sleep health behaviors (p=.021). Attendance (100\% received sleep health education; 47.8\% attended at least 2 of 4 yoga classes), intervention feedback scores (73.7\% rated the sleep education session as helpful or very helpful; 63.2\% strongly agreed that the yoga class left them feeling relaxed and less stressed), and qualitative data (e.g., "What I liked least about the program was when it ended, because it was so good?) support the acceptability of the intervention. Conclusion(s): Pilot study results indicate intervention acceptability and promising effects on improvement of sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, and sleep health behaviors. A larger, randomized control trial is planned to elucidate and disentangle the effects of sleep health education and yoga practice on sleep.},

	doi = {10.1177/0269216318769196},
	abstract = {Background: End of life care takes place in a variety of non-cancer settings but how to ensure access for all patients who could benefit is less well understood than for people dying with cancer. There are inequalities in outcomes and access to care for people of South Asian ethnicity living with kidney disease in the UK and reducing these are priorities for policy makers, patients and practitioners. Action research methodology brings together investigation and practice for service improvement. Method(s): Using action research and working with renal clinicians at four NHS sites in the UK, primary data about access and experience of end of life care was collected through focus groups with 45 care providers and individual interviews with 16 South Asian patients with ESKF. 7 bilingual interviewers who conducted patient interviews also took part in a focus group providing feedback on the research process. Researcher reflection and analysis from the 3 qualitative data sources were synthesised thematically to produce a theory building model from this project. Result(s): Thirteen iterative themes described the overarching learning from the research process. The model was in a spiral form with each theme a step in the theory building process. Two dimensions: putting evidence into practice; and ethical care underpinned good practice in end of life kidney care. This analysis of the action research process suggested greater integration of research with practice in communicating about end of life care with patients and their families early on in the end of life phase could be a means to reduce inequalities in access. This has implications for the training of kidney care providers to conduct therapeutic exploratory interviews and for kidney care teams to include bilingual support for patients, both requiring cultural change in practice. Conclusion(s): Exploratory action research is a useful vehicle for building a theoretical base with which to understand and improve access and cultural competency in context. In complex and sensitive healthcare scenarios such as end of life kidney care, action research could facilitate closer integration of research and practice and become a culturally competent element of care.},

The relationship between CAC volume and density with HF is unknown. Method(s): We studied 6814 participants in a multi-ethnic, community-based cohort, free from clinical CVD at recruitment. CAC volume and density were measured by non-contrast CARDIAC CT at the baseline exam (2000-2002). Adjudicated HF events were assessed through 2014, and analysis limited to those with imaging confirmation and estimated ejection fraction (EF). Cox proportional hazard was used to estimate independent associations of baseline CAC volume and density with incident HF: HF with reduced ({\textless} 50\%), and preserved EF (HFrEF \& HFpEF respectively). Result(s): The mean age was 62+10 years, 47\% were men, 38\% identified as European-, 28\% as African-, 22\% as Hispanic-, and 12\% as Chinese-ethnicity. Average time to 189 HF events (119 HFrEF \& 70 HFpEF) was 6.6 years. In unadjusted models, higher CAC volume (HR 1.27 [1.02-1.59], p=0.03), but not CAC density (HR 0.87 [0.67-1.13], p=0.29) was significantly associated with incident HF, non-significant associations were observed with HFrEF, or HFpEF, and no significant associations were observed for all three outcomes after adjustments for demographics and CVD risk factors (Table). Also, in unadjusted analyses, stratified by sex (p-value for interaction = 0.13), higher CAC volume was associated with increased risk for HF (HR 1.37 [1.03-1.81], p=0.03) and HFpEF (HR 1.76 [0.99-3.16], p=0.06), in males only. No significant associations were observed after adjustments. Conclusion(s): In a multi-ethnic cohort, CAC volume and density were not independently associated with HF, the trend for volume was positive while density was inverse. Low frequency of incident HF in our cohort was an important limitation.},

	title = {Barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access among adolescent latinas in alabama: {When} immigration is a social determinant of health},
	volume = {62},
	abstract = {Purpose: Alabama (AL) experienced a 145\% increase in its Latino pop-ulation between 2000 and 2010; making it the state with the second fastest growing Latino population in the United States (US) during that time. Job opportunities in the agricultural, lumber and poultry industries drew (mostly Mexican and Central-American) immigrant families to AL. Since then, AL has become one of the states with the most severe anti-immigrant policies in the nation. Adolescent Latinas in the US and in AL are disproportionately affected by sexual health disparities compared to their non-Hispanic, white counterparts. However, to our knowledge, no other researchers have examined barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access for this sub-population. The purpose of this study is to examine barriers and facilitators to sexual healthcare access among adolescent Latinas' through in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews (phase 1 of 3-phase study) to develop community driven, theory based, culturally-relevant, multilevel intervention strategies through a community-engaged process. Community based participatory research (CBPR) and the socioecological model of health provided the philosophical and theoretical frameworks, respectively. Method(s): From January to June of 2017, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with adolescents who: self-identified as Latina, were between 15 and 20 years, had been in the US for over five years, and lived in West AL. Participants were recruited through venue-based, purposeful-convenience sampling. Two bilingual (in English and Spanish) coders used an iterative process (between independent coding and consensus building) to analyze the data in NVivo 11. Result(s): Twenty young women participated in the study. Sixty-five percent self-identified as Mexican, 45\% were between 15-16 years of age and 55\% were between 17-19 years of age. Sixty-percent reported that they had health insurance and 35\% reported that they had initiated sexual intercourse in their lifetime. With regard to sexual healthcare access, three main facilitators/barriers emerged: (1) parental approval/disapproval and embarrassment ("pena"); (2) structural facilitators/barriers to care (e.g., lack of transportation, flexible clinic hours); and (3) positive/negative experiences with providers (e.g., perceived discrimination based on immigrant status). When we asked what they would like in a sexual health promotion program, emergent themes included: (1) "parents should be involved in programming"; and (2) "the program should be delivered by young Latinas who understand our experience". Conclusion(s): This work points to the importance of community driven, theory based, culturally-relevant approaches to address the healthcare access needs of under-served immigrant populations in emerging Latino/a communities in states like Alabama, where anti-immigrant sentiment and policies create real and perceived barriers to care. We will discuss our findings in light of the current sociopolitical context both in Alabama and nationally and position our findings within the extant literature which conceptualizes immigration (a global phenomenon) as a social determinant of health.

	volume = {66},
	doi = {10.1136/jim-2017-000663.91},
	abstract = {Purpose of study Racial/ethnic health disparities are preventable differences in health outcomes between different races/ethnicities that are closely linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages. Geography continues to be a predictor of health disparities where infant mortality and chronic health outcomes appear to be intensified in high poverty tract areas in which African Americans and Latinos tend to live, compared to poor non-Hispanic whites. Watts is perpetually constructed as an under-resourced neighbourhood of Los Angeles where residents experience the poorest health. Resources and community health fairs have been identified as effective approaches to reach residents, ensuring health screenings, resource sharing, and gathering data. The primary objective of this study was to provide basic screenings and resources, while assess effectiveness of the fair and gather residents' healthrelated seeking behaviours to identify community-driven strategies to improve overall health. Methods used Using community based participatory research, this study developed and administered a bilingual survey to capture residents' perspectives on the effectiveness of the fair, personal health seeking behaviours, and suggestions to improve health and wellbeing in the community. The surveys were deidentified and coded for frequency analysis of responses using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Summary of results Of the 200 attendees, 107 completed the survey: 71 Latinos, 28 African Americans, 73 Females, 26 Males, 31 between the ages of 36-45, and 51 with a household income under \$15 000. Respondents determined their primary reason for attending was health screenings and identified transportation as a barrier to making their doctor's appointment. The park and library were resources accessed the most, and community-driven recommendations included nutritional education and more health fairs. Conclusions Resources and health fairs in low-income communities serve as immediate approaches for low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. However, health fairs are not able to follow-up with most participants and may be inconsistent. Therefore, large-scale interventions should address limitations to ensure wellbeing in these areas.},

	doi = {10.1111/opn.12179},
	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore multilevel factors affecting older Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviours. BACKGROUND: Although studies have documented significant issues related to healthcare access and utilisation issues among older immigrants, a noted limitation of current research is its failure to explore multiple factors related to their health-seeking behaviours. DESIGN: A qualitative study using interview data from two previous studies. METHOD(S): We performed a qualitative analysis of focus groups and individual interviews using inductive coding methods. The socioecological model provided a useful framework to guide this study. The sample included 17 community-dwelling older Korean immigrants aged {\textgreater}=65 years living in the metropolitan area of Seattle, WA, USA. RESULT(S): Findings revealed various factors at the individual (e.g., perception of health and illness, mistrust, cultural values and norms, length of residency in the United States, language barriers and ageing experiences), interpersonal (e.g., peers, family and primary care physicians), community (e.g., ethnic community centres and organisations, home care helpers and interpretation services) and policy (e.g., lack of affordability and health benefits coverage) levels. Each of these factors played a role as either a barrier to or facilitator of older Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviours. Several factors, such as language barriers and lack of available information, were intertwined. CONCLUSION(S): Findings indicate the importance of considering four major areas when designing culturally appropriate, community-based interventions for older immigrants. Also, utilising peers or trusted human resources in the community is critical to the design and implementation of health promotion interventions for older immigrants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Examining intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and policy level factors that affect older immigrants' health-seeking behaviours informs the design of community-based health promotion interventions for older immigrants.Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	volume = {28},
	doi = {10.1093/eurpub/ckx210},
	abstract = {Background: In order to provide effective primary care for refugees and to develop interventions tailored to them, we must know their needs. Little is known of the health needs and experiences of recently arrived refugees and other migrants throughout their journey through Europe. We aimed to gain insight into their health needs, barriers in access and wishes regarding primary health care. Method(s): In the spring of 2016, we conducted a qualitative, comparative case study in seven EU countries in a centre of first arrival, two transit centres, two intermediate-stay centres and two longer-stay centres using a Participatory Learning and Action research methodology. A total of 98 refugees and 25 healthcare workers participated in 43 sessions. Transcripts and sessions reports were coded and thematically analyzed by local researchers using the same format at all sites; data were synthesized and further analyzed by two other researchers independently. Result(s): The main health problems of the participants related to war and to their harsh journey like common infections and psychological distress. They encountered important barriers in accessing healthcare: time pressure, linguistic and cultural differences and lack of continuity of care. They wish for compassionate, culturally sensitive healthcare workers and for more information on procedures and health promotion. Conclusion(s): Health of refugees on the move in Europe is jeopardized by their bad living circumstances and barriers in access to healthcare. To address their needs, healthcare workers have to be trained in providing integrated, compassionate and cultural competent healthcare.Copyright Â© The Author 2017.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The sickest Australians are often those belonging to non-privileged groups, including Indigenous Australians, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, intersex and queer people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and people with disabilities and low English literacy. These consumers are not always engaged by, or included within, mainstream health services, particularly in rural Australia where health services are limited in number and tend to be generalist in nature., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a new approach for improving the sociocultural inclusivity of mainstream, generalist, rural, health care organisations., DESIGN: This approach combines a modified Continuous Quality Improvement framework with Participatory Action Research principles and Foucault's concepts of power, discourse and resistance to develop a change process that deconstructs the power relations that currently exclude marginalised rural health consumers from mainstream health services. It sets up processes for continuous learning and consumer responsiveness., RESULTS: The approach proposed could provide a Continuous Quality Improvement process for creating more inclusive mainstream health institutions and fostering better engagement with many marginalised groups in rural communities to improve their access to health care., CONCLUSION: The approach to improving cultural inclusion in mainstream rural health services presented in this article builds on existing initiatives. This approach focuses on engaging on-the-ground staff in the need for change and preparing the service for genuine community consultation and responsive change.

OBJECTIVE(S): To (1) further develop the Cambodian American community's capacity to design and conduct health research meaningful to their community via a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, (2) train and deploy bilingual community health workers (CHWs) to gather health-related data from their communities using mobile technology, and (3) measure the feasibility and effectiveness of our efforts. METHOD(S): A CBPR approach was used to engage leaders of Cambodian American communities in six states to identify their research needs, develop a short community health survey administered by CHWs, and conduct the survey using iPads programmed in Khmer spoken-language format. Administrative logs and surveys of CHWs and leaders measured feasibility and effectiveness of the project. RESULT(S): CHWs, leaders, and community members reported largely positive experiences with the community health survey, despite poor/inconsistent Internet connectivity. The institutional capacity of Cambodian American community-based organizations to collect health-related data in their own communities was strengthened. Our efforts proved to be both feasible and effective. CONCLUSION(S): The use of mobile technology with spoken format can be a valuable tool in accessing input from vulnerable community members, including persons who may not be literate in any language. Trained CHWs, backed by dedicated and experienced community leaders, are an asset to their communities.

	abstract = {Research shows that vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most effective methods for reducing risk for cervical cancer; it also protects against other HPV-related cancers. Controversies exist regarding HPV vaccination in several communities; which may in part explain why although rates of HPV vaccination are increasing nationwide, Los Angeles County (LAC) data show that many adolescents are still not vaccinated. These adolescents remain at high-risk for infection. Using community-based participatory principles, we conducted an environmental scan that included a literature review, the development of a community advisory board, community feedback from HPV community meetings, and interviews with stakeholders to understand attitudes toward HPV vaccination and their impact in follow through with HPV vaccines. Twenty-eight key stakeholders participated in our coalition comprised of community organizations and clinics with strong ties to the local community. This is the only coalition dedicated exclusively to improving HPV vaccine uptake in LAC. Of these, twenty-one participated in an environmental scan via qualitative interviews about HPV vaccination programs, service delivery priorities, and proposed steps to increase HPV vaccination uptake in LAC. The environmental scan revealed targets for future efforts, barriers to HPV uptake, and next steps for improving local HPV vaccination uptake rates. The environmental scan also identified local HPV vaccination interventions and resources. Although LAC has developed important efforts for vaccination, some interventions are no longer being implemented due to lack of funds; others have not been evaluated with sufficient outcome data. The risk for cervical and other HPV-related cancers could be greatly reduced in LAC if a multilevel, multicultural, and multilingual approach is taken to better understand rates of HPV vaccination uptake, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities and LGBTQ youth. Our environmental scan provides guidance on attitudes toward vaccination, and how best to address the needs of LAC families and providers.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Background: In the background of a rising burden of dementia globally, the Tata Longitudinal study of Cognitive aging was initiated in to identify risk and protective factors for dementia relevant to a developing country like India. Method(s): A study protocol was developed that reliably captures cognitive status, a range of lifestyle factors, and multimodality biomarkers for dementia, specific to the Indian context. Subsequently, a community cohort of elderly individuals in the South Indian city of Hyderabad and adjoining areas was created who were comprehensively studied for clinical and cognitive status, laboratory investigations, brain imaging according to ADNI II protocol, and Apo E genotype. Result(s): Of the first 104 participants recruited, age range was 50-87 years, 43\% were women, rate of illiteracy was 22\%, 15\% belonged to lower socioeconomic status, 29\% were engaged in unskilled elementary occupations and 13\% were from rural backgrounds, a profile representative of the diversity in local demographics. More than half had cardiovascular risk factors, 66.5\% of individuals had white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI and 7.5\% had silent brain infarcts. We explored the factors that were most likely to be associated with cognitive functioning: literacy, years of education, bilingualism, urban dwelling, skilled and professional occupations, physical activity in late life, lifetime experiences and social networking correlated positively with cognitive status. On Univariate General Linear Model years of education and physical exercise in late life were independently associated with higher cognitive scores. Conclusion(s): This first longitudinal community-based study of cognitive decline from India will provide an opportunity to investigate cognitive resilience against dementia, specific to the Indian context.},

	doi = {10.1055/s-0037-1598145},
	abstract = {Introduction: Reproductive health (RH) disparities have been described between migrants and the Swiss population. The study COMIRES (COmmunity MIgrant RESearch) aims to understand barriers to RH services for migrant women and the role of the community using a community-participatory approach. Method(s): Between July 2014 and June 2015, 13 focus groups were conducted in 7 different languages in 6 migrant communities in Geneva. A semi-structured interview guide explored women's experience and transcripts translated to French were thematically coded using ATLAS.ti. Most of the 78 participants from 21 countries, aged in between 18 - 66 years, were married, had children and lived in Switzerland since 3 months up to 24 years. Result(s): Three major themes explaining barriers were identified: 1.access to RH services (e.g. lack of interpreters, absence of information) 2.socio-economic barriers (e.g. costs, legal status) 3.negative emotional feelings (taboo of the female body, feeling of stigmatisation). Conclusion(s): Despite Switzerland's high-quality RH-care, migrant women require additional assistance to access services. Besides the improvement of health literacy, the development of a culturally sensitive health environment and the availability of interpreters are essential to reduce barriers. The community-based approach helps not only to understand barriers, it also improves trust of the participants towards the university hospital and suggests solutions for better access to RH services. In a follow-up, a mixed-method study explored maternity experiences of 420 women during pregnancy in Geneva and Zurich using a structured questionnaire. As data collection were finalised only end of October 2016, preliminary data might be presented in March 2017.},

	title = {Neural basis of cognitive reserve in dementia: {Role} of bilingualism},
	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Background: With the rising burden of dementia globally, there is a need to identify strategies to prevent dementia or delay its onset. Recent studies report the protective role of life-course experiential factors such as education, occupation and physical exercise. Recently bilingualism has emerged as potential protective factor. How these factors protect against dementia continues to be a matter of debate. In this study, we aimed to study the neural basis for a protective role for bilingualism against cognitive decline, using a multimodality approach. Method(s): 85 subjects with a range of cognitive status from normal cognition (n=32), to Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia (n=53) participated. Subjects were recruited from an ongoing community based longitudinal study of cognitive decline in India. The cohort consisted of subjects of varying educational levels - from illiterate to highly literate and subjects with varying levels of language use, from monolingual to high levels of bilingualism. All subjects underwent detailed evaluation that included cognitive testing on a range of tasks, demographic evaluation, educational, occupation and language profiles. Fractional anisotropy measures derived from high-resolution diffusion- tensor imaging (DTI) on a 3 Tesla MRI was used as an indicator of white matter integrity. Result(s): Our study showed that in participants with normal cognition, being bilingual conferred an advantage in cognitive tasks that were indictors of conflict resolution in attentional/executive demands and visuospatial functions. On regression analysis, accounting for education, age and gender, lower FA values were noted in corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in bilingual compared to monolingual patients with cognitive impairment, for the same severity of impairment. Cognitively normal bilinguals had higher FA values in similar white matter areas compared to their monolingual counterparts. Conclusion(s): Reduced white matter integrity in bilinguals with cognitive impairment compared to monolinguals with similar level of impairment, and higher fiber tract integrity in cognitive normal bilinguals is consistent with the hypothesis that the bilingualism plays a role in enhancing cognitive reserve. The underlying neural mechanism is likely to be related to integrity in tracts that have a role in inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric connectivity, semantic processing and executive control.},

We partnered with the Ethno-Cultural Council of Calgary (ECCC), a community-based organization employing a 'connector model,' to recruit key trusted individuals with extensive reach within their communities who understand the barriers to healthcare access and engagement. ECCC provides "Community Connectors" with specialized training to effectively engage communities and liaise with service providers/ institutions. Drawing from participatory action research methods, six Connectors with an interest in PCOR were identified from Chinese, South Asian, Filipino, Latino-Hispanic, East-African, and Syrian communities. Connectors received training in PCOR for this study over six months. Result(s): In collaborating with Community Connectors, we were able to obtain diverse perspectives needed for the study. Six focus groups with 46 participants were conducted. Connectors employed various approaches to successfully engage each community, including: recruiting participants through their own networks e.g. use of social and ethnic media; conducting focus groups in different languages; and use of community settings during evenings/weekends to ensure access, availability, and comfort. Focus group participants and communities maintained active participation in validating research findings and guiding the development of knowledge translation products. Through this study, we ensured ongoing partnership with ECCC and together built research capacity in PCOR among the Connectors, in the aim of continuing sustained and meaningful engagement with diverse communities through our PCOR. Conclusion(s): Partnering with a community-based organization and exploring novel approaches to engaging ethno-cultural communities allowed us to obtain diverse perspectives needed for our PCOR. Incorporating patient voices requires addressing issues related to equity and understanding the barriers to effective and meaningful engagement that is representative of society's diverse make-up.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Introduction: In addition to the ageing of the population, the United States faces a significant sociodemographic challenge: The growth in the number of minorities. Minorities and older adults are particularly vulnerable to receiving suboptimal healthcare. Method(s): In collaboration with community organizations and a Federal government grant through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Geriatric Resource Interprofessional Program (GRIP) was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). It spearheaded an educational initiative on cognitive dysfunction targeting minority communities in Queens County. Four sessions were conducted at community centers. An additional session was conducted to address the needs of caregivers of older adults with dementias. Consecutive interpretation of the lectures was performed to the predominant language of the group. Two sessions discussing the assessment and management of cognitive syndromes in older cancer patients were delivered to clinical staff at regional locations of MSKCC. Result(s): A total of 171 people who spoke 15 different primary languages attended the community sessions. Their median age was 66 (28-99 years) and 65\% were women. 53\% were born in Bangladesh, the rest in 16 other countries. 34 providers-nurses, case managers, social workers and oncologists attended the two clinical sessions. Their median age was 57.5 (31-73 years). 90\% were female (N=31) and 82\% identified as white (N=28). Conclusion(s): Challenges to the initiative included differences in literacy, multiple cultures and languages. Successes and barriers faced in implementing the educational initiative, as well as pre and post-test results will be presented.},

	volume = {32},
	doi = {10.1111/jgh.13892},
	abstract = {Background: In Australia, the burden of chronic hepatitis B is not evenly distributed. A priority population is people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds who encounter several barriers, including stigma, discrimination, language difficulties, and diminished access to health care. More than half of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection are unaware of their status and may not access health care; and, when they do, it is overshadowed by other priorities. Point-of-care (POC) testing, when used in combination with increased awareness programs, may overcome some of these barriers. Aim(s): The aim of this pilot study is to assess the role and effectiveness of hepatitis B POC testing in the CALD community setting, to heighten awareness and facilitate education and dialogue about hepatitis B. By using POC testing as a means to engage with these communities, we hope to destigmatize and overcome barriers to accessing health care, while providing a simple and valuable service for those who may never have a chance of being screened. Method(s): Community events with individuals from CALD backgrounds were targeted between May 2015 and August 2016. Attendees were provided with culturally appropriate educational resources and offered the finger-prick Point of Care HBsAg Rapid test (Standard Diagnostics). Results were available within 30 minutes. Post-test counselling and followup were provided for those with positive or negative results, presenting a further engagement opportunity. Result(s): A total of eight community events involving individuals from CALD backgrounds were included. Of the 679 individuals approached, 259 (38.1\%) were screened for hepatitis B infection using the POC test. Of the 259 individuals screened, six (2.3\%) were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, and 62 results (23.9\%) were invalid. Reasons for not pursuing screening included known hepatitis B status, fear of knowing hepatitis B status, or fear of needle-stick injuries. These individuals were still provided with information and educated about vaccination, testing, and treatment options. Conclusion(s): Over 250 POC tests were performed on individuals who were not aware of their hepatitis B status in at-risk communities. This provided opportunities for direct engagement, education, and discussion about hepatitis B. Furthermore, patients were encouraged to discuss this with family members and contacts. By being visible and present at community events, we endeavor to destigmatize hepatitis B POC testing in CALD communities through engagement and education, while providing testing for hepatitis B with immediate results, thereby overcoming the barriers commonly encountered by this population.},

	title = {Impact of a pilot community-based clinical pharmacist hypertension program on patient activation among {Chinese} {American} seniors},
	volume = {32},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older Chinese Americans have a disproportionately higher rate of undertreated hypertension (HTN) compared to non-Latino Whites, and Asian Americans report weaker patient-provider engagement than desired. As patient activation can be a powerful driver of improved HTN control, we assessed the efficacy of a culturally tailored clinical pharmacist intervention on patient activation among immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. METHOD(S): We conducted a pre-post, prospective intervention with repeated measures in Los Angeles County. We screened and recruited patients from 8 community health centers and private practice clinics between 2015-2016. Eligible patients (age 60+, medically insured, past year visit at study clinic, at least 2 of 3 systolic blood pressure [BP] readings above JNC-8 goal in past year) were invited to a study information session through mailings and telephone calls in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Enrolled participants had 3 visits within 3 months with bilingual study pharmacists, who were trained to elicit HTN explanatory models when providing HTN education and use motivational interviewing (MI) and shared decision-making (SDM) when counseling patients on lifestyle changes and BP medications. Study participants' physicians received a brief summary of each visit and signed pharmacist recommendations for medications or lab orders if in agreement. Participants completed baseline and final surveys before their first and after their last pharmacist visit, including demographic information and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). We also conducted chart reviews to obtain clinical information. We estimated a sample size of 50 patients would detect a clinically significant 3 to 5-point difference in our primary outcome, PAM scores, with 80\% power. We tested for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULT(S): We screened 415 potential participants to enroll 50 immigrant Chinese American seniors who received the intervention. The average age was 71 years, and 23 (47\%) were female. Participants had resided in the U.S. for an average of 30 years, but only 10 (20\%) were comfortable speaking English. Median baseline level of trust in pharmacists was "somewhat" to "strongly trust". The mean baseline PAM score was 58.8 signifying "beginning to take action," with a mean change of -2.04 +/- 13.9 (p = 0.48) at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): While clinical pharmacist HTN interventions have shown success in some settings, our intervention utilizing MI and SDMstrategies was not associated with increases in PAM scores for immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. Despite strong project involvement of community partners in these predominantly Asian neighborhoods, eligible seniors frequently declined to enroll. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to identify other team-based care approaches which may be more appealing and successful at increasing patient activation for HTN control in this population.},

Second, qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 Latino parents from a rural community to better understand attitudes toward CBT, and modes of service delivery. Qualitative findings revealed that parents were mostly positive about psychotherapy, and the core elements of CBT for anxiety. However, both parents and providers emphasized the need for adaptations to address practical and perceived barriers to treatment, such as time, convenience, homework, and literacy. Many parents spoke favorably of a telephone-based approach that could address many of their perceived barriers, while providers were expressed more negative views.

In response, health care organizations are developing and implementing cultural competency curricula. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, we developed and evaluated a cultural competency training program to improve the delivery of culturally appropriate care in Marshallese and Hispanic communities., METHODS: We used a mixed-methods evaluation approach based on the Kirkpatrick model of training evaluation. We collected quantitative evaluation data immediately after each training session (March 19, 2015-November 30, 2016) and qualitative data about implementation at 2 points: immediately after each session and 6 months after training. Individuals and organizational units provided qualitative data., RESULTS: We delivered 1,250 units of in-person training at 25 organizations. Participants reported high levels of changes in knowledge (91.2\%), competence (86.6\%), and performance (87.2\%) as a result of the cultural competency training. Organizations reported making policy and environmental changes., CONCLUSION: Initial outcomes demonstrate the value of developing and implementing cultural competency training programs using a CBPR approach. Additional research is needed to determine the effect on long-term patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Childhood obesity is rising among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) groups who show poor engagement in obesity prevention initiatives. We examined the barriers and facilitators to the engagement of CALD communities in obesity prevention initiatives., METHODS: We used the nominal group technique to collect data from 39 participants from Vietnamese, Burmese, African, Afghani and Indian origins living in disadvantaged areas of Victoria, Australia. Data analysis revealed ranked priorities for barriers and facilitators for CALD community engagement in obesity prevention initiatives., RESULTS: CALD parents identified key barriers as being: competing priorities in the post-migration settlement phase; language, cultural and program accessibility barriers; low levels of food and health literacy; junk food advertisement targeting children; and lack of mandatory weight checks for schoolchildren. Key facilitators emerged as: bicultural playgroup leaders; ethnic community groups; and school-based healthy lunch box initiatives., CONCLUSION: This study has identified several policy recommendations including: the implementation of robust food taxation policies; consistent control of food advertising targeting children; improving CALD health literacy using bicultural workers; and matching health promotional materials with CALD community literacy levels. Implications for Public Health: These recommendations can directly influence public health policy to improve the engagement of CALD communities in obesity prevention services and ultimately reduce the widening obesity disparities in Australia.Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors.},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {Purpose: High rates of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) exist in foreign- born (FB) persons who are often not diagnosed. We implemented a HBV screening and care linkage program targeting Asian communities in New Jersey from 2014-16. Method(s): We conducted this program as a primary care practice based out of a community hospital and collaborated with local ethnic community and faith-based organizations. Screening occurred at an Asian-targeted primary care site, outreach events, and via a coupon for free testing at outpatient labs. Persons were tested for HBsAg, HBcAb and HBsAb. A patient navigator assisted with linking hepatitis B-infected persons to care. Result(s): Of 692 persons tested, 80\% were Asian. Median age was 55, and 64\% were female. Fifty-nine percent were screened through outreach events, 30\% through primary care, and 11\% through coupons. Five percent (36) were HBsAg positive, and country-of-origin stratification showed highest rates in China (11.1\%) and Taiwan (7.7\%). One-third of participants were HBV-susceptible, and vaccines were recommended. Fifty-six percent were immune, and immunity was due to previous exposure in 33\% of FB versus 10\% in US born (p{\textless}.001). Fourteen percent reported having no insurance. Of the insured, 69\% reported having a primary care physician, and 36\% of these reported having prior HBV testing. In the risk factor survey, 31\% reported acupuncture, 34\% body piercing, 32\% medical procedure abroad, and 10\% household member with CHB. Of Asians, 19\% reported a family member with CHB. HBV knowledge survey revealed many gaps; only 52\% were aware that HBV causes cancer and more than 20\% believed that HBV is transmitted through food or sharing food. Among 36 patients with CHB, 86\% were linked-to-care to the practice. Ninety-one percent received HBV care, an evaluation by an internist trained in HBV management. HBV testing included HBV DNA (97\%), liver function tests (97\%), and HBeAg/HBeAb (93\%). Nineteen percent required antiviral treatment. Household contact testing was advised for all, and 50\% (18) had a family member return, with 5 of those receiving vaccine. Insurance enrollment efforts reduced the number uninsured CHB patients from 13 to 3. Four patients obtained care in Taiwan or China. Conclusion(s): Collaborations of providers and community organi zations can be effective at screening hard-to-reach foreign-born populations who face lack of insurance, gaps in knowledge, and lack of PCP screening. We found high rates of previous HBV exposure in FB persons and counselled on potential HBV reactivation. Navigation services based out of a primary care office were successful at achieving high rates of follow-up and HBV-directed care.},

	abstract = {Objective: To develop an expandable knowledge base of reusable knowledge related to self-management of diabetes that can be used as a foundation for patient-centric decision support tools. Material(s) and Method(s): The structure and components of the knowledge base were created in participatory design with academic diabetes educators using knowledge acquisition methods. The knowledge base was validated using scenario-based approach with practicing diabetes educators and individuals with diabetes recruited from Community Health Centers (CHCs) serving economically disadvantaged communities and ethnic minorities in New York. Result(s): The knowledge base includes eight glycemic control problems, over 150 behaviors known to contribute to these problems coupled with contextual explanations, and over 200 specific action-oriented self-management goals for correcting problematic behaviors, with corresponding motivational messages. The validation of the knowledge base suggested high level of completeness and accuracy, and identified improvements in cultural appropriateness. These were addressed in new iterations of the knowledge base. Discussion(s): The resulting knowledge base is theoretically grounded, incorporates practical and evidence-based knowledge used by diabetes educators in practice settings, and allows for personally meaningful choices by individuals with diabetes. Participatory design approach helped researchers to capture implicit knowledge of practicing diabetes educators and make it explicit and reusable. Conclusion(s): The knowledge base proposed here is an important step towards development of new generation patient-centric decision support tools for facilitating chronic disease self-management. While this knowledge base specifically targets diabetes, its overall structure and composition can be generalized to other chronic conditions.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

Design Co-creation and participatory action research, based on reflection, data collection, interaction and feedback from participants and stakeholders. Setting An SDN support model embedded within a home nursing service in Melbourne, Australia was implemented between October 2013 and October 2015. Participants People experiencing memory loss or with a diagnosis of dementia from CALD backgrounds and their carers and family living in the community setting and expert stakeholders. Data collection and analysis Reflections from the SDN on interactions with participants and expert stakeholder opinion informed the CALD dementia support model and pathway. Results Interaction with 62 people living with memory loss or dementia from CALD backgrounds, carers or family members receiving support from the SDN and feedback from 13 expert stakeholders from community aged-care services, consumer advocacy organisations and ethnic community group representatives informed the development and refinement of the CALD dementia model of care and pathway. We delineate the three components of the 'SDN' model: the organisational support; a description of the role; and the competencies needed. Additionally, we provide an accompanying pathway for use by health professionals delivering care to consumers with dementia from CALD backgrounds. Conclusions Our culturally sensitive model of dementia care and accompanying pathway allows for the tailoring of health and social support to assist people from CALD backgrounds, their carers and families to adjust to living with memory loss and remain living in the community as long as possible. The model and accompanying pathway also have the potential to be rolled out nationally for use by health professionals across a variety of health services.},

Although congregations may provide reach into these communities, the extent to which church-based HIV testing alleviates access barriers, identifies new cases, and reaches people at increased risk for HIV is not well documented. We examined the results of an HIV testing program that was conducted as part of a larger intervention aimed at reducing HIV stigma at five churches in Los Angeles County, California, in 2011-2012. HIV screening identified one positive result in 323 tests but reached a substantial proportion of people who had not been tested before, including many who lacked health insurance. Although this approach may not be an efficient way to identify cases of previously unknown HIV infection, it could help achieve universal testing goals.Copyright Â© 2016, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

	abstract = {Lifestyle and dietary habits are crucial features that can alter the gut microbiome of humans. Humans, along with their gut microbes, have coevolved in order to sustain themselves in different environments. They were able to adapt themselves to the dietary sources available in their environment. The relation between humans and their gut microbiota and the link with coevolution forms an interesting aspect of research. To understand this association, the participation of ancient communities with less exposure to urbanization is a prerequisite. The current study quantifies the richness of bacterial groups in the gut of Nicobarese. This group of population is an ethnic community of Nicobar group of islands, who have migrated from the remote to rural and urban areas. Alterations in the dominant bacterial groups in relation to their lifestyle transition were emphasized, by comparing the participants from remote, rural and urban settings. The remote cohort remains diverse and stable than the other two cohorts and had higher numbers of Bacteroidetes. Prevotella forms the dominant genus in the Bacteroidetes phylum, indicating the carbohydrate-rich diet of remote Nicobarese. Whereas, the urban cohort is dominated by Bifidobacterium group rather than the Bacteroidetes. Implications of dietary patterns, the transition to different lifestyles and their impact on the microbiota among these cohorts are discussed.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Equality of care in pregnancy is important for all women, however can be difficult for healthcare providers to achieve. It has been found that culturally and linguistically diverse women born overseas generally have lower satisfaction with pregnancy care than women born in the host country. Aim(s): Using a phenomenological framework, and models of care as a conceptual framework, this study explored the perceptions of care experienced by refugees and migrant women of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who had participated in a community-based antenatal programme specialising in maternity care of multicultural women. Method(s): Informants were twelve women aged between 23 and 44 years of age; one woman was 33 weeks pregnant, other women had given birth in the six months prior to data collection. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, using interpreters for women who spoke little or no English. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Finding(s): Four main themes were identified; Social Support, Gaining of Knowledge, A Holistic Service, and New Opportunities. Conclusion(s): Using a community-based antenatal service specialising in maternity care of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds enabled the needs of refugee and migrant women to be recognised and met, and therefore enhanced their perception of the pregnancy experience.Copyright Â© 2015 Australian College of Midwives..},

Rates of major depression are significantly high among low-income predominantly Hispanic/Latino with chronic illness, such as diabetes and heart disease. The study design of the A Helping Hand to Activate Patient-Centered Depression Care among Low-income Patients (AHH) randomized clinical trial aims to enhance patient depression care receipt and overall bio-psychosocial self-care management. The AHH trial is conducted in collaboration with three Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) safety net clinics that provide Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) care. The study compares AHH intervention (AHH) in which community-based bilingual promotoras provide in-person or telephone patient engagement and intervention aimed to reduce the burden and strain on patients, families, and care providers by assessing, enhancing, and facilitating patient depression and co-morbid illness self-care management skill, and activating patient communication with clinic medical providers versus DHS PCMH team usual care (PCMHUC). AHH independent bilingual recruiters screened 1957 and enrolled 348 predominantly Hispanic/Latino patients, of whom 296 (85\%) had diabetes, 14 (4\%) with heart disease, and 38 (11\%) with both diseases. Recruiters identified depressed patients by baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 10 or more, completed baseline assessments, and randomized patients to either AHH or PCMHUC study group. The comprehensive assessments will be repeated at 6 and 12 months by an independent bilingual follow-up interviewer.

	abstract = {Background A community-university partnership was developedto address lupus disparities in the Hispanic/Latino Chicagolandcommunity. Lupus significantly impacts Latinos due to lack ofearly detection, diagnosis, and care. A curriculum was created toeducate Popular Opinion Leaders (POLs) as leaders who thenprovide lupus education to the community. POLs were trained inthree local communities; the POL groups consisted of 1) HighSchool Students, 2) Community Health Workers, and 3) ParentLeaders. Our goal was to pilot test this education program acrossdifferent age groups and literacy levels as a prelude to field workincreasing lupus awareness in the targeted communities.Materials and methods To measure knowledge acquisition ofthe newly trained POLs, pre-and post-test questionnaires wereadministered over four sessions. Questionnaires were designedwith a health literacy expert for content, clarity and literacy level.As part of the assessment, we also analysed the following demographic and acculturation variables: birthplace (Mexico/U.S./Other); \# of years in the US; strong sense of belonging to an ethnic group (4-point scale) and the following lupus knowledge variables: lupus is a chronic disease (Yes/No/don't know); there is acure for lupus (Yes/No/don't know); and which symptom is not alupus symptom (choose from a list). Demographic and acculturation characteristics and knowledge responses pre-and post-testresponses were summarised by community using descriptivestatistics.Results We trained community health workers from Erie Neighbourhood House (n = 14), high school students from Cicero(n = 14) and parent leaders from Burbank (n = 28). Participantcharacteristics and knowledge gain are shown in Table 1.Conclusions Overall, there was evidence to support lupusknowledge improvement after the completion of POL educational sessions. We encountered some difficulties in performingthis evaluation due language difficulty not only limited to literacylevel but also in interpretation of questions and bilingual interpreters were needed to assist POL assessments.

	abstract = {Purpose: While there is an abundance of research on the after effects of the 3.11 triple disaster on subsets of affected individuals, including nuclear power plant workers, there is a dearth of literature examining the experiences of those who remain internally displaced by the disaster. This project was designed to create a visual and oral narrative of the daily lives of internally displaced individuals in Fukushima, Japan. Method(s): Using Photovoice, a community based participatory research method that uses documentary photography and storytelling, seven residents of the Onodai temporary housing shelter underwent three rounds of photo-taking during July, 2015. Each round of photos was followed by individual in-depth interviews, and group discussions. Bilingual medical students acted as translators during the interview process. The English portions of each interview was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using grounded theory to identify broad categories that were then refined to generate consistent themes. Outcome \& Evaluation: The resident's stories, elicited by the photographs they took, showed how the long-term effects of the disaster manifested as a series of juxtapositions in their lives. Several participants reported feeling torn between their loss of purpose, as their farmland was destroyed, and their enjoyment of new-found leisure time. They also reported that while they enjoyed the sense of community that they had within the temporary housing shelter, they often felt stifled by the new level of physical proximity to their neighbors. Finally, they reported feeling that nature, with which they reported having close communion, had been tarnished by the radiation that now covered their homes, forests, and fields. All participants, however, reported a desire to build a better life, either by building new homes in areas that had not been affected by the radiation, or by rebuilding their lives and legacies in their hometown. Going Forward: This small study may give some insight into the feelings of internally displaced Japanese people in the wake of this disaster, and may hopefully inform the efforts of those who are attempting to aid in this recovery.},

	volume = {64},
	doi = {10.1136/jim-d-15-00013.83},
	abstract = {Purpose of Study This project aims to provide a multilingual intimate partner violence (IPV) screening tool and a list of local, multilingual IPV counseling and shelter services for the API community of Seattle. Methods Used A literature review found a few key points. First, studies have shown that IPV programs such as hotlines and shelters are effective in reducing survivors' fear, increasing self-efficacy, coping skills and helping survivors feel more supported. Second, screening can improve quality of life for IPV survivors. Third, subjective screening questions like, "Do you feel safe at home?" are not sensitive, and survivors prefer self-administered or written methods rather than face to face questioning. The STaT screening tool was chosen for its 3 objective questions and up to 94.9\% sensitivity. The card format was discussed with community partner API Chaya. The project was proposed to a behavioral health specialist, community health advocates, the Health Education Supervisor and Health Advocacy Manager at the International Community Health Services (ICHS) clinic in Seattle's International District. Summary of Results A two-part card was created with the STaT screening tool on the top card and a list of three multilingual, local IPV resources on the bottom card. The top can be torn off and disposed of after use, which, with the business card size, makes it discreet and less likely to be found by an abuser. The card will be translated to API languages and distributed at the ICHS clinic and by ICHS community health advocates when they host health fairs, dance classes, visit with community members etc. A document about how to use the card was also given to the clinic. Conclusions Collaboration between a community health clinic and a local IPV resource organization along with evidence based implementation strengthens the impact of this project. It provides IPV survivors with a screening tool that can be self-administered, and with acces to local, multilingual counseling and shelter services. The card will now be translated by the clinic, distributed in the International District of Seattle, and may soon be used by other ICHS clinics in different neighborhoods. This card is mainly targeted towards women because unfortunately there is a lack of research about and resources for IPV survivors who are men.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Vietnam, a multi-ethnic country, is one of the low-middle income countries where epidemiological information on thalassemia remains insufficient. In this study, we determined the burden of thalassemia among ethnic minorities with microcytosis. Method(s): A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a community of ethnic minority in Thai Nguyen province, northern Vietnam. A total of 308 minorities participated, and all of them are Tay ethnicity. Blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA were collected and determined for complete blood count using an automated hematology analyzer. Individuals with microcytosis, as indicated by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of less than 80 femtolitre (fl), were investigated further for thalassemia using an automated capillary zone electrophoresis. DNA was extracted and send to Thailand for identification of alpha-(0)-thalassemia using a gap-polymerase chain reaction (gap-PCR). Result(s): Microcytosis was found in 82 out of 308 participants (26.6\%). Of these, 35 (42.7\%) were found to be alpha-(0)-thalassemia traits. Using Hb A2 {\textgreater} 4.0\% as cutoff value, beta-thalassemia heterozygote was diagnosed in 20 participants (24.4\%). Hemoglobin H disease was identified in 6 cases (7.3\%). Three hemoglobin E (Hb E) traits (3.7\%) and 3 cases with double heterozygous state for alpha-(0)-thalassemia and beta-thalassemia (3.7\%) were also found. The remaining 15 cases (18.3\%) require further investigation. Conclusion(s): The findings reflect a serious burden of severe thalassemia syndromes within the study population and underline an urgent need for the establishment of laboratory facilities for thalassemia diagnosis in order to implement appropriate prevention program in the country.},

	abstract = {Background: Access and adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines is challenging for women with language, cultural, and financial barriers. We partnered with several community sites in the City of Milwaukee, the mobile mammography coach, and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program (WWWP). We organized monthly, small group workshops with the help of a multi-lingual navigator, community health workers, and translators. The 12-month program provided delivery of mammograms through the mobile coach, free to eligible women {\textgreater} 45 years. Method(s): We administered survey evaluations, demographic surveys, and pre- and post-tests of breast cancer knowledge. Descriptive statistics, test for proportions and McNemar's test were used to summarize and analyze the results. Qualitative answers reflecting barriers are also summarized. Result(s): 195 women of several ethnicities (mean age 44) attended the workshops: 49\% were {\textgreater}= 45 years old and 45\% insured. Among the insured, a higher proportion of women reported prior screening mammography, while fewer women had no screening due to multiple barriers. Several women (both insured and uninsured) suffered from language barriers, fear of disease, transportation, and religious beliefs; these were addressed in small group-focused sessions. Under WWWP guidelines, 28 women were eligible for the free mammogram. Surveys of breast health knowledge showed significant improvement from pre- to postworkshop. Conclusion(s): Our community-academic partnership model provided culturallytailored breast health education with the help of multilingual staff members. Adherence to screening mammography is heavily influenced by, but does not entirely depend upon, insurance status and indicates a greater need for culturally competent breast health education for women with multiple barriers.},

The single-session slide presentation with embedded videos, originally developed through a campus-community partnership in Southern California, was chosen for adaptation because it was perceived to fit the CORRECT model of innovation (credible, observable, relevant, relatively advantageous, easy to understand, compatible, and testable) and because of the potential to customize any components not identified as core, allowing them to be revised for cultural and linguistic alignment in New York City. Most of the 143 community participants (76.2\%) were female; most (54.6\%) were older than 59 years. More than half (78.3\%) preferred to speak English or were bilingual in English and Spanish. A large proportion (41.3\%) had not completed high school. Knowledge and perceived benefits and barriers regarding CCT showed small, though statistically significant, increases. There were no statistically significant group differences for changes in mean knowledge, perceived benefits, or perceived barriers when examined by ethnicity, education level, language, or other included sociodemographic variables. However, a small, but statistically significant difference in perceived barriers was observed when examined by country of origin, with the foreign born score worsening 0.08 points (SD = 0.47, p = .007) on the 5-point Likert-type scale administered posteducation compared to preeducation. Participants' open-ended comments demonstrated the acceptability of the topic and intervention. This adaptation resulted in an intervention with the potential to educate African American and Latina/o general community members in a new geographic region about the purpose, methods, and benefits of CCTs.

	abstract = {Issue addressed: Recently arrived migrants and refugees from a culturally and linguistically diverse background (CALD) may be particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. Participation in sport is endorsed as a vehicle to ease the resettlement process; however, in Australia, this is often thought as a simple matter of integration into existing sport structures (e.g. clubs). This approach fails to place actual community needs at the centre of sport engagement efforts. Method(s): A consultation framework was established with South Australian CALD community leaders and organisations to scope needs for community-based alternatives to participation in traditional sport (e.g. clubs), co-design a suitable community sport program and pilot it in five communities. Interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted with participants, community representatives, stakeholders and volunteers. Result(s): Regular, free soccer activities engaged 263 young people from a great variety of nationalities, including over 50\% refugees, in secondary state school and community-based sites. Conclusion(s): Alternative community sport programs can provide a basic but valuable forum to promote physical activity and associated well being in CALD and refugee communities.So what?: Alternative approaches can extend the health benefits of sport participation to disadvantaged children and youth who are excluded from traditional sport participation opportunities.},

Community-based settings are useful for delivering health-related interventions in racial/ethnic minority communities. This article describes strategies used to recruit churches for participation in a 22-month intervention designed to increase physical activity levels in AA women. Initial recruitment efforts, led by AA study staff, included direct mailers, phone calls, and in-person meetings with church representatives. After 10 months, only five churches were enrolled. Seven community members with existing partnerships/contacts in the faith community were subsequently hired and an additional 26 churches were enrolled within 6 months. Overall response rate was 45\%, and churches required 3.5 +/- 3.0 months of multiple contacts prior to enrollment. The main primary contacts within churches were individuals with personal interest in the program and pastors. Prior relationship between the research team and churches did not appear to influence church enrollment as much as community member recruiters. The current study identifies several potential strategies that may be useful for increasing success in efforts to recruit AA churches into studies. Additional research is warranted that tests and compares a variety of recruitment strategies to determine the most successful strategies for recruitment in different populations.

This project developed recommendations to mitigate the public health impact of immigration enforcement policies in North Carolina., METHODS: Our community-based participatory research partnership conducted 6 Spanish-language report-backs (an approach to sharing, validating, and interpreting data) and 3 bilingual forums with community members and public health leaders throughout North Carolina. The goals of these events were to discuss the impact of immigration enforcement on Latino health and develop recommendations to increase health services access and utilization. Findings from the report-backs and forums were analyzed using grounded theory to identify and refine common recommendations., RESULTS: A total of 344 people participated in the report-backs and forums. Eight recommendations emerged: increase knowledge among Latinos about local health services; build capacity to promote policy changes; implement system-level changes among organizations providing health services; train lay health advisors to help community members navigate systems; share Latinos' experiences with policy makers; reduce transportation barriers; increase schools' support of Latino families; and increase collaboration among community members, organizations, health care providers, and academic researchers., LIMITATIONS: Representatives from 16 of 100 North Carolina counties participated. These 16 counties represent geographically diverse regions, and many of these counties have large Latino populations., CONCLUSIONS: Immigration enforcement is a public health issue.

In addition, participants were asked questions about system usability., RESULTS: The mean system usability was 77.57 +/- 17.66 (range, 0-100). The mean completion time for taking the 63 survey questions in the needs assessment was 23.11 +/- 9.62 minutes. The survey completion rate was optimal (100\%), with only 6.34\% missingness per variable. We found no sociodemographic differences in usability scores., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that Android tablets could serve as useful tools in CBPR studies.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Mixtecs and Zapotecs are indigenous populations from Mexico. Many are unable to read and write, and speak only their native nonwritten languages, Mixteco and Zapoteco. About one-half of California's indigenous farm worker population is estimated to be Mixteco-speaking (82,000-125,000), and about 20,000 Mixtecs and a smaller number of Zapotecs live in Ventura County. Objective(s): A community-academic partnership conducted mixed-methods research with the aims of 1) collecting preliminary data on women's health needs, 2) training promotoras to assist with this effort, and 3) engaging community members and obtaining their input through community dialogues. Method(s): Promotoras who were bilingual in Spanish and either Mixteco or Zapoteco were trained to conduct surveys that included questions on breast feeding and receipt of breast and cervical cancer screening examinations. Barriers to and facilitators of women obtaining these cancer screening tests were discussed in small groups. Result(s): In 2013, 813 Mixtec and Zapotec women completed surveys. Although most women reported breast feeding (94\%), and receipt of a pelvic examination (85\%) and a breast examination (72\%), only 44\% of women 40years and older had ever heard of and 33\% had ever had a mammogram. Community members recommended offering free mammograms on the weekend by female providers, having women accompanied by promotoras who can translate, conducting door-to-door outreach, advertising cancer screening on the radio and providing small incentives to women. Discussion(s): Trained bilingual promotoras can assist in increasing the capacity of indigenous communities to conduct collaborative research by engaging community members and collecting local data.Copyright Â© 2015 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.},

Methods The qualitative pilot study guided by the revised Network Episode Model and informed by ethnographic analysis and community-based purposive sampling method were used. Face-to-face audiotaped interviews with eight Khmer mothers were conducted by bilingual female middle-aged community health leaders who spoke Khmer. Results The findings revealed that Khmer mothers clearly lacked knowledge about HBV and HPV infection prevention and had difficulty understanding and educating their daughters about health behavior, especially on sex-related topics. The findings showed that histo-sociocultural factors are integrated with the individual factor, and these factors influenced the HBV and HPV knowledge and perspective of Khmer mothers' parenting. Conclusions The study suggests that situation-specific conceptual and methodological approaches that take into account the uniqueness of the sociocultural context of CAs is a novel method for identifying factors that are significant in shaping the perception of Khmer mothers' health education related to HBV and HPV prevention among their daughters. The communication between mother and daughter about sex and the risk involved in contracting HBV and HPV has been limited, partly because it is seen as a "taboo subject" and partly because mothers think that schools educate their children regarding sexuality and health.Copyright Â© 2015, Korean Society of Nursing Science.},

There is a paucity of research regarding overall level of acculturation for Chinese older adults in the United States. This study aimed to provide an overall estimate of level of acculturation of Chinese older adults in the United States and to examine correlations between sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health measures, and level of acculturation. Data were collected through the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study. This community-based participatory research study surveyed 3,159 Chinese older adults aged 60 and older. The PINE Study Acculturation Scale was used to assess level of acculturation in three dimensions: language preference, media use, and ethnic social relations. Mean acculturation level for all items was 15.3 +/- 5.1, indicating low levels of acculturation. Older age, more offspring, lower income, fewer years living in the United States, lower overall health status, and lower quality of life were associated with lower levels of acculturation. Level of acculturation was low in Chinese older adults, and certain subsets of the population were more likely to have a lower level of acculturation. Future research should investigate causality and effects of level of acculturation.Â© 2015, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation Â© 2015, The American Geriatrics Society.},

	abstract = {Context: Aldosterone and PTH are implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and skeletal diseases. An expanding body of evidence supports a bidirectional and positive physiologic relationship between aldosterone and PTH. Large population-based studies confirming this relationship, and whether it may be targeted as a potential method to mitigate the clinical consequences associated with excess aldosterone and PTH, are needed. Objective(s): We hypothesized that higher aldosterone levels would associate with higher PTH, and that the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors would predict lower PTH in a large, multi-ethnic, community-based cohort. Design, Setting, Participants: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis without apparent primary hyperparathyroidism or chronic kidney disease (n = 5668). We evaluated associations of RAAS inhibitor use with PTH concentration among 1888 treated hypertensive participants. We also tested associations of serum aldosterone concentration with PTH concentration among 1547 participants with these measurements. Outcome(s): Serum PTH concentration. Result(s): Higher aldosterone associated with higher PTH (beta = 0.19 pg/ml per 1 ng/dl of aldosterone, P {\textless} .0001), and this finding was most pronounced among those with a primary hyperaldosteronism-like phenotype. There was a stepwise increment in PTH when comparing untreated normotensives, hypertensives using RAAS inhibitors, untreated hypertensives, and treated hypertensives using non-RAAS inhibitors (40.8,45.0,46.2,47.1 pg/ml, respectively). The use of any RAAS inhibitor independently associated with lower PTH (beta = -2.327 pg/ml per use of RAAS inhibitor, P = .006), when compared with the use of any non-RAAS inhibitor medication. Conclusion(s): Higher serum aldosterone concentration is associated with higher serum PTH concentration, and the use of RAAS inhibitors is associated with lower PTH concentration. These results extend prior evidence from observational and intervention studies suggesting a potentially important and modifiable relationship between the RAAS and PTH in humans.Copyright Â© 2015 by the Endocrine Society.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and identify the predictors of depression among community-dwelling Korean American elderly (KAE). Design(s): A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological survey using a two-step sampling strategy to obtain a representative community sample. Setting(s): The authors recruited study participants at religious, service, and business establishments in the KA community (26 churches, 6 senior centers, 2 medical daycare centers, 1 supermarket). Participant(s): Community-dwelling first-generation KAE (N = 1,118; mean age +/-SD: 70.5 +/-7.0 years; female: 67.2\%). Measurements: Trained bilingual nurses and community health workers interviewed participants face-to-face for demographic information, chronic conditions, and depression using the Korean versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9K). Result(s): 30.3\% of KAEs were classified as having either mild (PHQ-9K score 5e9; N = 218, 19.5\%) or clinical depression (PHQ-9K score {\textgreater}= N =120, 10.8\%), respectively. One of seven KAE (N = 164, 14.7\%) endorsed thoughts of death or self-injury, but only 63 (5.7\%) reported utilizing mental health services. The authors also identified several predictors of depression, including living arrangement (living alone versus living with family/spouse); having chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, digestive disorders, or chronic bronchitis; years of education; and cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): The authors' findings reveal a high prevalence of depression among KAE and a low level of mental health service utilization. Because there are urgent needs for culturally and contextually relevant interventions, the authors also discuss the feasibility of community-based interventions to reduce the burden of depression, which should be incorporated into a management system for multiple chronic conditions.Copyright Â© 2015 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Introduction Korean Americans are one of the most underserved ethnic/linguistic minority groups owing to cultural and institutional barriers; there is an urgent need for culturally competent diabetes management programs in the Korean American community for those with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a community-based, culturally tailored, multimodal behavioral intervention program in an ethnic/linguistic minority group with type 2 diabetes. Design An RCT with waitlist comparison based on the Predisposing, Reinforcing, and Enabling Constructs in Education/environmental Diagnosis and Evaluation (PRECEDE)-Policy, Regulatory, and Organizational Constructs in Educational and Environmental Development (PROCEED) and self-help models. Data were collected between September 2010 and June 2013 and were analyzed in August-December 2014. Statistical significance was set at p{\textless}0.05. Setting/participants In a naturally occurring community setting, a total of 250 Korean Americans with type 2 diabetes were randomized into an intervention group (n=120) or a control group (n=130). Intervention The intervention consisted of key self-management skill-building activities through 12 hours of group education sessions, followed by integrated counseling and behavioral coaching by a team of RNs and community health workers. Main outcome measures Primary (clinical) outcomes were hemoglobin A1c, glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Secondary (psychosocial and behavioral) outcomes included diabetes-related quality of life, self-efficacy, adherence to diabetes management regimen, and health literacy. Results During the 12-month project, the intervention group demonstrated 1.0\%-1.3\% (10.9-14.2 mmol/mol) reductions in hemoglobin A1c, whereas the control group achieved reductions of 0.5\%-0.7\% (5.5-7.7 mmol/mol). The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. The intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in diabetes-related self-efficacy and quality of life when compared with the control group. Conclusions RN/community health worker teams equipped with culturally tailored training can be effective in helping an ethnic/linguistic minority group manage diabetes in the community.Copyright Â© 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

	abstract = {Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are working with an increasing number of families from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds as the world's population continues to become more internationally mobile. The heterogeneity of these diverse populations makes it impossible to identify and document a one size fits all strategy for working with culturally and linguistically diverse families. This paper explores approaches to practice by SLPs identified as specialising in multilingual and multicultural practice in culturally and linguistically diverse contexts from around the world. Data were obtained from ethnographic observation of 14 sites in 5 countries on 4 continents. The sites included hospital settings, university clinics, school-based settings, private practices and Indigenous community-based services. There were 652 individual artefacts collected from the sites which included interview transcripts, photographs, videos, narrative reflections, informal and formal field notes. The data were analysed using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (Engestrom, 1987). From the analysis six overarching Principles of Culturally Competent Practice (PCCP) were identified. These were: (1) identification of culturally appropriate and mutually motivating therapy goals, (2) knowledge of languages and culture, (3) use of culturally appropriate resources, (4) consideration of the cultural, social and political context, (5) consultation with families and communities, and (6) collaboration between professionals. These overarching principles align with the six position statements developed by the International Expert Panel on Multilingual Children's Speech (2012) which aim to enhance the cultural competence of speech pathologists and their practice. The international examples provided in the current study demonstrate the individualised ways that these overarching principles are enacted in a range of different organisational, social, cultural and political contexts. Tensions experienced in enacting the principles are also discussed. This paper emphasises the potential for individual SLPs to enhance their practice by adopting these overarching principles to support the individual children and families in diverse contexts around the world.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

Family: Dynamic, participation and expectations. Child: Chronological Age However, it is common to find higher emphasis on the physiological, cognitive and family aspects decreasing weight in the sociocultural factor who affects rehabilitation. It is therefore important to emphasize on an integral profile from the rehabilitation aproach based on community (RBC). Objective(s): Recognize the importance of an integral profile of the patient with CI, from a Rehabilitation aproach Based on Community. Methods and Results: The 6 patients evaluated, those who belongs to an ethnic community do not get the expected benefits for lack of rehabilitation. The 6 patients have left the device for damage at the accesories, little auditory benefit for lack of programing, little use because of the conditions of sociocultural lif. Conclusion(s): The RBC, involves a process of intervention that can recognize the individual integrally, as a biosocial being, which rehabilitation process canbepotentiated from an individualized intervention work, involving their members, generating training in the community.

	abstract = {Context Suggested benefits of periodic health examinations (PHEs) include opportunities for screening, health promotion, and fostering the doctor-patient relationship. The literature contains little about the PHE from the patients' perspective. Objective To explore patients' feelings about, and experience with, the PHE. Design Quantitative, participatory. Participants English- or French-speaking patients aged 18 or older, receiving at least 1 PHE within the previous 24 months. A random sample of patients of an urban, hospital-based academic family medicine centre was approached by volunteers (themselves patients of that centre) to self-administer a piloted, bilingual, anonymous 24-item survey on perceptions of and experiences with "an annual exam, complete checkup, or periodic health exam," as distinct from a visit for a new problem or follow-up of an existing one. Main outcome measures Likert-style questions exploring patients' experiences with PHEs were predominantly derived from 4 validated tools: the National Survey Programme, the Patient Experience Questionnaire, the Recovery Self-Assessment Person in Recovery survey, and the Recovery Oriented Systems Indicators Consumer Survey 2005. Results Of 196 patients agreeing to participate, 173 were retained in the final data set: 78.6\% were female; the mean age was 48.4 years; mean years of care by the same doctor was 5.1; mean number of visits in the preceding 24 months was 4.9. More than 90\% agreed or strongly agreed that their doctors respected them, listened, and informed them in a clear fashion. Overall 80\% to 90\% agreed or strongly agreed that their doctors were open to options for care, had concern about both medical and psychosocial issues, and recognized their rights to express worries and concerns, or refuse interventions. In total, 62.5\% agreed or strongly agreed that a purpose of PHE visits was to help doctors know them better as people, while only 39.3\% agreed that a purpose was for them to get to know the doctors better. Conclusion Patients identified indicators of care suggesting high patient-centredness. Yet only 3 out of 5 endorsed PHEs as important for doctors to get to know them, and fewer (2 out of 5) saw such visits as opportunities for them to get to know the doctors. Patients might not appreciate what might be necessary to foster meaningful doctorpatient encounters.},

	abstract = {Background: Biospecimen collection from diverse populations can advance cancer disparities research, but are currently underrepresented. Little is known about the baseline knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to biospecimen collection among most racial/ethnic minority populations. Furthermore, appropriate messages that might increase biospecimen donations have yet to be explored and developed. Among Asian Americans, Chinese Americans are the largest subgroup, of which Cantonese-speaking men may have a higher cancer risk because they have the highest smoking prevalence rate (21.7\%) among Californian Chinese, compared to 7.2\% for English-speaking and 14.1\% for Mandarin-speaking men; this rate is higher than the general California population whose rate is 15.2\%. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational seminar on an Asian American community's willingness to donate biospecimens in a randomized, controlled trial. Method(s): We partnered with a community-based clinic, Chinatown Public Health Center (CPHC) in San Francisco, serving Cantonese-speaking Chinese Americans to develop and revise an educational seminar on biospecimen collection. As a community-based participatory research project, the CPHC health education team was a key partner in all aspects of this study including design, recruitment, conduct, data collection, and analysis. Over 700 Chinese Americans from the general community contacted CPHC about the study from a bilingual flyer distributed at CPHC health education outreach events. From the large community response, 511 Chinese American adults were screened, 400 were randomized, and 395 were available for analysis. In the trial, the intervention seminar was compared with a control seminar (cancer prevention) on change in willingness to donate biospecimens. Result(s): At baseline, many were willing to donate a biospecimen (saliva, urine, hair, toenails, blood, unused cancerous tissue) whether healthy or hypothetically had cancer. Also, many would donate because future generations would benefit, and few had concerns about donation. In logistic regression analyses, there was an intervention effect for willingness to donate: urine if had cancer (OR=2.2, 95\% CI: 1.3-3.7), toenails if healthy (OR=2.1, 95\% CI: 1.4-3.2) or had cancer (OR=2.3, 95\% CI: 2.0-2.7), hair if healthy (OR=1.8, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.5) or had cancer (OR=2.8, 95\% CI: 1.9-4.0), and unused cancerous tissue (OR=1.8, 95\% CI:1.2-2.9). There was also an intervention effect for donating because future generations would benefit (OR=2.0, 95\% CI: 1.4-3.0), and this attitude was a strong independent predictor for willingness to donate all biospecimens, whether healthy or had cancer (OR=2.9-4.2). Conclusion(s): Cantonese-speaking Chinese American participants of an educational seminar on biospecimen collection showed greater increases in willingness to donate biospecimens and donating for the benefit of future generations, than participants who attended a control seminar.},

Asian Americans are now the most rapidly growing minority group in the U.S and Chinese American is one of the fast growing subgroups. The purpose of this study was to explore Chinese Americans CRS behaviors using the Theory of Planned Behavior model (TPB) Methods: This study used a prospective, quasi-experimental design. Participants in this study were recruited through a Chinese American community-based organization's homemaker program. The homemaker program has six teams, about 40 homemakers per team, to provide basic care to local elderly clients. The six teams were randomly assigned to one of the three CRS education sessions. Presenters of the educational sessions were all male physicians and different in their race/ethnicity and language capacity: 1) Chinese and Chinese-speaking presenter, 2) Chinese and English-speaking presenter with interpreter; and 3) White and English-speaking presenter with interpreter. A culturally tailored presentation was given during the sessions. Participants who agreed to participate in the study were asked to fill out a bilingual pre- and post-survey. The survey questionnaire included 12 items to determine participants' belief of CRS based on the TPB model: behavioral beliefs, normative beliefs and control beliefs. Each participant was offered a no-cost FOBT kit at the end of the session, and had four weeks to mail back the FOBT kit. The outcomes measures included the intention to have CRS and the return of FOBT card for testing. Result(s): A total of 337 homemakers participated in the education sessions, and 224 met the age criterion ({\textgreater}= 50 years old) and completed the pre and post-survey. There were only 21 male participants. 99\% of the participants were foreign-born and 59\% had no high school education. Only 13\% reported their English speaking skill fair to fluent. About half the participants had a primary care physician and only 27\% have ever had CRS. 61\% of the participants returned their FOBT within 4 weeks. There were significant differences in the returning rates among the 3 groups with the Chinese and English-speaking presenter group had the highest return rate (72\%), follow by White and English-speaking presenter group (61\%) and Chinese and Chinese-speaking presenter group (49\%) (p = .019). Post belief score had a positive association with post-session intention to screen (p = .001), and post-session intention to screen significantly associated with returning the FOBT card (p = .004) even after controlling for group differences. However, there was no significant association between post-session belief score and the return of FOBT card. Conclusion(s): The CRS rates remain suboptimal in the Chinese American population. Our finding suggests that educational sessions not only need to focus on addressing knowledge deficit and clarifying myths, but also need to be motivational to increase intention for screening.},

	volume = {132},
	abstract = {Introduction: Cultural and community specific barriers were identified as reasons for low bystander CPR/AED rates in minorities. No literature exists that explores this issue in the Arab American population, a large ethnic community in the state. Method(s): We performed a cross sectional survey of clients receiving services from ACCESS (Arab Community Center for Economic \& Social Services), the largest Arabic nonprofit organization in Michigan, during a 3 month period. The survey was presented verbally or in writing in English/Arabic. The questions were regarding demographics, CPR/AED knowledge, barriers to CPR training, and how best to inform and train respondents. A 5 point Likert scale was used and descriptive statistics are presented. Result(s): Of 434 potential respondents, 192(44.3\%) completed the survey. Respondents were majority female (58\%), adult (mean age 37) and first generation immigrant (73.9\%). They were low income (66\% {\textless} \$30K/year) and well educated (65\% {\textgreater} H.S. education). They were predominantly Muslims (81\%), 23.8\% lacked English proficiency, and 42\% completed the survey in Arabic. About a third (30.4\%) had prior CPR training. The vast majority (83.8\%) support public CPR education and performance, with 63.1\% believing they are currently capable of understanding and implementing CPR instructions given over the phone. Perceived barriers to CPR performance are listed in Table 1. The most common barrier to learning CPR was availability of nearby CPR courses (17.4\%). Respondents identified the Internet as their preferred source of information and community centers as their preferred site for CPR training. Conclusion(s): Members of the Arabic community are aware of the importance of bystander CPR/AED and are willing to learn and perform CPR. Language and female chest exposure are two specific issues to address when designing community specific CPR/AED program. Internet and community center based initiative were preferred sites for educational programs.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Despite increasing evidence of hearing impairment in older adults being associated with a decline in cognitive and physical function, hearing health care remains complex and expensive for most older adults. Navigating the hearing health care system is challenging for minorities with language and cultural barriers, including older Korean Americans who are predominantly first-generation immigrants. This study aims to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention to provide hearing counseling and affordable amplification devices to older Korean Americans with hearing impairment. Method(s): Our study consisted of 3 stages: (1) development of the intervention through exploratory focus groups, (2) trial of intervention to 10 to 15 older Korean Americans and their communication partners, and (3) qualitative evaluation. Preand postintervention changes were measured in communication, social isolation, depression, quality of life, stigma, and third-party disability. Result(s): We have learned that many older Korean Americans do not seek help for hearing or adopt the use of listening devices due to language and financial barriers along with sociocultural factors related to stigma toward aging and disability. We have developed a culturally tailored program that consists of a 1-hour session that teaches how to use an amplification device and communication tips followed by a group practice session. Preliminary implementation has demonstrated positive responses from the participants. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to report a hearing health care model using a community outreach program in a population of Korean American older adults. A community-based hearing health intervention can be an effective way to address poor access to hearing health care among minority older adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 2011-2014 CATIE developed an Ethnocultural Hepatitis C Outreach project that produced in-language hepatitis C resources and a media campaign for four major immigrant communities living in Ontario: Pakistani, Punjabi, Chinese and Filipino. PURPOSE: Of all the hepatitis C infections reported in Canada, 35 per cent are estimated to be among immigrants (PHAC, 2014). Immigrants also face cultural and linguistic barriers to healthcare, and in Canada immigrant health is shown to decline over time. In-language resources and community development are required to engage these communities in health issues. METHOD(S): The project was developed through partnership and community consultation including community advisory councils. The project implemented a multi-level strategy including education, outreach and social marketing. The education component included facilitator training, a multilingual website, in-language workshops and brochures. Educational tools developed include puzzles, case studies and curriculum. The outreach component included community partnerships and event outreach. The social marketing component included a media campaign across four communities, in print, radio and online. Evaluation activities included collecting key performance indicators (to measure the type and quantity of work performed) and in-person evaluation forms for workshops. RESULT(S): Education: yourlanguage.hepcinfo.ca has hepatitis C information in 9 languages and receives over 1000 visits monthly. Between 2012-2014 43 in-language workshops reached 877 people. Multilingual brochures are available in 6 languages and 16621 have been distributed. Outreach: The project has partnered with 20 organizations. Event outreach each year reaches over 2000 people. Social Marketing: Three waves of a hepatitis C awareness campaign have run in up to 26 ethnocultural print, radio and online outlets. Editorial content was also produced including articles, radio interviews and tv programs. CONCLUSION(S): Meaningful partnership, community engagement and a strong interest to raise awareness of hepatitis C within immigrant communities facilitated the project's success and reach.},

	volume = {30},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Latina immigrants and Haitian women are 15-30 percentage points less likely to be screened for cervical cancer than Non-Hispanics whites (NHWs). Testing for the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is gaining increased acceptance for cervical cancer screening. A major advantage of this approach is that with minimal instruction women can perform the sampling themselves. METHOD(S): Our study was conducted using the Community Based Participatory Research framework in three ethnic communities in Miami-Dade County: Hispanic, Haitian and one mixed. Each of three trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) recruited 200 women aged 30-65 years from various community-based locations and scheduled a subsequent 30-min assessment. Women were randomized to one of three arms; 1) culturally tailored health education materials 2) an individualized 60 min CHW led health education session followed by CHW navigation to a particpating health center for a Pap Smear 3) Individualized health education and the option of having HPV home selfsampling or CHW navigation for a Pap smear at a health center. Our primary outcome was self-report of having cervical cancer screening assessed at 6 months after the initial evaluation done by a research assitant blinded to allocation status. Women lost to followup were considered as not screened. At study exit, all women not having had screening were offered HPV self-sampling. RESULT(S): We assessed 4608 women of whom 1156 were study eligible. Having had a Pap smear in the last 3 years (51 \%) and age (15 \%) were the primary reasons for study ineligibility. We were unable to schedule an initial baseline assessment with 38\% of study eligible women and 11 \% declined to participate. Among the 601 women randomized, mean age was 47+9 years, 67\% had household incomes under \$20,000, and 76\% lacked health insurance. These characteristics and loss to follow-up at 6 months (9-12 \%) were similar across all three arms. Using intention to treat, at 6 months 29 \% of women randomized to health education reported being screened for cervical cancer versus 38 \% in the CHW navigation group and 73 \% in the HPV sampling group (P{\textless}0.05 for group 2 versus group 1, and {\textless}0.01 for group 3 versus group 2 or 1. In pre-planned subgroup analysis, in one community (mixed) where barriers to traditional pap smears screening were minimized, rates of screening were more attenuated in groups 2 versus 3, 58 and 73 \%, respectively as compared to 27 \% in group 1 (p{\textless}.0.01 for all three comparisons). Rates of HPV positivity were highest in the Haitian community 25 \% versus 10 \% and 13 \% in the other two locations (p{\textless}.05). CHWs were able to confirm follow-up and treatment (when needed) in over 90 \% women having an abnormal screen. CONCLUSION(S): We found that among a sample of immigrant predominantly low income and uninsured women, HPV self sampling was considerably superior to health education and CHW navigation to achieve cervical cancer screening. Our findings lend strong support for this screening strategy among hard to reach minority populations.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.10.182},
	abstract = {Purpose: North Carolina (NC) has experienced 943\% growth in the Hispanic/Latino population over the last 20 years. Compared to whites in NC, Latinos face significant health care barriers, such as lack of insurance, access to care, and difficulty communicating with medical providers. Such barriers have potential lifelong implications for the health and well-being of Latino adolescents. Addressing implicit bias within patient-provider relationships may be one intervention point for reducing Latino health disparities. Our trans-disciplinary community-academic team developed and piloted an intervention, Envisioning Health, which used visual images (a photojournalism series documenting the migration journey of Latinos and adolescent-generated images through Photovoice) to engage pediatric residents in an exploration of Latino ethnicity and the experience of migration on health. Our objective was to make transparent to medical providers, the invisible impact of implicit bias on Latino adolescents' health. Method(s): We used the community-based participatory research (CBPR) method of Photovoice with groups of Latino adolescents from different communities. The adolescents took photos and engaged in the facilitated SHOWED/VENCER dialogue process (in English and Spanish) focusing on "What I wish my doctor knew about my life." They organized a forum with pediatric residents to discuss their Photovoice findings and prioritize next steps for enhancing equity in health care interactions and to improve the system of care. Result(s): Four themes emerged: 1) It's hard to develop a good relationship with doctors because teens can tell when doctors don't really care about our feelings, life, economic situation and besides that, the clinic switches our doctor each time we go; 2) Teens are very aware everyday of being judged, suspected, monitored, "up to no good," and expected to fail by people in authority (teachers, MDs, police) - causing teens to avoid interacting with them as normal persons; 3) Because our parents are excluded from many systems, Latino teens are stressed by their conflicting realities of having to play the adult role and advocate for themselves in every arena, but adults don't listen to teens or accord the same respect or benefits as they would to other adults; 4) Having bilingual interpreters, or even native speakers serve as interpreters, doesn't necessarily make the communication problem go away because there is a difference between being bilingual and being bicultural. These findings engaged physicians and Latino adolescents in direct dialogue on how equity in quality of care is compromised by race-specific societal forces of migration and discrimination. Conclusion(s): Promoting authentic dialogue between Latino adolescents and physicians is an essential first step toward designing system change interventions to enhance equity in healthcare quality and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Achieving long-Term retention in HIV care is an important challenge for HIV management and achieving elimination of mother-To-child transmission. Sustainable, affordable strategies are required to achieve this, including strengthening of community-based interventions. Deployment of community-based health workers (CHWs) can improve health outcomes but there is a need to identify systems to support and maintain high-quality performance. Quality-improvement strategies have been successfully implemented to improve quality and coverage of healthcare in facilities and could provide a framework to support community-based interventions. Method(s): Four community-based quality-improvement projects from South Africa, Malawi and Mozambique are described. Community-based improvement teams linked to the facility-based health system participated in learning networks (modified Breakthrough Series), and used quality-improvement methods to improve process performance. Teams were guided by trained quality mentors who used local data to help nurses and CHWs identify gaps in service provision and test solutions. Learning network participants gathered at intervals to share progress and identify successful strategies for improvement. Result(s): CHWs demonstrated understanding of quality-improvement concepts, tools and methods, and implemented quality-improvement projects successfully. Challenges of using quality-improvement approaches in community settings included adapting processes, particularly data reporting, to the education level and first language of community members. Conclusion(s): Quality-improvement techniques can be implemented by CHWs to improve outcomes in community settings but these approaches require adaptation and additional mentoring support to be successful. More research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach on processes and outcomes of care.Copyright Â© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy emphasizes the importance of community-based opportunities for education, such as English as a second language (ESL) programs. It recommends collaborations among the adult literacy and ESL communities. However, limited attention has been given to researching the effectiveness of community-based interventions that combine ESL and health literacy. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using different community settings for improving health literacy among adult Spanish speakers through an English language program. The study used a pre-experimental, single arm pretest-posttest design, and implemented the Health Literacy and ESL Curriculum. A collaborative was established between the community and university researchers. Participants were recruited at three distinctive sites. Health literacy was assessed using the Spanish version of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA). Analysis included descriptive and paired-group t test. Forty-nine participants completed the intervention and post-tests (92\% retention rate). Overall--all sites--posttest scores significantly improved for total TOFHLA, raw numeracy, and reading comprehension (p {\textless} 0.0001). Similarly, all three sites yielded significantly better mean differences for the total TOFHLA score while numeracy and reading comprehension significantly improved in some sites. Results suggest that community sites are viable venues for delivering health literacy/language instruction to Spanish speaking adults. The study also points to community engagement and ESL programs as two essential components of effective health literacy interventions among Spanish speakers.},

Three waves of data were collected to document Latino immigrants' severity of alcohol use problems at pre-immigration and 2 annual post-immigration follow-up assessments. BPHSUP+/- status was used as a predictor of Latinos' (N = 452; 45.8\% female, 54.2\% male) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores at pre- and post-immigration with age, education, and income as covariates as wells as odds ratios for AUDIT classifications of hazardous use, harmful use, and dependence., RESULTS: BPHSUP+ status predicted Latino immigrants' higher AUDIT scores pre- and post-immigration by gender (P {\textless} .01) compared with Latino immigrants of BPHSUP- status, controlling for age, education, and income. BPHSUP+ status predicted odds ratios of 3.45 and 2.91 for AUDIT alcohol dependence classification for men and women, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study documents that BPHSUP+/- status in their country of origin predict their young adult Latino offspring's severity of alcohol use problems pre- and post-immigration. These results may inform (1) community-based health care providers to screen recent young adult Latino immigrants for their BPHSUP+/- status and severity of alcohol use problems to redirect trajectories away from alcohol use disorders toward more normative post-immigration outcomes through culturally relevant prevention services and (2) future research advantages of differential susceptibility theory. Implications for future research and the need for replication studies in other geographic regions of the US are discussed.},

We used ethnically concordant, semistructured, in-depth Spanish-language interviews and a follow-up focus group to explore issues related to communication during pediatric asthma encounters in medical settings. Inductive coding of Spanish transcripts by a bilingual research team was performed until thematic saturation was reached. Several key findings emerged. LEP caregivers encountered significant asthma burdens related to emotional stress, observed physical changes, and communication barriers. Language-discordant communication and the use of ad hoc interpreters were common. This finding is complex, and was influenced by perceptions of interpreter availability, delays in care, feelings of mistrust toward others, and individual emotional responses. Language-concordant education and suitable action plans were valued and desired.

Despite universal screening recommendations, screening rates in the United States remain suboptimal, especially among the poor, the uninsured, recent immigrants, and Hispanics. This article describes the development of a large community-based colorectal cancer screening program designed to address these disparities., METHOD: The Against Colorectal Cancer in our Neighborhoods program is a bilingual, evidence-based, theory-guided, multicomponent community screening intervention, targeting the uninsured and developed using a systematic planning process. It combines community health worker-led outreach, bilingual and culturally tailored community education, and no-cost screening with provision of the fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy and navigation services. A detailed process and outcome evaluation is planned. Program development cost calculated prospectively (in 2011 dollars) using a societal perspective and micro-costing methods was \$243,278, of which \$180,344 was direct cost., DISCUSSION: The detailed description of the development processes and costs of this health promotion program targeting low-income Hispanics will inform health program decision makers about the resource requirements for planning and developing new programs to reduce disease burden in communities.Copyright Â© 2015 Society for Public Health Education.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dissemination of trusted disaster information to limited English proficient (LEP) communities may mitigate the negative effects these higher risk communities experience in disasters. For immigrant communities, disaster messages may be perceived with skepticism, and fear of public officials may affect compliance with disaster messages. This study explores whether medical interpreters (MIs) and bilingual school staff (BSS) are already informal information sources for LEP communities, and could their connection to both public service organizations and LEP communities make them ideal efficient, trusted disaster information conduits for LEP communities., DESIGN: The authors conducted a mixed methods study, which included MI individual interviews, Latino community focus groups, an MI employer survey, and school administrator interviews., SETTING: To ensure diversity in the sample, data were collected in both Los Angeles and Seattle., RESULTS: MIs, MI employers, and schools are willing to communicate disaster information to LEP communities. MIs and BSS are connected to and share information with LEP communities. Latino LEP communities are eager for more disaster information and sources., CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that a multipronged approach that includes collaborating with professionals linked to immigrant communities, such as MIs and BSS, could be an effective method of disaster information dissemination. Working with MIs and BSS as part of a wider dissemination strategy would promote a community-based interpersonal flow of information that would contribute to LEP community's trust in the message.},

Studies have rarely examined interethnic differences in the resilience factors for depression in this diverse population. Greater understanding is needed as the number of older Southeast Asians in the United States increases., OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the association between social connectedness and depressive symptoms in Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian elders., METHODS: Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, bilingual/bicultural staff collected demographics, the Lubben Social Network Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed for the full aggregated sample and for each ethnic subgroup., RESULTS: In the full aggregated sample analysis, Southeast Asian elders were at increased risk for depression and had low social connectedness. Marriage and English proficiency were resilience factors, whereas social connectedness did not play a significant role. In disaggregated analyses, high social connectedness, marriage, and younger age were resilience factors for Vietnamese elders. English proficiency was the only significant resilience factor for Laotians, and age at the time of immigration was the only significant resilience factor for Cambodian elders., CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the need for researchers to disaggregate data for ethnic subgroups in the Asian American population. Southeast Asian elders are at increased risk for depression and have low social connectedness. There exist important interethnic differences in resilience factors for geriatric depression, suggesting the need for more studies and interventions that are sensitive to subtle cultural differences among Southeast Asian subgroups.},

Most were intervention projects (66.0\%). Projects serving American Indian or Alaskan Native (AIAN) populations (compared with other community of color or multiple-race/unspecified) were likely to be descriptive projects (p{\textless}.01), receive less funding (p{\textless}.05), and have higher rates of written partnership agreements (p{\textless}.05), research integrity training (p{\textless}.05), approval of publications (p{\textless}.01), and data ownership (p{\textless}.01).

	abstract = {Clinic-based studies suggest that dementia is diagnosed at older ages in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. The current study sought to test this hypothesis in a large, prospective, community- based study of initially nondemented Hispanic immigrants living in a Spanish-speaking enclave of northern Manhattan. Method(s): Participants included 1,067 participants in the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were tested in Spanish and followed at 18-24 month intervals for up to 23 years. Spanish-English bilingualism was estimated via both self-report and an objective measure of English reading level. Multilevel models for change estimated the independent effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline in 4 domains: episodic memory, language, executive function, and speed. Over the course of the study, 282 participants developed dementia. Cox regression was used to estimate the independent effect of bilingualism on dementia conversion. Covariates included country of origin, gender, education, time spent in the United States, recruitment cohort, and age at enrollment. Result(s): Independent of the covariates, bilingualism was associated with better memory and executive function at baseline. However, bilingualism was not independently associated with rates of cognitive decline or dementia conversion. Results were similar whether bilingualism was measured via self-report or an objective test of reading level. Conclusion(s): This study does not support a protective effect of bilingualism on age-related cognitive decline or the development of dementia. In this sample of Hispanic immigrants, bilingualism is related to higher initial scores on cognitive tests and higher educational attainment and may not represent a unique source of cognitive reserve.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Great strides have been made in improving heart health in the United States during the last 2 decades, yet these strides have not encompassed many ethnic minority populations. There are significant health disparity gaps stemming from both a paucity of valid research and a lack of culturally sensitive interventions. In particular, many Korean Americans with chronic illnesses encounter difficulty navigating the healthcare system because of limited health literacy. METHOD(S): The effect of a multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of High Blood Pressure (HBP) was tested in a community-based clinical trial for Korean American seniors. Of 440 seniors enrolled, 369 completed the study (184 in the intervention group and 185 in the control group; mean age = 70.9 +/- 5.3 years). The intervention group received 6 weekly educational sessions on HBP management skill building, including health literacy training, followed by telephone counseling and home blood pressure (BP) monitoring for 12 months. RESULT(S): Findings support that the Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates for the intervention and control groups were 49.5\% vs. 43.2\% at baseline, 58.5\% vs. 42.4\% at 6 months, 67.9\% vs. 52.5\% at 12 months, and 54.3\% vs. 53.0\% at 18 months. Significant changes were observed over time in some psychobehavioral outcomes, including self-efficacy for BP control, medication adherence behavior, HBP knowledge, and depression. CONCLUSION(S): The study findings suggest that the multimodal Self-Help Intervention Program on the Control of HBP is effective at promoting optimal HBP control for this ethnic/linguistic minority population.

	abstract = {Background Hispanics, particularly those with limited English proficiency, are underrepresented in psychiatric clinical research studies. We developed a bilingual and bicultural research clinic dedicated to the recruitment and treatment of Spanish-speaking subjects in the Predictors of Remission in Depression to Individual and Combined Treatments (PReDICT) study, a large clinical trial of treatment-naive subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Demographic and clinical data derived from screening evaluations of the first 1,174 subjects presenting for participation were compared between the Spanish-speaking site (N = 275) and the primary English-speaking site (N = 899). Reasons for ineligibility (N = 888) for the PReDICT study were tallied for each site. Results Compared to English speakers, Spanish speakers had a lower level of education and were more likely to be female, uninsured, and have uncontrolled medical conditions. Clinically, Spanish speakers demonstrated greater depression severity, with higher mean symptom severity scores, and a greater number of previous suicide attempts. Among the subjects who were not randomized into the PReDICT study, Spanish-speaking subjects were more likely to have an uncontrolled medical condition or refuse participation, whereas English-speaking subjects were more likely to have bipolar disorder or a non-MDD depressive disorder. Conclusion Recruitment of Hispanic subjects with MDD is feasible and may enhance efforts at signal detection, given the higher severity of depression among Spanish-speaking participants presenting for clinical trials. Specific approaches for the recruitment and retention of Spanish-speaking participants are required. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {The Zuni Pueblo is home to an economically disadvantaged population, which faces a public health challenge from the interrelated epidemics of obesity, diabetes and kidney disease. Efforts to decrease the impact of these epidemics have been complicated by historical, economic and cultural barriers, which may limit healthcare utilization. The NIH supported Zuni Health Initiative (ZHI) conducted a study to identify barriers to healthcare in the Zuni Pueblo. Community health representatives (CHRs) led 14 one-hour focus group sessions at which a total of 112 people participated posed unique questions that took into account the Zuni culture to elicit information on perceived barriers to healthcare. Audiotapes were translated and transcribed by bilingual ZHI staff. We reduced the text to thematic categories, constructed a coding dictionary and inserted the text into NVivo 9 program. We identified nine themes emerged regarding the barriers experienced in receiving healthcare and adhering to medical advice. These included distance; transportation; embarrassment; relating to healthcare professionals; navigating the medical system; awareness of available resources; waiting times; adhering to medication; and incentives in health promotion. In conclusion the implementation of culturally appropriate community-based health promotion programs and preventive screening techniques will improve access to healthcare and diminish health disparities.

With accumulating research evidence suggesting that falls can be prevented through exercise, there is an increased public health effort among organizations serving older adults to translate and disseminate evidence-based programs into the community. Such efforts, however, face additional challenges if they are implemented in communities with older adults from different cultural backgrounds and languages. This paper briefly describes a pilot community-based dissemination project, including the initiation, implementation, process, and outcomes, of an evidence-based fall prevention (Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance formerly known as Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance) through a local Area Agency on Aging in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota (USA). Overall, the program was successfully implemented resulting in adoption by local community organizations serving Asian and, to a lesser degree, East African non-English speaking older adults. Bilingual community instructors were trained to lead the classes resulting in broad participation and improved physical performance by the older adults targeted for the intervention. The results from this pilot study indicate that Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance can be implemented with positive results in non-English speaking community settings using bilingual leaders.

	abstract = {Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women, yet significant health disparities exist for high-risk groups, including Latinas, and comprehensive, culturally relevant, and effective prevention intervention models are lacking. We used a systems approach to develop, assess, and pilot a community-based education program for improving outcomes for knowledge/awareness of CVD, cardiometabolic risk, and health behaviors in Latinas. Method(s): Latinas (n=35, mean age 50) participated in a 4-month community-based bilingual preventive cardiovascular education program. Pre/post analyses were for knowledge/awareness of CVD risk factors, symptoms, calling 911; personal risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, family history of CVD); clinical parameters (weight, body mass index [BMI], waist, blood pressure, fasting lipids, and glucose); diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (MetS); and serum inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, high-sensitivity C reactive protein [hsCRP], and interleukin [IL]-12). Result(s): Baseline knowledge/awareness was relatively low, risk factors and MetS prevalent, and serum inflammatory markers elevated. Postintervention, participants demonstrated significant (p{\textless}0.05) improvements in knowledge of symptoms, risk factors for CVD, calling 911, and knowledge/adoption of heart-healthy behaviors. Clinical health status also improved, especially for serum triglycerides (p{\textless}0.05; 21\% decline), prevalence of MetS (from 43\% to 37\% of participants), and serum levels of the proinflammatory TNF-alpha (from 16.9+/-1.11apg/mL to 13.5+/-0.8apg/mL, p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion(s): A bilingual culturally appropriate community-based CVD-prevention program based on health education, medical screenings, and empowerment is a successful, effective, adaptable, and replicable model to significantly improve cardiometabolic risk in Latinas.

Result(s): The Loudoun Breastfeeding Coalition was formed with key stakeholders from the community. Clinical service points and gaps from prenatal to early childhood were analyzed and streamlined. A clinical breastfeeding center with bilingual staff was established. Best-practice clinical protocols were implemented and built into the electronic health record. In 2013, the center provided more than 140 consultations to more than 90 low-income women. The dyads who received lactation support were more likely to breastfeed exclusively at 2, 4, 6 and 9-12 months than those dyads who did not receive support (32\% vs. 24\%, 20\% vs. 13\%, and 17\% vs. 13\%, respectively). Conclusion(s): A best-practice community-based approach was implemented to increase breastfeeding rates in a community health center.},

	abstract = {Aims: Systematic reviews have identified effective interventions for improving cultural competence in diabetes healthcare. This study aimed to explore and design an intervention to cater for the needs of ethnic minority groups (EMGs) with diabetes in Coventry. Method(s): A purposive participatory case study was conducted in one Coventry inner-city practice between April 2012 and March 2013, using weekly participant observations, monthly participatory group meetings and one post-participatory one-to-one semi-structured interview with three patients, four general practice (GP) staff and two multilingual link workers (MLWs). Data were analysed using qualitative methods. The research explored cultural issues with staff and patients within the GP and designed a culturally-competent diabetes service framework. Result(s): The operational activities of this GP involving staff and patients demonstrated both helpful (e.g. some ethnic minority patients with cultural differences being consulted by healthcare professionals from the same ethnic backgrounds, thereby ensuring cultural concordances) and unhelpful practices (e.g. using children to interpret for their parents and at times patients with language barriers consulted without the use of professional or lay interpreters). The practice prioritised the designing of a diabetes specialist multilingual link worker (DSMLW) model, to reduce the inequality in diabetes service provision. Key elements of the model were specialist training of MLWs, referral pathway, information sharing, partnership working, and service commissioning. Conclusion(s): A DSMLW framework to address deficits in GP cultural competence is now ready for pilot testing. Involving a broad group of stakeholders ensures that interventions to improve EMGs' access to effective diabetes care in primary care are appropriate and feasible.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {Purpose: Research suggests that Latino immigrant men face many difficulties in adapting to life in the United States, and previous studies suggest that heavy alcohol use is one coping mechanismin response. The aim of this study was to understand the use and context for use of alcohol among Latino immigrantmen to identify intervention opportunities to reduce heavy alcohol use in this population. Method(s): Our study used a sequential mixed methods approach. In the qualitative phase, Latino immigrant men (N=27) who were current drinkers were recruited fromcommunity-based organizations to participate in focus groups and semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Data were collected in Spanish by trained bilingual research staff. Transcripts were coded and analyzed in Atlas.ti.We then recruited Latino immigrant men (N=104) from a community-based organization to complete an interviewer-administered survey regarding their alcohol use.Measures included: 14-day Timeline Followback, Short Inventory of Problems, Discrimination, and Acculturation Stress. Descriptive analyses were used to identify patterns of alcohol use and social factors associated with unhealthy drinking. Result(s): Both qualitative and quantitative data showed patterns of frequent drinking, including binge drinking at least once a week were common. Men were more likely to drink when feeling lonely, socially isolated, and guilty about being away from their families. Stressors such as language barriers and discrimination were also associated with unhealthy drinking. Drinking helped men feel more strong, confident, friendly and conversational. Negative consequences of drinking included strained family relationships, poor work performance, and job loss. Some men reported readiness to change their drinking, but had little support in their social networks and primarily coped with problems alone. Over a quarter of themen had previously sought help with their drinking through their church or Alcoholics Anonymous. Over half the men were interested in counseling to help them drink less. Conclusion(s): Unhealthy drinking and negative consequences were common in both community samples of Latino immigrant men. Social factors such as discrimination and lack of access to alcohol prevention and treatment programs contribute to these patterns. As such, community-based interventions may help reduce heavy alcohol use in this vulnerable population.},

	title = {Translating a heart disease lifestyle intervention for use in south {Asian} immigrant communities: {Preliminary} results of a pilot randomized controlled trial},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Asians (Asian Indians and Pakistanis) are the second fastest growing ethnic group in the United States (US) and have an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared to other populations. Although lifestyle interventions have shown effectiveness at reducing ASCVD risk in non-Hispanic Whites, evidence suggests that program reach has been limited in South Asian populations. Over 90 \% of US South Asians are immigrants, and there is often a mismatch between the conceptual underpinning of most lifestyle interventions and South Asians' social and cultural context. Through a community-academic partnership, we pilot-tested a culturally-salient, community-based healthy lifestyle intervention and compared it with print health education materials to reduce ASCVD risk factors in a medically underserved South Asian immigrant community. METHOD(S): South Asians in Chicago, 30-59 years, were recruited through a community organization that provides social services to medically underserved South Asians. Participants received community-based screening, and those with at least one ASCVD risk factor (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or overweight/obesity) were randomized into the South Asian Heart Lifestyle Intervention (SAHELI) study and followed for 6 months. The SAHELI intervention group (n=31) attended 6 interactive group sessions that incorporated the deep (values, beliefs, explanatory models) and surface (language) structures of South Asian culture. Classes were led by trained, multilingual health educators and focused on simple health messages, skills-building and self-monitoring related to increasing physical activity, eating a healthful diet, portion control, and stress management and coping. Intervention participants also received biweekly support using motivational interviewing via telephone. The control group (n=32) received translated print education materials containing standard clinical information about ASCVD risk factors and healthy behaviors. Both groups were referred to primary care providers. Outcomes, including weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, health behaviors, knowledge, coping, and exercise confidence were measured at baseline and 3, and 6 months. RESULT(S): Participants' average age was 50 (SD+/-8) years, 63\% were female, 46\% had less than or equal to a high school education, one-third were limited English proficient, and two-thirds had no health insurance. At baseline, mean BMI was 30 kg/m2 (SD+/-4.9), hemoglobin A1c 6.3 (SD +/-1.2), total cholesterol 185 (SD+/-32), and systolic blood pressure 129 (SD+/-17). Compared to the control group, the SAHELI intervention group lost significantly more weight (-3.2 lb, p-value=0.04) and had a greater sex-adjusted decrease in hemoglobin A1c (-0.43 \%, p-value {\textless}0.01) at 6 months. Changes in blood pressure and cholesterol did not differ between the treatment groups. We also observed a significant increase in both intervention and control groups' knowledge and coping. CONCLUSION(S): A lifestyle intervention incorporating the socio-cultural context of underserved South Asian immigrants and delivered in a community setting was more effective at improving ASCVD risk factors than print health education materials. Analyses of accelerometer and 24-hour dietary recall data are underway. A future study will evaluate the long-term effect of SAHELI in a larger sample of US South Asians.},

	volume = {40},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose is to provide an overview of a 20-year research program aimed at testing diabetes self-management education interventions culturally tailored for Mexican Americans residing in an impoverished rural community on the Texas-Mexico border., METHODS: The research program involved focus group interviews to obtain community input, pilot testing to refine instruments and interventions, and community-based randomized controlled trials to examine intervention effects. Here the authors summarize lessons learned related to the (1) overall effects of culturally tailored diabetes self-management education; (2) impact of culture on study design, intervention development, health outcomes, and community acceptance; (3) benefits of and findings from multiple focus groups held over time in the community; and (4) personal and cultural motivators for behavioral change that were evident among study participants., RESULTS: Postintervention reductions in A1C ranged from 1.4 to 1.7 percentage points. Individuals who attended {\textgreater}= 50\% of intervention sessions achieved a 6-percentage point reduction in A1C. Intervention teams included bilingual Mexican American nurses, dietitians, and promotoras, all recruited from the local community. Focus group interviews indicated that a traditional promotora model was not acceptable to the participants who wanted knowledgeable health professionals, or perceived authority figures, to lead intervention sessions while promotoras provided logistical support. Free glucometers and strips, family participation, and interpersonal dynamics within intervention groups motivated individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices., CONCLUSIONS: Culturally tailored diabetes interventions are effective in improving the health of socially disadvantaged minorities who bear a disproportional burden of type 2 diabetes, and these interventions are cost-effective.Copyright Â© 2014 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to refine and expand a culturally tailored individual-level diabetes self-management intervention to a family-level intervention., METHODS: Using community-based participatory research principles, Mexican American adults (n = 12) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and family members (n = 12) in the United States-Mexico border region participated in 6 focus group interviews, conducted by bilingual, bicultural facilitators. Facilitators and barriers to T2DM management were identified. Transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis., RESULTS: Through an iterative analysis process, 5 categories represented participants with T2DM: (1) strategies my family can use to support our managing T2DM, (2) be sensitive to my challenges, (3) stop telling me what to eat or do, (4) how can we peacefully coexist, and (5) I feel supported. Categories identified by family members were (1) changing behaviors together, (2) sharing not controlling, (3) supporting positive behaviors, and (4) your behaviors frustrate me., CONCLUSIONS: The family was reinforced as a major influence for successful T2DM management. Family support requires that families value and develop knowledge and skills for T2DM management. This family intervention builds on family assets and relationships, shifting from traditional externally motivated individual models to create a shared commitment to manage T2DM among Mexican American adults.Copyright Â© 2014 The Author(s).},

	volume = {38},
	doi = {10.1071/AH13168},
	abstract = {The community navigator model was developed to assist four culturally and linguistically diverse communities (Sudanese, Burmese, Pacific Islander Group, Afghani) in south-east Queensland to negotiate the Australian health system and promote health. Using participatory action research, we developed the model in partnership with community leaders and members, the local health department and two non-governmental organisations. Following implementation, we evaluated the model, with the results published elsewhere. However, our evaluation revealed that although the model was accepted by the communities and was associated with positive health outcomes, the financial, social and organisational durability of the model was problematic. Ironically, this situation was inadvertently created by critical decisions made during the development process to enhance the durability and acceptability of the model. This paper explores these critical decisions, our rationale for making those decisions and the four hidden tensions that subsequently emerged. Using a reflective case study method to guide our analysis, we provide possible resolutions to these tensions that may promote the longevity and utility of similar models in the future. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC?: The use of community navigators to assist culturally diverse communities to access health services is not new. Many benefits have been documented for communities, individuals and heath service providers following the use of such models. What is not well documented is how to maintain these models in a safe and cost-effective way within the Australian health system while respecting cultural and community practices and reducing the burden of service delivery on the navigators. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD?: This paper provides a perspective on how the development of community-based service models inherently places them in a position of tension that must be resolved if they are to be long lasting. Four core tensions experienced during the development and implementation of our model in south-east Queensland are explored to develop potential resolutions. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Reducing the tensions inherent in culturally appropriate community-based service models will increase the durability of the approach. By addressing these tensions, we can create a more durable pool of community navigators that can facilitate community empowerment, self-governance of health issues and a sense of community ownership of health services.},

	abstract = {This was a model of community engagement for a Hispanic population in East Harlem, New York City to assess health care decision-making processes, with a focus on end-of-life decisions, among older men and women. The design involved two senior center-based semi-structured focus groups conducted in Spanish and English followed by a series of bilingual skills-building workshops focusing on situational decision-making. All program aspects were conducted between April and June of 2013. The themes for the workshops included: "Getting the most from your pharmacist encounter;" "How to prepare for your primary care visit;" and "I am getting discharged from the hospital: what do I do?" For the two focus groups, 21 community members participated, each of whom self-identified as Hispanic or Latina/o. Ten common themes emerged from a two-stage/two coder, grounded theory-based qualitative analysis and included: Where Community Members Receive Care; General Challenges, Cultural Challenges, and Benefits of Health Care in New York City/East Harlem; Key Facilitators in Health Care Decision Making; Key Facilitators in End-of-Life Decision Making; and Perceptions of Health Care Disparity. Themes and their subcategories, discussed herein, may offer guidance for area health providers and health care delivery entities. This project served as formative, qualitative data collection for a larger scale forthcoming community assessment while offering community benefit related to health decision-making, especially end-of-life decision making, in the context of a rapidly changing urban American health care delivery landscape. Application of this synergistic community benefit and data collection model is recommended for similar and other communities in the U.S. and other countries.},

	abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression are common mental health disorders in the refugee population. High rates of violence, trauma, and PTSD among refugee women remain unaddressed. The process of implementing a mental health screening tool among multiethnic, newly arrived refugee women receiving routine obstetric and gynecologic care in a dedicated refugee women's health clinic is described. The Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15) is a culturally responsive, efficient, validated screening instrument that detects symptoms of emotional distress across diverse refugee populations and languages. An interdisciplinary community partnership was established with a local behavioral health services agency to facilitate the referral of women scoring positive on the RHS-15. Staff and provider training sessions, as well as the incorporation of bicultural, multilingual cultural health navigators, greatly facilitated linguistically appropriate care coordination for refugee women in a culturally sensitive manner. Twenty-six (23.2\%) of the 112 women who completed the RHS-15 scored positive, of which 14 (53.8\%) were Iraqi, 1 (3.8\%) was Burmese, and 3 (11.5\%) were Somali. Among these 26 women, 8 (30.8\%) are actively receiving mental health services and 5 (19.2\%) have appointments scheduled. However, 13 (50\%) are not enrolled in mental health care because of either declining services (46.2\%) or a lack of insurance (53.8\%). Screening for mental disorders among refugee women will promote greater awareness and identify those individuals who would benefit from further mental health evaluation and treatment. Sustainable interdisciplinary models of care are necessary to promote health education, dispel myths, and reduce the stigma of mental health.Copyright (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).},

The program provided information on topics such as heart health, physical activity, nutrition, diabetes, healthy weight, community health, and emotional well-being; included individual and group activities aimed at motivating behavior change; and encouraged participants to engage in brisk physical activity., RESULTS: We found significant decreases from baseline to conclusion in body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, weight, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. From baseline to 3-month follow-up, we found significant decreases in body mass index, waist circumference, weight, LDL cholesterol, and glucose, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Outcomes for Meta Salud were similar to those found for Pasos Adelante., CONCLUSION: The physiological improvements found among participants in Meta Salud and comparable changes among participants in Pasos Adelante suggest a scalable and effective behavioral intervention for regions of the United States and Mexico that share a common boundary or have similar cultural and linguistic characteristics.},

Method(s): A multilingual 78-min DVD and 66-page manual were produced for homebased instruction. Content addresses attitudes and communication about touch in cancer, psychological preparation for giving and receiving touch, safety precautions, massage techniques for comfort and relaxation, acupressure for specific cancer-related symptoms, and practice in the home setting. Materials were produced in English, Spanish, and Chinese versions. A community-based multiethnic sample of 97 adult patient/caregiver dyads was randomized to experimental (massage) or attention control (reading) groups for 4 weeks. Massage dyads received the program and instructions to practice at least three times per week, while control caregivers read to their patients for the same frequency. Self-report instruments assessed change in symptom severity, quality of life, perceived stress, and caregiver attitudes. Result(s): Significant reductions in all symptoms occurred for patients after both activities: 12-28 \% reductions after reading vs. 29-44 \% after massage. Massage caregivers showed significant gains in confidence, comfort, and self-efficacy using touch and massage as forms of caregiving. Conclusion(s): Multimedia instruction in touch and massage methods may offer family members a viable means of enhancing self-efficacy and satisfaction in caregiving while decreasing patient pain, depression, and other symptoms. Family members may be able to learn and apply safe and simple methods that increase patient comfort and reduce distress. Â© 2012 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Context: Latinos have one of the highest prevalences of obesity in the U.S. Efforts to address U.S. Latino health have expanded to include obesity prevention and treatment initiatives. The objectives of this review were to (1) conduct a systematic review of obesity-related treatment interventions targeting U.S. Latino adults and (2) develop evidence-based recommendations to inform culturally relevant strategies for obesity treatment targeting U.S. Latino adults. Evidence Acquisition: Obesity treatment interventions, published between 1990 and 2010, were identified through a systematic search of electronic databases conducted between January 2010 and December 2011. Details of the screening process and selection/exclusion criteria are reported in the Guide to Obesity Prevention in Latin America and the U.S. (GOL) parent study. Evidence Synthesis: Of the 325 studies identified in the GOL parent study, 105 met the inclusion criteria, and 22 involved obesity treatment interventions for Latinos and were included in the present review. The 22 studies were evaluated (between January 2010 and December 2011) for strength of study design and execution; effect sizes were also estimated for treatment effects on obesity-related outcomes. Interventions for physical activity or diet behavioral changes with strong or sufficient evidence included (1) community-based, culturally relevant, RCTs, and non-randomized controlled trials; (2) church-based interventions; and (3) promotora-led interventions. Conclusion(s): Most interventions targeted physical activity and/or diet behavioral modification in Latinas and were led by bicultural/bilingual professionals. Potential key intervention settings include community clinics/centers and churches. Although there was limited literature on obesity treatment interventions for U.S. Latinos, the review findings provide valuable insight to researchers and practitioners involved in obesity treatment for U.S. Latino adults.

	abstract = {Background: India, with 2.4 million people living with HIV and 120,000 annual HIV-incident infections, has the highest disease burden of HIV in Asia, and a concentrated epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM). Yet out of {\textgreater}235 HIV vaccine trials conducted globally, two phase-I trials were completed in India. Investigations of willingness to participate (WTP) in HIV vaccine trials have focused predominantly on individual-level determinants and high-income countries. We explored multi-level factors associated with WTP among MSM in India. Method(s): We conducted a qualitative investigation using a community- based approach; community-based organizations (CBOs) in Chennai and Mumbai collaborated in study design, instrument development, data collection and interpretation. Twelve focus groups (n=68) with low-socioeconomic MSM and 14 key informant interviews with MSM community leaders/service providers were recorded, transcribed and translated into English. Two bilingual investigators conducted thematic analysis using line-by-line, axial and focused coding and a constant comparative method, with member-checking by community representatives. Results : Factors associated with WTP were evidenced across the social ecology of MSM - social-structural: poverty, HIV-, sexual- and gender non-conformity stigma, institutionalized discrimination; community-level: endorsement by MSM community leaders/organizations, fear of in-group discrimination; interpersonal: anticipated family discord, partner rejection, financially-dependent family members, sexual orientation disclosure; and individual-level: HIV vaccine trial knowledge/ misconceptions, safety concerns, altruism and preventive misconception. Conclusion(s): Decision-making about WTP was embedded in social-structural, community and familial spheres of influence. By focusing on individual-level determinants of WTP we risk misunderstanding and misconceptualizing barriers and motivators to participation, failing to mitigate ethical challenges and may thereby limit the effectiveness of interventions designed to support recruitment and retention in biomedical HIV prevention trials. Combatting stigma and discrimination against MSM and people living with HIV, supporting research literacy among low-socioeconomic communities and capacity-building for MSM CBOs may advance meaningful engagement of MSM in India in HIV vaccine trials.},

	abstract = {Background: Community Based Research (CBR) methodologies are now a well-established part of the Canadian HIV response. Key tenets of CBR include a focus on community input and on shared ownership. As such, the process of the research, much like the results, belongs equally to researchers and collaborators. Despite the wide recognition of these fundamental principles, challenges emerge when translating these principles into practice within national CBR projects where Francophone and Anglophone realities must be navigated. Objective(s): 1) To present challenges to collaborations in the context of national, community based, HIV research projects; 2) to further our understanding of common pitfalls drawing on two Quebec research coordinators' experiences from two ongoing CBR projects; the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS) and the Food Security Study, both of which are conducted in Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia; 3) to elicit a critical reflection of CBR practices to improve further collaborations. Lessons Learned: Drawing lessons from both national CBR studies allowed us to observe similarities in challenges faced and successes achieved. These challenges included; 1) a tendency towards homogenization of methods and centralization of power and funds; 2) insufficient anticipation of cultural and linguistic differences; 3) insufficient resources dedicated to translation and cultural adaptation; 4) and disparities in allotting the burden of translation and related human resources. Successful strategies included: 1) establishing protocols for translation from project inception; 2) building these steps into study timelines; 3) allotting sufficient central funds for translation; 4) promoting local autonomy and leadership; 5) and importantly, acknowledging that successfully navigating French and English realities is crucial to national CBR work. Recommendations : The expansive use of CBR strategies has meant the institutionalization and nationalization of participatory research strategies. However, in nationalizing CBR, new challenges have emerged. Experiences from the CHIWOS and the Food Security Project offer helpful lessons for future projects: in order to truly democratize research, we must also reinforce the capacity of local communities to change the face of HIV research in Canada.},

	volume = {128},
	abstract = {Background: Great strides have been made in improving the nation's heart health during the last two decades, health disparities still exist within many ethnic minority populations. These individuals often suffer from insufficient health literacy, which severely limits their ability to make appropriate health decisions. In particular, as a member of first generation immigrant groups, Korean American seniors (KAS) with chronic disease such as hypertension encounter very stiff language and cultural barriers to accessing the complicated U.S health care system and have only limited personal resources. Purposes/ methods: To address this unmet health need of this underserved group, we designed a community-based clinical trial to test the efficacy of a comprehensive HBP management program that focused on health literacy among Korean American senior (KAS). The health literacy self-help intervention program for HBP (HL-SHIP-HBP) was a community-based, prospective controlled trial targeting KAS with hypertension in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Using an adaptive stratified randomization method, we selected a total of 22 ethnic Korean churches and senior centers in the region for use as study sites on the basis of their size and location, then randomly assigned each of them as either an intervention group site or control group site. Eligible members from each site were then screened and enrolled in the study. Eligibility criteria: Participants were Korean Americans 60 years of age or older, with systolic BP (SBP) {\textgreater} 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) {\textgreater} 90 mm Hg on two separate measurements or on antihypertensive medication. Result(s): A total of 369 KAS (mean age, 70.9 +/- 5.3 years) completed the program: 184 in the intervention and 185 in the control group. Main outcomes were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The findings indicate that the program (HL-SHIP-HBP) was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates of the intervention and control groups were 49.5\% vs. 43.2\% at baseline, 58.5\% vs. 42.4\% at 6 months, 67.9 vs. 52.5 at 12 months, and 54.3\% vs. 53.0\% at 18 months. The potential contribution of health literacy to the long-term sustainability of HBP control will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Memory for familiar music is retained in by people with dementia despite deteriorations in other areas of functioning and music-based interventions have achieved some success in elevating mood, decreasing BPSD and increasing engagement. Yet few studies of group singing to music have been reported in this population. Purpose(s): This presentation provides an overview of the literature on singing-based interventions for people with dementia. It also reports on a recent pre and post repeated measures pilot study of the effect of choir participation on mood, engagement, BPSD and quality of life in participants from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds attending day respite but reported as difficult to engage in most activities. Method(s): Participants (n = 7, mean age = 78, 5 male, 1 female, 3 Greek and 3 Italian first generation bilingual immigrants) attended 8 weekly sessions of guitar-accompanied choir singing in English, Italian and Greek facilitated by a trained music therapist with dementia expertise. Measures (baseline, mid, immediate post and 4 weeks post) included cognitive status (baseline, 4 weeks post only), BPSD, social interaction, engagement mood/depression, sleep and quality of life. Carer measures were BPSD burden, sleep and mood. All participants were videotaped in a randomised schedule in each session for coding by two trained staff using Noldus Observer XT. Result(s): Statistically significant improvements in mood, BPSD engagement and QoL from Baseline were found, retained one-month post intervention for mood and QoL. All participants were engaged more than 98\% of the time they were singing, but showed greater positive affect during repetitive choruses or in songs sung in their own first language. Findings suggest a larger rigorous trial is warranted.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in vision impairment are prevalent as are low rates for recommended eye screenings, such as annual dilated eye exams for people with diabetes (40-65 \%). A communityacademic partnership aimed to improve vision screening in a low-income, minority neighborhood by developing a multi-component vision health toolkit for social service providers to promote comprehensive vision exams among their consumers. METHOD(S): The team developed and tested a bilingual toolkit that included posters, brochures, table tents and magnifier cards. Thirty-seven local social service agencies (i.e., senior centers, food pantries), faith-based organizations and health centers were recruited to adopt the toolkit and have at least one staff member or volunteer serve as a Vision Health Champion for that site. We surveyed a subset of consumers at 15 intervention and 3 control sites before and 6 months after disseminating the toolkits to assess receipt of comprehensive eye exams, vision knowledge and comorbidities, and surveyed Vision Health Champions to assess implementation and provider knowledge at these same times. RESULT(S): The 156 consumers surveyed were largely female (68 \%), Black (55 \%) and had high diabetes (23 \%) and hypertension (33 \%) rates. At baseline, 72 \% reported an eye exam in the past year and vision knowledge was fairly high (91 \% correctly answered 3 or more out of 7 vision knowledge items). There was no baseline difference between intervention and control sites self-reported eye exam rates in the past year. Six month follow-up surveys were completed with 62 \% of consumers. People at intervention sites were more likely to report a comprehensive eye exam in the past 6 months (45 \% vs. 24 \%, p=0.06). Those with diabetes at intervention sites were also more likely to have had an eye exam in the past 6 months than those with diabetes at control sites (66 \% vs. 33 \%, p{\textless}0.01). With respect to 44 of 61 Vision Health Champions surveyed at follow-up (72 \% response rate), 80 \% stated that the toolkit was easy to implement, 32 \% integrated it into pre-existing programming and 90 \% planned to continue using it. CONCLUSION(S): Even in a small pilot project, we demonstrated a significant increase in comprehensive eye examinations at intervention sites compared with control sites and among the targeted group - individuals with diabetes. We further demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a sustainable community-based intervention in a low-income setting at locations where people frequently congregate and interact with a range of social service providers. Novel, scalable approaches such as the use of Vision Health Champions in social service settings are a viable means of preventing and controlling diabetes complications, including vision loss.},

	doi = {10.1111/acer.12162},
	abstract = {Purpose: Research suggests that Latino immigrant men face many difficulties in adapting to life in the United States with previous studies suggesting that heavy alcohol use is one coping mechanism in response. The aim of this study was to understand alcohol use and service needs among Latino immigrant men as a basis for development of an intervention to reduce heavy alcohol use in this population. Method(s): Latino immigrant men (N = 27) who were current drinkers and mental health and substance use providers (N = 13) were recruited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured 1:1 interviews. Data were collected in Spanish and English by trained bilingual research staff and recorded. Recordings were transcribed, then transcripts were coded and analyzed in Atlas.ti. Each transcript was coded by twomembers of the research staff. Case summaries and coded quotations were reviewed to identify themes. Result(s): Patterns of alcohol use included frequent drinking which often occurred daily or several times a week. Binge drinking was also common. Most men chose to drink at home or in "hidden" public areas where they would not be seen by authorities. Men were more likely to drink when feeling lonely, social isolated, and guilty about being away from their families. Men reported that drinking helped them feel stronger, and more confident, friendly and conversational. Some men reported wanting to decrease their drinking, but did not have support in their social networks and primarily coped with problems alone. Both providers and the men reported knowing about Alcoholics Anonymous, but did not feel comfortable going to meetings even though they stated a desire to seek treatment. Providers noted that there was a lack of substance use prevention and treatment programs focused on Latino immigrant men. Providers and male drinkers believed that screening and brief intervention offered in community settings (such as day labor worker centers, and community-based organizations) would be a culturally responsive and effective approach to reduce and prevent heavy drinking among Latino immigrantmen. Conclusion(s): Unhealthy drinking and negative consequences were common among this sample of Latino immigrantmen. As such, community based screening and intervention may help reduce heavy alcohol use in this vulnerable population.},

	volume = {61},
	abstract = {Purpose of Study: Cancer is the 2nd highest cause of mortality in Latinos after heart disease. Both of these illnesses have genetic as well as environmental components. Although overall rates of incidence and mortality are lower in Latinos than Whites, Latinos are diagnosed at more advanced stages of common cancers. The goals of this project were threefold a) educate Latinos on the value of knowing one's family health history b) connect Latinos with community resources for cancer screening, c) ultimately increase provider-patient communication around family health history and early detection in the clinical setting. Methods Used: A literature review was conducted to determine best practices for delivery of this project; published literature suggested collaboration with community organizations, along with bilingual presentations for Latinos of all educational backgrounds. Clinical staff and providers were consulted. Educational posters were made; collaboration with community partners yielded helpful brochures. Using self-reported family health history, community members were informed of sponsored cancer screening services and a sliding scale clinic at a community center health fair for almost 200 community members in Southwest Seattle. Motivational interviewing in Spanish and English was employed to empower community members to make lifestyle changes and to seek resources early to reduce cancer risk factors. Summary of Results: This presentation served as a pilot for bridging the gap between environmental and genetic disease risk. All community members remarked that they had not seen a focus on family health history and wanted to learn more about how to communicate disease risk with their provider. Staff \& community members stressed the importance of continuing to have providers address family health history in a culturally sensitive but helpful way. Conclusion(s): Awareness of family health history has a role in preventive health, particularly in early detection for at risk families. Family health history may be more reliably acquired if patients feel that their family history if important in their own health. Community stakeholders, in partnership with providers, can mediate awareness of family health and promote healthy lifestyles, including regular cancer screening and access to primary care.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite high stroke risk, few Korean-American stroke prevention interventions have been done. We examined conceptions of stroke, including knowledge of risk factors (RFs), symptoms (Sx), prevention, cultural beliefs and perceived consequences, in elderly Korean-Americans. Results were to inform the design of effective and culturally relevant interventions for Korean-American seniors. Method(s): Twenty-nine senior Korean-Americans were recruited from 3 locations in southern California: a Korean-American megachurch, and a private and a non-profit adult day health care centers for elderly Korean-Americans. Subjects completed a questionnaire on stroke RFs and Sx, health information sources, health care barriers, personal medical history, comfort with English, and year of immigration. In 3 moderator-facilitated focus groups (FGs), subjects discussed: 1) knowledge of stroke Sxs and RFs, and what to do when stroke occurs; 2) cultural attitudes and perceptions about stroke; 3) personal anecdotes about stroke; 4) preferred methods of education intervention. Discussion audiotapes were transcribed, translated from Korean to English, and validated by 2 bilingual researchers. English transcripts were coded by themes and subthemes independently by 3 raters, who after discussion, came to consensus. An 8-member Community Advisory Panel guided development of discussion guide questions and translations, and collaborated in interpretation. Result(s): Mean age of subjects was 79.7 years, 62\% were female. Mean years in U.S. was 23.9; 24\% had less than 8th grade education. 62\% had history of hypertension; 59\% had high cholesterol. 86\% reported hypertension as a stroke RF, and slurred speech was most commonly identified as a stroke Sx (76\%). Television (66\%) and physician (59\%) were the most common health information sources. 24\% had difficulty accessing health care in the past year, with 62\% citing discomfort with English language as the hindrance to access. In FGs, RFs emphasized were hypertension and family history, and the most common Sx discussed was being "knocked out." A common stroke prevention theme was the balance of medication and wellness (exercise/diet). Cultural perceptions of stroke included "destiny," and beliefs about the efficacy of blood-letting, acupuncture, and Oriental herbs. Attitudes towards stroke included fear and worry: though some viewed death as "fate," others felt need for education. For stroke prevention, most preferred visual-aid presentations by Korean-speaking medical professionals in a locale familiar to senior Korean-Americans. Conclusion(s): Elderly Korean-Americans have substantial risk for stroke, but possess both language and belief barriers that may interfere with stroke prevention and response. A stroke education curriculum tailored for elderly Korean-Americans must address these culturally specific beliefs to be effective.},

The purpose of this project was to develop and implement a Punjabi version of an English Diabetes Self-Management Program and make it available to Punjabi adults with type 2 diabetes in the Fraser Valley area of BC. This peer-led program provides participants with confidence, knowledge and skills to manage their diabetes. Method(s): A bilingual coordinator was employed and arranged the translation and cultural adaptation of English manuals and materials. Fifty bilingual (Punjabi and English) volunteers with diabetes were recruited and trained as program leaders and, in pairs, delivered 15 6-week programs to 170 Punjabi-speaking adults. Research Observations: Four focus group meetings were held (1 with 22 leaders and 3 involving 30 participants) to obtain perspectives of the program. As well, participants completed the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) questionnaire before they started the program and again at 6 months. Conclusion(s): Leaders and participants reported changes in behaviours (i.e. diet, physical activity and taking medication), improvement in psychological status (i.e. less stress, fear and pessism regarding future health), increases in confidence (selfefficacy) in managing their health and greater community involvement. The PAM scores indicated higher activation at 6 months. The project developed an accessible and culturally relevant diabetes program for the Punjabi-speaking population in their first language, established an implementation system involving numerous community partnerships and is currently being offered on a permanent basis.},

The objective of this study was to identify strategies for successfully recruiting and retaining diverse racial/ethnic communities into PBRN research studies. This collaborative, multisite study engaged 5 of the 8 networks of the PRImary care MultiEthnic Network (PRIME Net) consortium that conducts research with traditionally underrepresented/underserved populations. We used a sequential, qualitative research design. We first conducted 1 key informant interview with each of 24 researchers experienced in recruiting research participants from 5 racial/ethnic communities (African American, Arab/Chaldean, Chinese, Hispanic, and Native American). Subsequently, we conducted 18 focus groups with 172 persons from these communities. Participants' comments indicated that successful recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations in PBRN studies is linked to the overall research process. This process, which we termed the cycle of trust, entailed developing and sustaining relationships of trust during 4 interrelated stages: before the study, during study recruitment, throughout study conduct, and after study completion. Participants identified a set of flexible strategies within each stage and called for close engagement with clinic and community partners. Our participants suggest that approaches to research that lay a foundation of trust, demonstrate respect for community members, and extend beyond the enrollment and data collection phases are essential to enhance the participation of diverse populations in PBRN research. These findings offer the PBRN community a guide toward achieving this important goal.},

	doi = {10.1353/cpr.2013.0049},
	abstract = {Background: Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Queensland, Australia, do not access health services, contributing to poor health outcomes. To improve health in CALD communities, a partnership was formed between the state government, two nongovernment CALDspecific organizations (NGOs), and a university to develop a service that could facilitate health service use. This qualitative research explored the partners' perspectives on how the partnership functioned and its outcomes. Objective(s): We sought to (1) explore how participants engaged with the principles of partnership, the processes they used, and their beliefs about the facilitators and barriers to intersectoral collaboration and (2) gain insights into how the partners perceived the development and functioning of the partnership. Method(s): Qualitative, semistructured interviews were conducted with each of the key stakeholders in the partnership (n = 4). A focus group was also conducted with those working within the two NGO partners in the delivery of the service (n = 8). Open-ended questions drawn from the literature on partnership principles were used to guide the interviews and focus group data collection. The data were transcribed and analyzed using thematic principles. Result(s): The four themes identified were: (1) Perceived benefits of the partnership outweighed organizational differences; (2) respectful relationships sustained the partnership; (3) mitigating conflict enabled the purpose of the partnership to be fulfilled; and (4) a neutral interpersonal space enabled the partnership to be enacted. Conclusion(s): Our study showed how contextual pressures created within the system can damage tenuous connections that have been developed between otherwise competitive organizations, leading to dissolution of partnerships. However, the study has also shown that partnerships may be purpose and time bound, not necessarily with respect to longevity. Through strategic negotiations, partnerships can be sustained until the goal of the partnership is attained, which in this instance was the development of a new service delivery model.

	volume = {72},
	abstract = {Increasingly, health scientists are becoming aware that research collaborations that include community partnerships can be an effective way to broaden the scope and enhance the impact of research aimed at improving public health. Such collaborations extend the reach of academic scientists by integrating a variety of perspectives and thus strengthening the applicability of the research. Communication challenges can arise, however, when attempting to address specific research questions in these collaborations. In particular, inconsistencies can exist between scientists and community members in the use and interpretation of words and other language features, particularly when conducting research with a biomedical component. Additional challenges arise from differing perceptions of the investigative process. There may be divergent perceptions about how research questions should and can be answered, and in expectations about requirements of research institutions and research timelines. From these differences, misunderstandings can occur about how the results will ultimately impact the community. These communication issues are particularly challenging when scientists and community members are from different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds that may widen the gap between ways of talking and thinking about science, further complicating the interactions and exchanges that are essential for effective joint research efforts. Community-driven research that aims to describe the burden of disease associated with Helicobacter pylori infection is currently underway in northern Aboriginal communities located in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, with the goal of identifying effective public health strategies for reducing health risks from this infection. This research links community representatives, faculty from various disciplines at the University of Alberta, as well as territorial health care practitioners and officials. This highly collaborative work will be used to illustrate, from a researcher's perspective, some of the challenges of conducting public health research in teams comprising members with varying backgrounds. The consequences of these challenges will be outlined, and potential solutions will be offered.},

	volume = {104},
	abstract = {Objectives: Within health care, there are underserved groups. New Brunswick's French-speaking minority, which also mostly lives in rural communities, is one such group. A physician shortage potentially prevents this population from accessing health promotion and clinical prevention services. This study analyzes whether New Brunswick Francophone doctors with rural backgrounds are more likely than doctors from urban regions to set up practice in rural communities of the province. Method(s): A questionnaire was sent to 390 New Brunswick Francophone physicians admitted in medicine between 1973 and 2000. It collected information on geographic origin and history of medical practice. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify whether a rural background is associated with the likelihood of ever and currently practicing in rural communities. We used the General Practice Rurality Index-simplified to quantify the rurality level of communities. Result(s): In total, 264 (67\%) physicians participated. A rural background was positively associated with the establishment of a first medical practice in a rural community. This relationship was only significant among family physicians. There was no statistically significant relationship between rurality of community of origin and rurality of current community of practice among either family or specialty physicians. Conclusion(s): Although Francophone doctors with a rural background were more likely than their urban counterparts to set up their first practice in a rural community, this effect was not sustained. This raises questions as to why they leave rural communities and highlights the importance of measures to retain doctors as a way to promote public health for underserved rural groups.

	abstract = {Objective: This study sought to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of a collaborative care model with a predominantly Hispanic, low-income population in a primary care setting and (2) examine depression outcomes with a subpopulation of preferentially Spanish-speaking patients compared with non-Hispanic white participants. Method(s): The data were collected from September 2006 through September 2009 at the study site, the People's Community Clinic, Austin, Texas. Data collection was part of an evaluation of the Integrated Behavioral Health program, a collaborative care model of identifying and treating mild-to-moderate mental disorders in adults in a primary care setting. A bilingual care manager provided supportive counseling and patient education and systematically tracked patient progress in a patient registry. A consulting psychiatrist evaluated patients with diagnostic or treatment concerns. The study retrospectively examined changes in depression scores among 269 subjects as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the primary outcome measure. The PHQ-9 is a self-report of frequency of symptoms for each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria for depression. Logistic regression models compared race/ethnicity and language group combinations on their odds of achieving clinically meaningful depression improvement when background characteristics were controlled for. Result(s): Spanish-speaking Hispanic patients had significantly greater odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement in depression at 3-month follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 2.45, P =.013) compared to non-Hispanic whites. The finding for greater improvement in the Spanish-speaking population remained after controlling for age, sex, medical comorbidities, prior treatment, and baseline depression scores. Conclusion(s): The results suggest a model of care that is effective for a population at great risk for marginal mental health care, non-English-speaking Hispanics. Attention to patient preferences in primary care is essential to improve quality of depression treatment and may improve outcomes. In light of previous research that demonstrates insufficient evidence-based guidelines for patients with limited English proficiency and evidence that evaluation of patients in their nonprimary language or through an interpreter can lead to inaccurate mental health assessments, this study suggests an opportunity to improve the quality of mental health care for non-English-speaking Hispanics in the United States.

Method(s): Forty-one Korean adults with type 2 diabetes participated in a 2-session CTCDSP delivered by a bilingual nurse practitioner at a Korean community center. Outcome measures included biological, behavioral, and general health well-being; diabetes knowledge; and self-efficacy assessed at baseline, post-education, and 3-month follow-up. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to explore mean differences in outcomes across the 3 assessment points. Result(s): From baseline to 3-month follow-up assessment, participants exhibited significant improvement on several physiological and behavioral measures. Mean levels of hemoglobin A1c and waist circumference decreased, whereas high-density lipoprotein levels increased. Additionally, participants reported an increase in weekly feet checks, and there was a trend increase in participants' reported frequency of exercise activities. The feasibility of the CTCDSP was established, and participant satisfaction with the program was high. Conclusion(s): A short-duration CTCDSP may be an effective, feasible, and favorably received approach to improving diabetes outcomes in Korean and potentially other underserved ethnic minority immigrants who have limited access to mainstream clinic-based diabetes self-management programs.

	abstract = {Objective: To examine racial/ethnic differences in diet and physical activity behaviors in ethnic minority New York City children. Method(s): Cross-sectional data from a community-based study of 486 6- to 8-year-old children were used. Race/ethnicity was derived using a caregiver's report of child's race and Hispanic ancestry. Dietary intake was obtained by 24-hour diet recalls using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Physical activity was assessed with pedometers and caregiver interviews. We compared diet and activity measures across racial/ethnic subgroups using chi-square and analysis of variance tests. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, and caregiver education (with breastfeeding history and total energy intake included in diet models). Result(s): Participants (N = 486) were categorized as Mexican (29.4\%), Dominican (8.4\%), Puerto Rican (20.6\%), other/mixed Hispanic (14.0\%), or non-Hispanic black (27.6\%). Obesity rates were lower in non-Hispanic blacks (18\%) than in Hispanics (31\%). Mexicans had the lowest obesity rates among Hispanic subgroups (25\%), and Dominicans had the highest (39\%). There were differences in mean daily servings of food groups, with Mexicans having healthier diets and Puerto Ricans and non-Hispanic Blacks having less healthy diets. Sedentary time was lower in Mexicans than in other groups in adjusted models. Examination of additional models, including home language, did not show significant differences in the estimates. Conclusion(s): Diet and activity behaviors varied across racial/ethnic subgroups. Specifically, Mexican children had healthier diets, the least amount of sedentary time, and the lowest rates of obesity among the Hispanic subgroups examined. Targeted interventions in ethnic subgroups may be warranted to address specific behaviors. Copyright Â© 2012 by Academic Pediatric Association.},

Using a community-based participatory research approach, we elicited perceptions about TB among immigrant and refugee learners and staff at a diverse adult education center. Community partners were trained in focus groups moderation. Ten focus groups were conducted with 83 learners and staff. Multi-level, team-based qualitative analysis was conducted to develop themes that informed a model of TB perceptions among participants. Multiple challenges with TB control and prevention were identified. There were a variety of misperceptions about transmission of TB, and a lack of knowledge about latent TB. Feelings and perceptions related to TB included secrecy, shame, fear, and isolation. Barriers to TB testing include low awareness, lack of knowledge about latent TB, and the practical considerations of transportation, cost, and work schedule conflicts. Barriers to medication use include suspicion of generic medications and perceived side effects. We posit adult education centers with large immigrant and refugee populations as excellent venues for TB prevention, and propose several recommendations for conducting these programs. Content should dispel the most compelling misperceptions about TB transmission while clarifying the difference between active and latent disease. Learners should be educated about TB in the US and that it is curable. Finally, TB programs that include learners and staff in their design and implementation provide greater opportunity for overcoming previously unrecognized barriers.},

Method(s): From 2003 to 2009, 2281 community members participated in CBPPs conducted by the Beaumont Cancer Institute in cooperation with the Arab American and Chaldean (AAC) Council, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. The study population consisted of 1067 individuals who completed a postcancer forum survey: 642 from the African American (AA) and 425 from the AAC forums. Data were collected on participants' screening history and participation in subsequent screening tests after the previous year's CBPP. Result(s): Following attendance of at least one cancer forum the previous year, 329 (30.8\%) of the 1067 participant respondents underwent some type of cancer screening, 32\% in the AA forums and 28.9\% in the AAC forums. Compared with published controls, the CBPPs led to a 38.6\% increase in mammographic screening and a 28.7\% increase in prostate-specific antigen screening; the AA cohort had 39.7\% and 28.4\% increases whereas the AAC cohort had 36.3\% and 28.9\% increases in mammographic and prostate-specific antigen screening, respectively. Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that implementing CBPPs are feasible in underscreened ethnic minority populations. Further studies need to be performed to determine the absolute benefit of CBPPs compared with baseline levels of screening within these ethnic minority populations.

This approach was essential to gain insight into the health beliefs, attitudes, and practices of selected communities. The vulnerable population conceptual model (VPCM) provided a framework for the study. The CBPR, a collaborative research approach, and the VPCM provided the basis for the development of culturally competent research strategies. Strategies and lessons learned to be particularly effective for this CBPR study included (a) developing an in-depth understanding of the community ethnic culture; (b) developing mutual respect and trust with community members and study participants; (c) appreciating and praising community partners' knowledge, expertise, and experiences; (d) developing a sense of ownership by incorporating their needs, ideas, suggestions, and opinions and empowering study participants to make decisions concerning the study approach and wording; (e) soliciting participant feedback and clarification of study results and involving them in disseminating the study findings to their community; and (f) having fun with them and encouraging them to have fun.

	abstract = {Background: Chinese Americans are the largest Asian subgroup in the U.S., and many are recent immigrants with high rates of cancer, a leading cause of death for this population. Although Chinese American patients frequently present with advanced illness and poorly controlled pain, information on symptom burden in this population is very limited. As part of an ongoing community study to test the effectiveness of a rapid-cycle quality improvement (QI) intervention to enhance symptom management, we evaluated the prevalence and burden of cancer symptoms in a large sample of first-generation, non-English speaking, ethnic Chinese patients. Method(s): A consecutive sample of Chinese American patients in two large community-based oncology practices and one hospital-based practice in New York were screened for cancer symptoms. Eligible adults who self-identified as ethnic Chinese, spoke Cantonese or Mandarin as their primary language, and had a history of cancer completed translated instruments assessing symptom prevalence, severity, and distress administered by bilingual research assistants. The study was approved by the IRB at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Result(s): Of 1,018 cancer patients screened to date (62.2\% women; M age = 64.0 years (SD = 13.7, range = 23 to 101); 20.6\% reported persistent cancer pain for the past month. The most common cancers were breast (34.3\%) lung (12.6\%), and head and neck (11.8\%) and 41.9\% were undergoing active treatment. The mean worst pain intensity on a 0-10 numeric scale was 5.5 (SD = 2.2), with 34.4\% rating their worst pain as {\textgreater} 6 of 10. Many (84.5\%) reported other symptoms, including fatigue (54.4\%), dry mouth (52.4\%), difficulty sleeping (44.8\%), and drowsiness (37.5\%). Overall, 32.7\% rated their symptoms as "quite a bit" or "very much" distressing, with sleep disturbance (33.1\%), lack of appetite (31.3\%), and constipation (29.2\%) causing the most severe distress. Conclusion(s): Symptom burden is high among community-dwelling, economically-disadvantaged ethnic Chinese cancer patients. Our ongoing QI intervention may alleviate the high symptom rate in this population and clarify potential patient, provider, and system-related factors that are associated with symptom control outcomes.},

The Management Interventions for Asthma project (MIA) assessed the feasibility of involving adults, parents and children from this potentially 'hard to reach' ethnic community alongside healthcare professionals (HCPs) in prioritising components for tailored asthma interventions. Methods Eleven issues identified as barriers to asthma management following interviews with community members, parents, children and HCPs were presented at community based events by the MIA team utilising interpreters/facilitators for simultaneous 5-way translation. HCPs were sent information electronically. Forty six community members, 22 parents, 19 children and 13 HCPs used Borda ranking to prioritise the issues for subsequent development of interventions in the current health care system. Results Getting a diagnosis was ranked first by parents and community members but last by HCPs. Language barriers were ranked first by HCPs. Children prioritised managing acute asthma attacks. Conclusions Ethnicity and language need not be barriers to involving South Asian families in health services research. It is crucial to include community members, families and children in the development of tailored interventions as well as HCPs. Relying on HCPs alone could lead to key issues being missed or priorities misjudged.},

	abstract = {Background: The issue of domestic violence (DV) in the Australian Community is one of significant concern. and the Indian community of Victoria, Australia is no exception. One in three women suffer DV and there appears to be a distinct lack of culturally sensitive data to guide current domestic violence services. Further, DV is an eminently preventable cause of many mental illnesses, including high suicide rates and psychosomatic illnesses. This social qualitative study sought to gather culturally sensitive data to guide services and prevention strategies campaigns in the Victorian Indian Population. Indian is a collectivist society, commonly employs defence mechanisms such as denial, avoidance, shame, fear of social opprobrium, need for conformity, making it a taboo to speak freely about issues such as DV. To by-pass cultural defence mechanism, we decided to use modified Forum Theatre under the direction of a theatre director. Method(s): Women from Indian populated areas in Melbourne took part in this community-action research. Phase 1 - 3 Focus groups discussions. Phase 2-Script was created from themes of focus group discussions. Phase 3 - Women volunteered as actors for modified Forum Theatre (Boal 2004, Sleip 2004). Phase 4 - Enacted with interactive audience participation. All key conversations were audio recorded and anlysed with qualitative statistical tools. Result(s): 70 women took part in Focus group discussions. A further 120-130 women took part in four theater productions. Rich data regarding social drivers of DV in Australian Indian homes, silence on the topic, taboos and barriers to using DV services obtained. Conclusion(s): Modified Forum Theater yielded useful new data to guide treatment and prevention strategies for DV in Australian Indian population. The findings of this study can be generalized to some extent to other collectivist societies.},

	abstract = {Background: Heart Failure is a complex syndrome with numerous patho-physiological mechanisms and altered biomarker profiles. Biomarkers that indicate risk for incident HF are less well established. Objective(s): To evaluate the predictive role of biomarkers reflecting different patho-physiological pathways for prediction of HF in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large multi-ethnic community based cohort. Method(s): We evaluated 6,814 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese participants with mean age 62.3 +/- 10.3 (51.4\% female). We examined individual and joint associations of CRP, fibrinogen, NT-proBNP, homocysteine, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) with incident HF using Cox proportional-hazard models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, systolic BP, antihypertensive therapy, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, BMI, left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated per 1-SD change in log (biomarker). A multivariable-adjusted stepwise procedure (p for retention {\textless} 0.05) was used to determine the independent contributions of the biomarkers for prediction of HF. We examined the increased model discriminative value with calculation of the C-statistic. Net reclassification index (NRI) was calculated with participants stratified in 3 risk categories; low (10\%). Result(s): During median follow-up of 7.6 years, 176 participants developed HF. In multivariable-adjusted models, 3 of 5 biomarkers were individually associated with HF; NT-proBNP, CRP, and UACR [HRs: 2.46, (95\% CI 2.11-2.87), 1.28 (1.09-1.50), and 1.29 (1.14-1.45), respectively]. After stepwise selection only NT-proBNP [HR: 2.56 (95\% CI 2.17-3.03)] and CRP [HR: 1.20 (95\% CI 1.03-1.41)] remained statistically significant. The C-statistic significantly increased when NT-proBNP and CRP were added to the model (0.864 vs. 0.808). The addition of biomarkers improved NRI (NRI 0.29, p {\textless}0.0001). Conclusion(s): CRP and NT-proBNP are significant independent predictors and substantially improve risk classification for incident heart failure. More research is warranted to determine the clinical utility of measuring these biomarkers in subjects at risk for incident heart failure.},

	abstract = {Background: There is evidence that low socio-economic status (SES) of mothers correlates with later language and social communication outcomes of their children. This longitudinal project aims to determine whether individual differences in eye movement patterns at 6-7 months of age can predict language and social communication outcomes at 2 years of age. An eye-tracker was set up in Children's Centres in two East London boroughs with high socio-economic deprivation, where early language and social difficulties are highly prevalent. Method(s): Data collected from almost 200 babies will indicate which eye-tracking tasks, showing dynamic social stimuli, can become reliable early screening tools for babies at risk for later difficulties with language and social communication. The sample of infants was very varied in terms of SES, ethnicity, and spoken languages (e.g., over 40 different languages were spoken as first language). Result(s): We will show results of the Pop-out study, which investigated whether a face preference is elicited in 6-7 month-olds by presenting faces in a complex visual array also containing pictures of other (in)animate objects. Specific individual differences between infants related to family SES, language background, level of caregiver education, and/or housing and childcare arrangements will be discussed. Discussion(s): Despite competing objects, infants have a clear preference for the face, both in terms of overall looking time and first saccade. However, there were also large individual differences in terms of both measures between infants. The correlation between these individual differences and SES measures will be discussed.},

Participants completed English and Spanish versions of the Sleep Habits Questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans II one week apart in randomized order. Psychometric properties were assessed, including internal consistency, convergent validity, scale equivalence, language version intercorrelations, and exploratory factor analysis using PASW (Version18) software. Grade level readability of the sleep measure was evaluated. Result(s): All sleep categories (duration, snoring, apnea, insomnia symptoms, other sleep symptoms, sleep disruptors, restless legs syndrome) showed Cronbach alpha, Spearman- Brown coeffi cients and intercorrelations {\textgreater}= 0.700, suggesting robust internal consistency, correlation, and agreement between language versions.

Items loaded on 4 factors accounted for 68\% and 67\% of the variance on the English and Spanish versions, respectively. Conclusion(s): The Spanish-language Sleep Habits Questionnaire demonstrates conceptual and content equivalency. It has appropriate measurement properties and should be useful for assessing sleep health in community-based clinics and intervention studies among Spanish-speaking Mexican Americans. Both language versions showed readability at the fifth grade level. Further testing is needed with larger samples.},

	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Effective rural hygiene and sanitation promotion (RHSP) is a major challenge for many low-income countries. This paper investigates strategies and stakeholders' roles and responsibilities in RHSP implementation in a multi-ethnic area of northern Vietnam, in order to identify lessons learned for future RHSP. A stakeholder analysis was performed, based on 49 semi-structured individual interviews and one group interview with stakeholders in RHSP in a northern province of Vietnam. Participants came from three sectors (agriculture, health and education), unions supported by the Vietnamese government and from four administrative levels (village, commune, district and province). The study villages represented four ethnic minority groups including lowland and highland communities. Stakeholders' roles, responsibilities and promotion methods were outlined, and implementation constraints and opportunities were identified and analysed using thematic content analysis. Effective RHSP in Vietnam is severely constrained despite supporting policies and a multi-sectorial and multi-level framework. Four main barriers for effective implementation of RHSP were identified: (1) weak inter-sectorial collaborations; (2) constraints faced by frontline promoters; (3) almost exclusive information-based and passive promotion methods applied; and (4) context unadjusted promotion strategies across ethnic groups, including a limited focus on socio-economic differences, language barriers and gender roles in the target groups. Highland communities were identified as least targeted and clearly in need of more intensive and effective RHSP. It is recommended that the Vietnamese government gives priority to increasing capacities of and collaboration among stakeholders implementing RHSP activities. This should focus on frontline promoters to perform effective behaviour change communication. It is also recommended to support more participatory and community-based initiatives, which can address the complex socio-economic and cultural determinants of health in multi-ethnic population groups. These lessons learned can improve future RHSP in Vietnam and are also of relevance for health promotion in other minority population groups in the region and globally.},

	abstract = {Objective: To report the processes and outcomes of a case study on digital technology, diabetes and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. Design(s): The qualitative study was based on a literature review, consultations and testing of a framework through workshops and an interactive information session. Setting(s): Consultations, workshops and an information session conducted in western regions of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Method(s): A framework was designed to address the needs of CALD community members to self-manage chronic conditions using innovative digital technology strategies. This was based on the literature review and 20 consultations held with representatives from health service providers and community organizations. The framework was tested with the assistance of the Quang Minh Buddhist Temple through consultations, workshops and an interactive information session about diabetes, YouTube and digital video cameras, in which 38 elderly women from the Vietnamese community participated. A descriptive and thematic analysis of participant feedback was conducted to determine lessons for future practice. Result(s): Participant feedback indicated that the information session achieved its goal of raising awareness of ways to use and access diabetes information using digital technology. However, participants noted areas for enhancement and improvement, including more focused and targeted engagement with peer-led techniques, the digital proficiency of participants and digital technology preferences based on age and cultural background. Conclusion(s): Digital technology was used to improve diabetes awareness information with elderly Vietnamese women, demonstrating the potential for application with others from CALD communities. However, there are continuing challenges in this approach, indicating the need for nuanced community engagement strategies that consider cultural context and familiarity with different kinds of digital technology.

Method(s): Fifteen obese Latino adolescents (body mass index [BMI] percentile = 96.3 +/- 1.1, age = 15.0 +/- 0.9 years) completed a 12-week intervention that included weekly lifestyle education classes delivered by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 60-minute physical activity sessions per week. Participants were assessed for anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI, and waist circumference), cardiorespiratory fitness, physical activity/inactivity, nutrition behaviors, and insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Result(s): The intervention resulted in significant decreases in BMI z score, BMI percentile, and waist circumference; increases in cardiorespiratory fitness; and decreases in physical inactivity and dietary fat consumption. In addition to these changes, the intervention led to significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and reductions in 2-hour glucose levels. Conclusion(s): These results support the feasibility and efficacy of a community-based diabetes prevention program for high-risk Latino youth.

Interviews were conducted with 600 Palestinian and 901 Israeli (Jewish and Arab) children (ages 8, 11, and 14) and their parents once a year for 3 consecutive years. Palestinian children, males, and older youth were generally at greatest risk for exposure to conflict/violence across contexts. Regression analysis found unique effects of exposure to ethnic-political (Palestinian sample), school (Palestinian and Israeli Jewish samples), and family conflict/violence (Israeli Arab sample) during the first 2 years on PTS symptoms in Year 3, controlling for prior PTS symptoms. Cumulative exposure to violence in more contexts during the first 2 years predicted higher subsequent PTS symptoms than did exposure to violence in fewer contexts, and this was true regardless of the youth's level of prior PTS symptoms. These results highlight the risk that ongoing exposure to violence across multiple contexts in the social ecology poses for the mental health of children in contexts of ethnic-political violence. Researchers and mental health professionals working with war-exposed youth in a given cultural context must assess both war- and non-war-related stressors affecting youth. Based on this assessment, interventions may not be limited to individual-based, war-trauma-focused approaches but also may include school-based, community-based, and family-level interventions.

Nearly half reported health as fair/poor, and 22\% had a chronic health condition. This community survey illuminates the need to profile the health care needs of these immigrant populations.

	abstract = {Objective: Effective behavioral diabetes interventions for Mexican Americans are needed. Our study focused on efforts to recruit Mexican American adults for a trial testing a diabetes community health worker (CHW) self-management intervention. Design(s): Behavioral randomized controlled trial, community-based participatory research approach. Setting(s): Chicago. Participant(s): Mexican American adults with type 2 diabetes. Outcome Measures: Screening and randomization. Method(s): Initial eligibility criteria included Mexican heritage, treatment with oral diabetes medication, residence in designated zip codes, planned residence in the area for two years, and enrollment in a specific insurance plan. Result(s): Recruitment through the insurer resulted in only one randomized participant. Eligibility criteria were relaxed and subsequent efforts included bilingual advertisements, presentations at churches and community events, postings in clinics, partnerships with community providers, and CHW outreach. Zip codes were expanded multiple times and insurance criteria removed. CHW outreach resulted in 53\% of randomized participants. Conclusion(s): Despite strong ties with the target community, culturally appropriate recruitment strategies involving community representation, and a large pool of potential participants, significant challenges were encountered in recruitment for this diabetes intervention trial. Researchers identified three key barriers to participation: study intensity and duration, lack of financial incentives, and challenges in establishing trust. For future research to be successful, investigators need to recognize these barriers, offer adequate incentives to compensate for intervention intensity, and establish strong trust through community partnerships and the incorporation of community members in the recruitment process.},

	doi = {10.1093/pubmed/fdq100},
	abstract = {Background We sought to understand the barriers and facilitators to participation in research from the perspectives of South Asian people with asthma. Methods Eight focus groups were conducted in the preferred language of participants. Sampling was purposeful to ensure inclusion of males and females from differing ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds. Results The forming of trusting relationships was described as pivotal to the successful recruitment of minority ethnic groups into research; personalized approaches were likely to be better received than more impersonal written approaches. Notable barriers to participation included: the stigma of being labelled with asthma; concerns surrounding participation in pharmaceutical trials; major time or travel commitments and a failure to show respect by not making information available in minority ethnic languages. Flexibility, in terms of timing, location and respecting of cultural and religious sensitivities around gender segregation, together with the offer of incentives, were highlighted as key factors to promote participation. Conclusions The barriers to recruitment are largely surmountable, but these will necessitate the use of resource intensive and more personalized approaches than are commonly employed for the White European origin population. Our proposed model to enhance recruitment is likely to have transferability beyond the field of asthma. Â© The Author 2011, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

	abstract = {Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Australia experience both significant health disparities and a lack of access to services. Consequently, there have been calls for culturally appropriate services for people with chronic disease in CALD populations. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent chronic disease in CALD communities. Evidence was sought from randomized controlled trials and controlled studies that examined strategies for promoting cultural competence in health service delivery to CALD communities. The outcomes examined included changes in consumer health behaviours, utilisation/satisfaction with the service, and the cultural competence of health-care providers. Of the 202 studies that were identified only 24 met the inclusion criteria. The five categories of intervention that were identified included: (1) the use of community-based bi-lingual health workers; (2) providing cultural competency training for health workers; (3) using interpreter service for CALD people; (4) using multimedia and culturally sensitive videos to promote health for CALD people and (5) establishing community point-of-care services for CALD people with chronic disease. The review supported the use of trained bi-lingual health workers, who are culturally competent, as a major consideration in the development of an appropriate health service model for CALD communities.

	abstract = {Given an Australian national and state policy agenda that continues to promote collaborative work, many community organisations are attempting to engage in partnerships with mixed results. This paper reports on a qualitative study conducted to explore the experiences of existing partnerships between organisations and small community groups who deliver community based support services to older people from culturally diverse backgrounds. In particular, this study sought to identify the key factors that facilitate and hinder the formation, maintenance and effectiveness of partnerships within the ethnic and multicultural community aged care (EMCAC) sector. Fourteen participants representing nine community and health service organisations located in the Melbourne metropolitan area took part in semi-structured interviews. Participants reported that partnerships between organisations are necessary and beneficial within the EMCAC sector. Organisational capacity, access to information and guidelines, and the inequality experienced by smaller organisations were key issues identified by participants. Increasing organisational capacity and reducing the inequalities experienced in partnerships may be addressed via training and education about the nature of partnerships, as well as by advocating for increased resources to smaller ethno-specific organisations. Further investigation is required to examine whether not engaging in partnerships will deem an organisation unsustainable in the longer term. Â© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This article adds to literature, describing how this is operationalised in health promotion research. The operationalisation of participation and equality in a participatory action research (PAR) project examining domestic violence in five communities from an African refugee background, post settlement in Perth (Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan) is described. The qualitative research undertaken included 78 participants: 54 from the five communities and 24 from health and support agency staff who provide services to them and utilised in-depth interviews and focus groups. Ongoing participation by community members and equality within stakeholder relationships was facilitated by the project being community-initiated, the crystallisation of strong stakeholder relationships, data collection by trained bicultural, bilingual interviewers from the five communities, and ongoing involvement of the communities through data analysis and report-writing phases. All stakeholders are able to learn from the perspectives and knowledge of others. Equality can supplant a subject-object relationship typical of much research and evident in some practice, with a subject-subject relationship. It can also transpose community members from the margins to the centre of research and practice. How community strength and capacity can be built through research is instructive for health promotion practice.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Community Based Medical Education (CBME) clinical staff have seen increasing numbers of patients without English fluency, increasing UK medical student numbers1 and the increase in community placements. This has resulted in more students observing non-English language community-based consultations. Anecdotally, negative comments have been raised by students regarding this potentially rich learning environment. Data was gathered to explore the students' opinions of non-English language consultations. Methodology: Comments regarding community learning experiences were gathered from year three and four students using mixed methods. Data was themed using a grounded theory approach. Result(s): Students' perceptions of non-English language consultations were frequently negative. They suggested that little learning was possible in this environment and the overall experience was viewed poorly. Students enjoyed talking to patients but this was much harder if they had no shared language. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Implications of students' perceptions of medical interactions with patients who do not speak English are important in a globally mobile population. Concepts such as cultural competency, professionalism,2 and patient centredness3 may be lost without addressing this issue. Students may miss the opportunity to learn how serve the full range of their patient population in their future careers. Future work is required by university and community tutors to maximise the potential learning from this rich environment to effectively translate into a useful experience for students.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The Children's RESPIRA Education Program (RESPIRA) is a project initiated in 2006 that promotes equitable healthcare for asthmatic children. RESPIRA empowers Latino families to become proactive, educated and in control of managing their child's asthma. Our program provides bilingual asthma education in Spanish/English followed by home visits and quality of life survey which each family receives upon completion of the program. The goal is to reduce ED visits and hospitalizations by empowering these families to improve their quality of life by changing behavior patterns. We achieved this by developing and utilizing this best practice medical education model which assist the underserved families in NJ. Method(s): Our project provides comprehensive bilingual medical and education services to Latino families in 8 NJ counties through schools, daycare centers, community and faith based organizations. We service families with asthmatic children from 6 months to 21 years of age. The program educates both parents and children. The parents are educated by a bilingual health educator while the children are taught by a bilingual public health representative. The bilingual presentation covers pathogenesis, triggers and treatment of asthma. Home and folk remedies, an integral part of the Latino culture are also discussed. Pre and post -test are given to parents and children to assess changes in asthma knowledge as are standardized age appropriate asthma control test. Three weeks after completion of the education program, an initial home visit is conducted by the health educator and public health representative to re-enforce asthma education, assess environmental triggers at home, review the child's action plan and provide guidance to school service agencies if needed. Six to eight weeks later a follow-up visit is made. A quality of life survey is done for families who complete the program with their consent to determine if there has been a decrease in hospitalizations or ED visits. Result(s): By January 2010, 540 families and 655 children have been enrolled with quality of life survey results for 109 families. After completion of the program ED visits were reduced by 19.3\% and hospital admission by 8.3\%. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): The RESPIRA program has succeeded in decreasing both ED visits and hospitalizations within those families completing the quality of life survey. We anticipate significant cost savings which are still in the process of being analyzed. By providing comprehensive medical -educational services to Latino families with asthmatic children, we have improved their quality of life.},

We need to design culturally and linguistically appropriate health education interventions as existing information materials on asthma for different cultural and language communities are not geared toward these ethno-cultural groups in Canada. Objective(s): Our study was a community-based participatory research project which aimed to assess immigrants' knowledge on asthma within Chinese and Punjabi communities living in BC, Canada. Method(s): A series of "knowledge" and "community" videos and "pictorial pamphlets" were created from group activities and shared information by key-informants, community members, and the research team. The Community videos were role played by asthma patients and their families. The knowledge videos were developed by two physicians from each of the involved communities. The videos were developed in Mandarin, Cantonese and Punjabi, with English subtitles. The pamphlets were prepared in the community languages and English. The participants were assigned at random to one of four groups: Group1 viewed the knowledge video, Group2 viewed the community video, Group3 viewed both videos, and Group4 read the printed educational pamphlet only. Result(s): 81 adults with physician-diagnosed asthma (40 Chinese and 41 Punjabi aged 19 to 78 including 39 male and 42 female; from which 21 spoke Cantonese, 19 Mandarin, and 41 Punjabi) participated in the study. Preliminary analyses showed patients' overall knowledge about asthma causes and triggers was improved significantly from pretest to follow-up post-test in all language groups. However, no significant differences were identified among intervention groups. Patients reported their intention to properly manage their asthma, following participation in this study. The areas of involvement, as reported by more than 64\% of the participants, were: "following doctor's instruction to manage asthma", "how to avoid asthma triggers", and "take medication properly and regularly". Major reasons for understanding and following the information provided in the education materials, as reported by over 65\% of the participants, were that information was in their own language and provided by people from their own community. Conclusion(s): We highlight the importance of patients understanding information and their adherence with physician instruction to manage their asthma while receiving education that is culturally and linguistically relevant. The implications of these findings are important when taking into consideration that "language and cultural discordance" between health care provider and patient has been shown by several researchers to be associated with lower patient compliance and poor health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Biospecimen donation and banking from diverse populations are critical for translational cancer research. Yet, little is known about community members' perceptions about biospecimen donation and banking. The objectives of this study are to develop instruments to examine perceptions of biospecimen donation and banking and evaluate the efficacy of biobanking educational materials. Method(s): Guided by a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, the study consists of two phases. In phase I, an instrument named Biobanking Attitudes and Knowledge Survey (BANKS) was developed in collaboration with the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN) Biobanking Community Advisory Board to assess participants' knowledge about and attitudes towards biospecimen collection, intention to donate biospecimens to a biobank, as well as self-efficacy regarding biospecimen donation. BANKS development and validation consists of iterative processes, including content analysis of 12 focus groups (n=95) for item generation; cognitive interviews (n=12 community members) to assess item comprehension and language appropriateness; content validity analyses with biobanking experts (n=5) to evaluate item relevancy to the constructs of interest (Knowledge, Attitudes and Self-efficacy); pilot-testing with community members; and instrument translation into Spanish. In Phase II, a small randomized control trial will be conducted with 60 community members to assess the efficacy of biobanking educational materials in increasing knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to donate biospecimens to a biobank. The study will compare a multimedia biobanking educational intervention developed by TBCCN, with the National Cancer Institute brochure titled Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need to Know (NCI brochure). BANKS data will be collected following study enrollment (baseline), and then participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups (TBCCN multimedia intervention or NCI brochure). Follow-up interviews using the BANKS will be conducted between 7 and 14 days after enrollment. Participants' medical records will be reviewed to assess group differences in biospecimen donation consent rates. Result(s): Using a CBPR approach, the project has successfully developed and validated a culturally and linguistically appropriate instrument to assess community members' knowledge, attitudes, intention, and self-efficacy related to biospecimen donation. The BANKS is comprised of 21 attitudes items, 17 knowledge items, 11 self-efficacy items, and 2 intention items. Phase II of the study is expected to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of a multimedia biobanking educational intervention in improving perceptions of biospecimen donation and biobanking. Conclusion(s): Using a CBPR approach, data collected during this study have yielded a culturally appropriate instrument to assess community members' perceptions about biobanking, the BANKS. The next step in the study is to use the BANKS to evaluate a multimedia biobanking intervention in increasing knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and intention to donate biospecimens to a biobank among racial/ethnically and linguistically diverse populations in Tampa Bay, Florida.},

	abstract = {As health disparities continue to plague our nation it is imperative that we find ways to reduce and eliminate this public health issue. Further, as Latinos have become the largest minority group in the United States, we must address disparities in breast and cervical cancer screening rates as well as find ways to successful reduce disparities in cancer survival. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among Latinas; often diagnosed at advanced stages. The incidence rates for cervical cancer are higher than non-Latina white women. Latinas have faced many difficulties within the medical care system, including accessing health services. Patient navigation has become increasingly common as a way to increase adherence to treatment and more recently, as a method of increasing cancer screening. Esperanza y Vida was developed as an intervention to reach groups of women from diverse Latino backgrounds, as a culturally and linguistically appropriate approach to cancer education and screening. Following the educational component of the program, women were contacted 2-months later to determine their age-specific screening adherence status (mammography, clinical breast exam and/or Pap test). Women who were still non-adherent to screening were offered navigational assistance. Navigational services included assistance in locating bilingual services as well as free and/or low cost screening programs, logistical assistance, encouragement for screening and additional education about the importance of screening. All women were again contacted 8 months post the educational program. This presentation will focus on the outcomes following navigation. The sample included women who were reached for both the 2- and 8-month follow up assessments and received navigational services. We will demonstrate the success of navigation; of women who were non-adherent to mammography, 63\% became adherent. Univariate predictors include where the programs were conducted (Arkansas, New York City and Western NY) and concurrent screening. For clinical breast exams, 61\% of non-adherent women became adherent with significant predictors of program location, years living in the US, conducting breast self exams, and concurrent other screening. For Pap test, 59\% of the women became adherent with significant predictors of program location, marital status, current screening and not being afraid of hear the results of medical exams. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of each screening test included adherence to the other screening exams, at the same time point. This is very encouraging, in that it appears that once we can connect women with clinical services, they are able to access other exams. Next steps include understanding why 40\% of women still remained unscreened.},

	abstract = {Obesity and insulin resistance disproportionately impact Latino youth who experience one of the highest lifetime risks for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Few diabetes prevention programs have addressed "upstream" factors related to T2D, nor the specific culturally relevant lifestyle needs of overweight Latino youth. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a culturally informed, community-based diabetes prevention program for overweight Latino adolescents on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Overweight Latino adolescents (n=18, BMI\%=96.2+/-4.1, age 15.2+/-1.0 yrs) were invited to participate in a 12-week lifestyle education program developed through a partnership between a community health clinic, an academic institution, and a local YMCA. Weekly group nutrition and lifestyle education classes were delivered to families by bilingual/bicultural promotoras and three, 1-hr moderate to vigorous exercise sessions per week were held for youth. The program was designed to improve health by empowering youth and their families to make healthy lifestyle choices as well as empower community agencies to collaboratively facilitate these choices. A multi-sample 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test with 30 minute sampling for insulin and glucose was used to assess T2D risk before and after the program. Fifteen youth (7 boys / 8 girls) completed the program and attended 91\% of the education and physical activity sessions where mean heart rate was 146 +/- 21 BPM. Compared to baseline, insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index) increased by 33.1\% from 2.4 +/- 1.3 to 3.1 +/- 1.4; p=0.01, 2-hour post-challenge glucose decreased by 9.2\% from 117.2 +/- 4.8 to 104.5 +/- 2.7 mg/dl; p{\textless}0.01, and 2-hr post-challenge insulin decreased by 37.6\% from 161.2 +/- 21.3 to 88.8 +/- 16.7 muIU/ml; p=0.001. No significant changes were noted for fasting glucose or insulin. The improvements in insulin sensitivity and 2-hr glucose measures following the lifestyle intervention indicate a potential reduction in T2D risk among this high-risk population. Communitybased efforts are needed to close the diabetes-related health disparities gap and collaborative partnerships may prove most effective for reaching high-risk youth.},

Results showed increased number of exercise activities [3.1 to 3.6 to 3.8, F(2, 72) = 3.31, p {\textless} .05] and feet checks [1.7 to 2.8 to 3.1, F(2, 78) = 12.30, p {\textless} .001] per week at each successive assessment. Participants' mean waist circumference decreased [38.5 to 37.4, F(1, 39) = 22.58, p {\textless} .001], mean levels of high-density lipoprotein increased [44.0 to 48.7, F(1, 35) = 12.38, p {\textless} .01], and mean levels of Hemoglobin A1C decreased [7.29 to 6.76, F(1, 38) = 26.58, p {\textless} .001] from the baseline to the 3-month follow-up assessments. Although differences in mean levels of diabetes knowledge and self-care efficacy across assessments did not reach statistical significance, the means were in the predicted direction, suggesting that significant differences may emerge in a larger study with more participants. Most participants reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the culturally tailored diabetes education (88.7\%) program. Almost all participants (96.2\%) indicated that they would recommend the program to a friend. CBDSMP may be an effective approach to improving diabetes outcomes in Korean and potentially other underserved ethnic minority immigrants who have limited access to clinicbased programs. The program is favorably received by patients with DM.},

	title = {Peer-support in the management of diabetes in the urban {American} {Indian} population of {Seattle}, {Washington}},
	volume = {59},
	abstract = {Purpose of Study: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus amongst American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults is estimated to be 16.5\%, the highest of any ethnic group worldwide. The Seattle Indian Health Board (SIHB) is one of 34 urban affiliates of the Indian Health Service (IHS) serving 7203 patients, 18.1\% of whom are diabetic. The purpose of this project was to improve the quality of care for the diabetic patient population served by the SIHB by addressing the need for low cost and culturally relevant diabetes education and management. Methods Used: Consultation with the SIHB agencies helped in recognizing the diabetic population as an appropriate target for a community-based intervention. Discussions with providers, patients, and community elders were critical in revealing areas of universal misunderstanding about diabetes. Research was conducted to produce a comprehensive list of accurate, relevant, and cost-free resources for diabetes information and support. An informational handout addressing diabetes myths common to the AI/AN community were generated for SIHB patients. A survey was developed in order to quantify interest of diabetic patients in becoming peer-support educators. Groundwork was laid to establish a longitudinal program for peersupport and diabetes counseling. Summary of Results: A round-table discussion including 13 diabetic patients, three members of the diabetes team, and one physician was successfully facilitated. All feedback regarding the session and the informational handout was positive. Providers, staff, and community elders all agreed that peer-support and mentoring is a culturally appropriate and effective method for low cost diabetes prevention. Collaboration between the SIHB diabetes team and key AI/AN community members was established in order to move forward with the development of a peer-support training program. Conclusion(s): Culturally relevant methods are critical to the successful prevention and management of chronic illness. Implementation of peer-support has been shown to be an effective method of raising awareness and compliance in various ethnic communities, both rural and urban. Although it is a relatively new approach in the treatment of diabetes, peer-education promises to be a useful tool in the promotion of education and trust in the AI/AN diabetic population.},

There exists a significant disparity in HIV/AIDS rates among Aboriginals when compared to non-Aboriginals; this reality, along with the growing percentage of HIV reports and AIDS cases in Aboriginal communities, necessitates examination of the gaps, barriers, and needs related to this specific population. Stories collected indicate that there are significant barriers to culturally competent health services for Aboriginals. Lack of information and a common cross-generational language to discuss HIV/AIDS were significant barriers. Gender issues, stigmas and misinformation surrounding HIV/ AIDS were also prominent. Building on a process of cultural revitalization and continued decolonialization as well as programming to develop culturally competent health services are key strengths that can be used to address this health issue.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about how migrants adapt to first-world public health systems. In Norway, patients are assigned a registered general practitioner (RGP) to provide basic care and serve as gatekeeper for other medical services. Objective(s): To explore determinants of migrant compliance with the RGP scheme and obstacles that migrants may experience. Method(s): Individuals in leadership positions within migrant organizations for the 13 largest migrant populations in Norway in 2008 participated in this qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews, with migrants serving as key informants, were used to elucidate possible challenges migrant patients face in navigating the local primary health-care system. Conversations were structured using an interview guide covering the range of challenges that migrant patients meet in the health-care system. Result(s): According to informants, integration into the RGP scheme and adequacy of patient-physician communication varies according to duration of stay in Norway, the patient's country of origin, the reason for migration, health literacy, intention to establish permanent residence in Norway, language proficiency, and comprehension of information received about the health system. Informants noted as obstacles: doctor-patient interaction patterns, conflicting ideas about the role of the doctor, and language and cultural differences. In addressing noted obstacles, one strategy would be to combine direct intervention by migrant associations with indirect intervention via the public-health system. Conclusion(s): Our results will augment the interpretation of forthcoming quantitative data on migrant integration into the public-health system and shed light on particular obstacles.

	volume = {17},

	abstract = {With 28\% of Australia's population having a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background, the health system faces an increasing challenge to provide accessible and culturally competent health care. The view that all CALD communities are homogenous and solutions can be developed for the entire nation is detrimental. Despite available health services, CALD communities are reluctant to use them due to cultural differences, perceived racism and misunderstandings leading to the existing health disparities. Therefore, gathering data from four prominent CALD communities, such as the Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese communities in Logan, Queensland, about how they perceive and use health services can provide insightful information towards development of a service model that will better suit these CALD communities. The objective of the study was to examine the extent to which four prominent CALD communities (Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese) access and use health services in Logan, Queensland. Six focus group interviews using interpreters were conducted in English with Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese people. The results indicated that even long-standing CALD communities, such as the Pacific Islander people, were unfamiliar with health services and experienced difficulties accessing appropriate health care. Most wanted doctors to use traditional healing methods alongside orthodox medicine, but did not feel respected for their beliefs. Language difficulties impeded communication with health professionals who were hindered by ineffective use of interpreters. In conclusion, a clear role for bilingual community-based navigators was identified by CALD participants to address concerns about the health system, and to improve accessibility and health service usage.

	abstract = {Background. Little is known about cancer pain in Chinese Americans. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of pain in this population. This information is needed to identify and address unmet clinical needs for culturally relevant interventions targeting pain and its consequences. Methods. A consecutive sample of underserved ethnic Chinese patients in a large community-based oncology practice was screened for persistent or frequent pain. Those patients with pain completed translated instruments assessing demographics, linguistic acculturation, disease-related characteristics, and pain-related characteristics. Results. Of 312 patients screened, 178 (57.1\%) reported frequent or persistent pain, 175 were eligible, and 170 participated. Most participants (85.9\%) were born in China and 84.7\% overall spoke Cantonese only. The most common cancers were gastrointestinal (28.2\%), lung (21.8\%), breast (20.6\%), head and neck (12.9\%), and genitourinary (4.7\%); 43.5\% had metastatic disease. The mean worst pain severity on a 0-10 numeric scale was 4.7 (standard deviation, 2.4), with 28.2\% of patients rating their worst pain at{\textgreater}7 of 10. Although 37.6\% used opioids and 47.1\% used nonopioids, 45.8\% reported "little" or "no" pain relief from medications. Complementary or alternative medicine therapies for cancer pain were used by 35.8\%. In multiple regression analyses, worst pain was positively associated with acculturation to the English language and opioid therapy, and pain-related distress was positively associated with opioid therapy. Conclusion. Pain is prevalent among community dwelling, ethnic Chinese American cancer patients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and investigate the finding that higher linguistic acculturation is associated with reports of more intense pain.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This qualitative study assessed the needs of patients and caregivers during the transition from hospital to home. We specifically identified unmet needs of ethnic minorities, recent immigrants, and seniors with limited English proficiency (LEP). Findings are translated into recommendations for improving services to these groups during health care transitions. Design and Methods: This needs assessment included extensive analysis of qualitative data collected from 20 language-, culture-, and ethnic-specific focus groups with caregivers who recently assisted a senior after a hospital discharge. Findings from these focus groups were supplemented by 5 in-depth, longitudinal case studies of recently hospitalized seniors and their caregivers. Result(s): Inadequate information and training at discharge were themes that spanned all groups, despite ethnicity or language. Additional unmet needs were identified for ethnic minorities, those with LEP, and recent immigrants, including lower levels of social support than might be expected, lack of linguistically appropriate information and services, and cultural and financial barriers to using long-term care services. Implications: As ethnic diversity increases among older Americans, it will become increasingly important to design health care services to meet the needs of diverse groups. Recommendations include assessments of informal care, bilingual information and services, partnerships with community agencies providing culturally competent services, and expansion of home- and community-based services to near-poor seniors.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a culturally tailored comprehensive type 2 diabetes management intervention for Korean American immigrants (KAIs) with type 2 diabetes. Methods A randomized controlled pilot trial with 2 parallel arms (intervention vs control) with a delayed intervention design was used. A total of 79 KAIs, recruited from the Baltimore-Washington area, completed baseline, 18-week, and 30-week follow-ups (intervention, n = 40; control, n = 39). All participants had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1C {\textgreater}=7.5\%) at baseline. The authors' comprehensive, self-help intervention program for type 2 diabetes management (SHIP-DM) consisted of a 6-week structured psychobehavioral education, home glucose monitoring with teletransmission, and bilingual nurse telephone counseling for 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was A1C level, and secondary outcomes included an array of psychobehavioral variables. Results Using analysis of covariance, the findings support that the proposed intervention was effective in significantly lowering A1C and fasting glucose and also in improving psychosocial outcomes in the sample. Specifically, the amount of reduction in A1C among intervention group participants was 1.19\% at 18 weeks and 1.31\% at 30 weeks, with 10\% and 15.5\% of the participants achieving the suggested goal of A1C {\textless}7\% at 18 and 30 weeks of follow-up, respectively. Conclusions The results highlight the clinical efficacy of the SHIP-DM intervention composed of a 6-week education program, self-monitoring, and follow-up counseling, in terms of maintaining the improved intervention effects obtained and in terms of glucose control.

"Neighborhood STRENGTH", our community-based participatory research (CBPR) project, comprised four partners: a youth center; an environmental non-profit; a community-based health center; and a university. Unlike most CBPR projects that are single topic-focused, our 'holistic', systems-based project targeted five priorities. The three research-focused/action-oriented components were: (1) participatory monitoring of indoor and outdoor pollution; (2) learning about health needs and concerns of residents through community-based listening sessions; (3) engaging in collaborative survey work, including a household vulnerability survey and an asthma prevalence survey for schoolchildren. The two action-focused/research-informed components were: (4) tackling persistent street trash and illegal dumping strategically; and (5) educating and empowering youth to promote environmental justice. We used a coupled CBPR-capacity building approach to design, vulnerability theory to frame, and mixed methods: quantitative environmental testing and qualitative surveys. Process and outcomes yielded important lessons: vulnerability theory helps frame issues holistically; having several topic-based projects yielded useful information, but was hard to manage and articulate to the public; access to, and engagement with, the target population was very difficult and would have benefited greatly from having representative residents who were paid at the partners' table. Engagement with residents and conflict burden varied highly across components. Notwithstanding, we built enabling capacity, strengthened our understanding of vulnerability, and are able to share valuable experiential knowledge.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Support of organ donation among Asian Americans has been limited, but lack of access to information and prevalence of misinformation are 2 barriers that might be counteracted by public education. OBJECTIVE(S): To solicit advice from 4 Asian American communities on the design of a culturally appropriate educational campaign on organ donation and transplantation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, multilingual survey administered at community festivals and supermarkets. PARTICIPANTS: 201 Asian American respondents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The components of an effective public education outreach campaign on organ donation were defined for 4 Asian American communities. RESULT(S): Media venues ranked highest for information dissemination on organ donation/transplantation were, in descending order, mainstream television, ethnic newspapers, mainstream newspapers, and ethnic television. Most respondents preferred a spokesperson of Asian American descent, but opinions differed by ethnicity as to whether an effective spokesperson needed to be of the same Asian ethnicity as the respondents. Respondents were further divided by ethnicity on their preference for a locally or nationally well-known spokesperson. The most compelling scenario to promote organ donation was an Asian American waiting for a transplant, followed by an organ donor family or individual, and, last, a transplant recipient. Different advertisements for organ donation appealed to different Asian ethnic groups. CONCLUSION(S): Community-based research gives communities the opportunity to collaborate with health professionals in designing health education programs that target their own populations. Because key aspects influencing campaign efficacy can vary by ethnicity, these important differences need to be taken into account in outreach planning.},

However, the CBPR approach is not without its challenges in Arctic countries such as Greenland, where research capacity, different languages, distance, time and cost become barriers to remaining true to the purest form of CBPR. In this paper, we describe the practical application of CBPR principles and methodologies to a sexual health project investigating sexually transmitted infections in Greenland. We present the initial challenges encountered in the early stages of the pilot CBPR sexual health study, and solutions to these challenges.

	title = {Overcoming language and literacy barriers in safety and health training of agricultural workers},
	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The workforce in all areas of United States agriculture and forestry is becoming increasingly diverse in language, culture, and education. Many agricultural workers are immigrants who have limited English language skills and limited educational attainment. Providing safety and health training to this large, diverse, dispersed, and often transient population of workers is challenging. This review, prepared for the 2010 Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conference, "Be Safe, Be Profitable: Protecting Workers in Agriculture," is divided into five sections. First, we describe the occupational and demographic characteristics of agricultural workers in the United States to highlight their safety and health training needs. Second, we summarize current research on the social and cultural attributes of agricultural workers and agricultural employers that affect the provision of safety and health training. Worker and employer attributes include language, literacy, financial limitations, work beliefs, and health beliefs. Third, we review current initiatives addressing safety and health training for agricultural workers that consider worker language and literacy. These initiatives are limited to a few specific topics (e.g., pesticides, heat stress); they do not provide general programs of safety training that would help establish a culture of workplace safety. However, several innovative approaches to health and safety training are being implemented, including the use of community-based participatory approaches and lay health promoter programs. Fourth, the limited industry response for safety training with this linguistically diverse and educationally limited workforce is summarized. Finally, gaps in knowledge and practice are summarized and recommendations to develop educationally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate safety and health training are presented.},

	volume = {100},
	abstract = {Objectives: According to recent census data, 1,216,600 Canadians are of Chinese descent, and over 80\% of Chinese Canadians are foreign born. Approximately 10\% of Chinese immigrants are chronic carriers of hepatitis B, compared with less than 0.5\% of the general population. English as a second language (ESL) classes provide ready access for individuals with limited English proficiency who are not reached by English language health education materials and media campaigns. We conducted a group-randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a hepatitis B ESL educational curriculum for Chinese immigrants. Method(s): Five community-based organizations that provide ESL education in the greater Vancouver area participated in the study. Forty-one ESL classes (which included 325 Chinese students) were randomly assigned to experimental or control status. A follow-up survey, conducted six months after randomization, assessed knowledge about hepatitis B. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the data. Result(s): Follow-up surveys were completed by 298 (92\%) of the students. At follow-up, experimental group students were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) more likely than control group students to know that immigrants have higher hepatitis B infection rates than people who were born in Canada; hepatitis B can be spread during childbirth, during sexual intercourse and by sharing razors; hepatitis B is not spread by sharing eating utensils; and hepatitis B infection can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that ESL curricula can have a positive impact on health knowledge among Chinese immigrants with limited English. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of ESL curricula for other immigrant groups, as well as other health topics. Â© Canadian Public Health Association, 2009. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1177/0145721710386973},
	abstract = {Purpose Community-based diabetes screening is common, but its impact on health outcomes is unclear. Screening protocols may not be standardized nor reflect current clinical practice. A community and clinical team examined the quality and consistency of community-based screening to diagnose hyperglycemic states, and it developed a bilingual screening tool to allow screeners to present accurate, actionable results to participants. Methods The team interviewed providers and community members, analyzed forms and educational materials utilized by screeners, and observed local diabetes screening events. Researchers compared glucose parameters used by screeners to published guidelines and observed finger-stick techniques and protocols for education, referral, and follow-up. Screening was divided into 3 phases: participant assessment before testing, obtainment of a sample, and interpretation of and counsel about results. Results There was a general lack of consistency in diabetes screening practices at the 12 screenings attended and among the 11 screeners interviewed. Assessment rarely included evaluation of diabetes risk factors or recent caloric intake. Obtaining a sample through fingersticks often included practices known to cause discomfort and decrease accuracy of glucose measurements. Criteria used to categorize results as "normal"or "abnormala" rarely followed published guidelines for laboratory-measured glucose values and varied significantly between screeners. No organization mentioned prediabetes in screenings. Postscreening consultation protocols varied widely. Conclusions Inconsistencies and inaccuracies in screening practices may limit the quality and relevance of community-based diabetes screenings. The impact of local screenings may be enhanced by using a tool that includes concrete steps and precise guidelines. Â© 2010 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Rationale: Traffic emissions have been linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. We are initiating a longitudinal epidemiology study of children with asthma living within defined exposure zones around highways in Detroit, Michigan in order to characterize exposure to vehicular exhaust and associated short-term health effects. Objective(s): To design and implement a population-based strategy for recruitment of children with asthma, ages 6-13, living in three exposure zones around highways. Enrollment will include three exposure groups: a) A high traffic/high diesel group living within 150 m of highways with a high volume of truck traffic; b) A high traffic/low diesel group living within 150 m of highways with a low volume of truck traffic; and c) A low traffic/low diesel group living more than 450 m from highways and at least 300 m from major surface roads and whom are from the same neighborhoods as the high traffic groups. Method(s): Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, a partnership of multidisciplinary university faculty, representatives of community-based organizations and the local health department, and local health activists collaboratively developed recruitment tools and designed and implemented the recruitment plan. Result(s): Key elements of the recruitment design include: a) Development and pilot testing of a machine-readable screening questionnaire in three languages to identify children with asthma; b) Selection of a community appropriate incentive plan; c) Employment of bilingual/bicultural local residents as recruitment staff; d) Distribution of screening questionnaires via a two-pronged strategy: first, broad geographical distribution through schools and community-wide events, and second, intensive local campaigns that involved door-to-door canvassing of all residential addresses within the 150 m buffer of designated highway segments; e) Identification of a pool of potentially eligible children by geocoding and mapping addresses from questionnaires meeting screening criteria; f) Selection of a subset of children to be contacted based on geographic clustering; g) Notification to families by mail of potential eligibility followed by a phone call or home visit to provide detailed information about the study and to schedule of an enrollment visit. Efficiencies were achieved by recruiting for two studies simultaneously. As of November 2009, we have processed 3779 screening questionnaires, identified 792 potentially eligible children, selected 150 for contacting, attempted 38 contacts, and successfully consented 22 families. Recruitment is ongoing. Conclusion(s): "High touch" local neighborhood canvassing techniques and "high-tech" geographic information systems methods can be successfully combined to meet challenges recruiting for environmental epidemiology studies.},

	volume = {85},
	doi = {10.1002/ajh.21763},
	abstract = {Background: One of the tenets of cultural competence is that community based organizations who serve the public be constantly aware of, and up-to-date on changing demographics within the community being served. The communication of information on changing demographics to Federal agencies such as HRSA, allows for timely allocation of resources that will enable grantees to meet the needs of emerging populations as they engage in outreach. To that end, during the 2009 funded period, the National Coordinating and Evaluation Center (NCEC) surveyed grantees participating in the Sickle Cell Disease Newborn Screening Program on their experiences and outreach with emerging populations. Method(s): Mixed methods were used to collect data. Grantees participated in telephone interviews conducted from October 2008 - February 2009. The interviews were recorded and later transcribed. In September 2009, grantees submitted written information on populations served and estimates of number of clients served within each group. Grantees also provided summaries of current and proposed activities designed to meet the needs of these clients. Result(s): NCEC grantees provide services to individuals from emerging populations including Latino/Hispanic (111), Asian (36) and African (11) populations. Grantees report a significant number of clients from Haiti and the Virgin Islands, and one grantee reported that they provide services to 23 Cambodian and Montagnard clients. NCEC grantees strive to meet the needs of these clients in a variety of ways including employing bilingual staff, providing interpretation services and translated educational materials, providing case management and social service support or referral, and facilitating population-specific support groups. Spanish was the most common language used by clients from emerging populations. Other languages noted were Portuguese, French, African Tribal dialects, Creole, Vietnamese and Hmong. Projects report a wide range of socio-economic and educational levels. Many needs and assets were identified which include time needed by agencies to learn about other populations and learn how to bridge the cultural gap; utilizing already established agencies or churches within the community to teach about SCD and the services available. Grantees expressed the need for educational materials in languages other than English and for materials written at an even lower literacy level for clients who may not be literate in their own language. Conclusion(s): Grantees are utilizing many and varied methods to serve emerging populations and have been attentive to communicating the changing demographics among the populations that they serve.},

Method(s):AMPis a five year research programme based innorth-west England, involving people with mental health problems from eight under-served groups (minority ethnic communities, asylum-seekers, homeless, unemployed, adolescents, elders, people with advanced cancers or unexplained symptoms) and service providers. In our knowledge generation phase we combined systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis of barriers to access and their solutions, with interviews with stakeholders from under-served groups and care providers. Result(s): Key emergent findings included concepts of silent suffering and embodied suffering, double stigma, the risks of engagement with services, and the cultural insensitivity of existing psychosocial interventions. We refined these findings through a formal consensus process, and have now developed innovative interventions in three inter-linked domains: community engagement, primary care development and sensitized psychosocial interventions.We are testing these interventions in terms of their acceptability and credibility to people from underserved groups, impact on mental health, and service implications. We will devise a focused implementation experiment in two primary care trusts, and disseminate our findings across primary health care.

	abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION: Immigrant communities in the United States have significant barriers to accessing health care and thereby contributing to health disparities. At the same time, groups working to address such disparities inimmigrant communities need to be community responsive but have significant challenges in gathering information to guide interventions. Traditional community based health surveys, usually conducted by departments of health and via telephone, can be problematicwhen gathering information about immigrants since such communities may be "hidden" due to language, logistical, and trust issues. Here we describe a unique process of training communitymembers to become health promoters and laying the groundwork to conduct a community based health needs assessment of a hard to reach community in New York City. Learning Objective 1: To develop a community based needs assessment using community health promoters. Learning Objective 2: Learning Objective 3: Description of Program/Intervention: We formed an academiccommunity partnership, the Westchester Square Partnership to address the health and social needs of the rapidly growing Bangladeshi immigrant community in theBronx.We initially conducted English as Second Language classes at a community health center in a neighborhood where a high percentage of Bangladeshi immigrants reside. Through the English classes, we identified and recruited individuals to become community health promoters (CHP). CHPs underwent weekly training sessions for at least 12 weeks. As part of the training,CHPsconducted a communitymapping project to identify apartment buildings occupied by Bangladeshi residents in the Parkchester and Westchester square neighborhoods of the Bronx (where a large majority of Bangladeshi immigrants in the Bronx reside). CHPs then conducted several rounds of visits to the apartment buildings to introduce Westchester Square Partnership to the community and build trust. Two health fairswere also held in the community to create awareness of programs offered by theWestchester Square Partnership and clinical services available at the community health center. CHPs then conducted a door-to-door health needs assessment utilizing a questionnaire adapted from a New York City Department of Health community health survey which had been tested and validated in several languages among many different immigrant groups. FINDINGS TO DATE: Thus far, seven community health promoters have been trained. 76 participants are enrolled in English as second language classes and 26 to 35 women participate in a weekly new mothers' support group. 14 out of 16 women are continuing to participate in a community based participatory research initiative.

	abstract = {Objective: Nurse telephone counseling can improve the management of chronic conditions, but the effectiveness of this approach in underserved populations is unclear. This study evaluated the use of bilingual nurse-delivered telephone counseling in Korean Americans (KAs) participating in a community-based intervention trial to improve management of hypertension. Method(s): KAs were randomized to receive 12 months of hypertension-related telephone counseling that was more intensive (bi-weekly) or less intensive (monthly). Counseling logs were kept for 360 KAs who completed the pre- and post-intervention evaluations. Result(s): The overall success rate for the intervention was 80.3\%. The level of success was significantly influenced by the dose of counseling, employment status, and years of US residence. Over the 12-month counseling period, both groups showed improvement with regard to medication-taking, alcohol consumption, and exercise but not smoking, with no significant group differences. Conclusion(s): Bilingual telephone counseling could reach monolingual KAs and improve their hypertension management behavior. Practice implications: Bilingual nurse telephone counseling may have wide applicability, serving as an effective means of disseminating evidence-based chronic disease management guidelines to a linguistically isolated community with limited health resources and information.

	volume = {141},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.023},
	abstract = {Background: Compared with Whites, many ethnic minority groups have higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The reasons for these ethnic inequalities in health are incompletely understood. The main objective was to examine whether socio-economic position (SEP) as measured by education was related to the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in different ethnic groups in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Method(s): A random sample of healthy adults aged 35-60 years. SEP was measured by educational level (secondary school and below (low), and vocational school and above (high)). Metabolic syndrome was measured according to the International Diabetic Federation guidelines. Result(s): Low education was negatively related to metabolic syndrome but only in White-Dutch people. Among White-Dutch men, the age adjusted prevalence ratio (95\% confidence intervals) for low education was 1.46 (95\% CI: 1.01-2.10) versus high education. Among White-Dutch women, the adjusted odds ratios for low education was 2.26 (95\% CI: 1.39-3.68) versus high education. In both White-Dutch men and women, low education was related to several components of metabolic syndrome. Among African-Surinamese and Hindustani-Surinamese, no significant associations were found between low education and metabolic syndrome and its components. Conclusion(s): Low education is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome among White-Dutch people but not among other ethnic groups. Community-based strategies to improve metabolic profiles may have to be ethnically devised. Among White-Dutch, targeting people with lower SEP may have an impact. However, among ethnic minority groups, both low and high socio-economic groups may have to be equally targeted to have an impact in reducing ethnic inequalities in health.

	abstract = {Objective: To survey the self-perceived capability of medically oriented child maltreatment teams in the US to provide mental health referrals and services when needed and to evaluate children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Method(s): Mailed questionnaire with 5 items related to mental health, 12 items on services for CSHCN, and 28 items on financial issues previously reported. Result(s): Responses were received from 320 of 472 organizations (67.8\%); 153 respondents had at least 1 physician or nurse practitioner and were included in the analysis; 91 were hospital-based teams (HBTs); and 62 were community-based teams (CBTs). CBTs were significantly more likely to offer mental health treatment (65.0\% vs 35.6\%). When mental health services were needed in another language, only half (50.7\%) indicated that services were available in Spanish, less than a third (29.3\%) could find services in sign language, and only 20.3\% expected to find services for patients who used other languages. Of all children evaluated, 31.2\% had special health care needs. CBTs reported seeing significantly more CSHCN than HBTs (38.3\% vs 26.5\%). Over two-thirds (67.7\%) did not have a special program or specialized staff to serve CSHCN. Overall, teams had some training and experience with CSHCN. Children who were deaf were evaluated by 84.5\% of teams, while only 50.5\% reported using professionally trained sign language interpreters. Most teams (82.2\%) indicated that more time was needed to evaluate CSHCN, and 69.1\% found arranging for mental health treatment for CSHCN more difficult than children without special needs. Conclusion(s): Medically oriented child maltreatment teams are generally able to arrange for mental health services for the children served, and most feel capable of serving CSHCN. Significantly more mental health service providers are needed for children and families who communicate in languages other than English (e.g., Spanish, American Sign Language [ASL]). Practice implications: Our results suggest that medically oriented child maltreatment teams and mental health services for maltreated children would improve gaps in services by: (1) recruiting and training bilingual professionals, (2) ensuring that children or family members who are deaf receive professional ASL services, and (3) ensuring that training is provided related to the needs of CSHCN.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jomh.2010.08.008},
	abstract = {Background: Men's Sheds are community-based places where men can enjoy each other's company and where self-worth can be promoted through the development of artistic or manual skills. The Shed helps men to strengthen and maintain social links and continue to feel they are useful members of the community once they have retired from the workforce. Method(s): The Building Healthy Men Project (BHMP) used the Men's Shed model to provide a group of retired and/or unemployed men from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds with opportunities to develop new skills, reduce their social isolation and increase their self-esteem and sense of purpose in an area of relative social disadvantage.This paper aims to contribute evidence on the types of outcomes for men's health and well-being that can be achieved and measured through their participation in a Men's Shed. Evaluation: The evaluation used a Participatory Action Research (PAR) process including a variety of data collection tools to examine the project processes and outcomes. Result(s): The evaluation showed that as a result of their involvement in the project the men increased their sense of purpose, self worth and self confidence. They also broadened their social networks and increased their skill levels. Conclusion(s): The BHMP evaluation highlighted lessons on the implementation and effects of an all-male social support network and the domains of outcome measurement that would be useful in health promotion programs targeting men from culturally diverse backgrounds in a socially disadvantaged area.

	abstract = {Limited data exist on how members of different cultures understand dementia. The Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimers Disease Center in collaboration with Coalition of Limited English Speaking Elderly and Alzheimers Association-Greater Illinois Chapter collaborated to raise awareness in 5 limited English proficiency (LEP) communities (Assyrian, Arabic, Bosnian, Hindi, and Urdu) during 2005 to 2008 through a grant from the Administration on Aging Alzheimers Disease Demonstration Grants to States. After the second year of the program, 267 individuals with cognitive impairment were identified with cognitive impairment and enrolled; however, only 13\% of those sought a medical evaluation to obtain a diagnosis or further help for their memory problems. This project sought to: (1) understand how these LEP community groups conceptualize dementia and (2) understand reasons LEP communities sought or did not seek a diagnosis. Using a community-based participatory research approach, ethnic community leaders conducted 48 interviews in a convenience sample of persons enrolled in the previous Administration on Aging demonstration grant. These interviews were conducted with family members of identified persons with dementia in their native language. Interview notes were translated and subjected to thematic analysis. The majority view memory loss as explainable and normative-due to aging, reaction to medication or trauma experienced by war, family problems, or the immigration experience. This conceptualization and the perception that a doctor cannot help influenced whether they sought an evaluation. Those who saw a doctor were looking for medical treatment and help with difficult behaviors. Experience in the doctors office was variable. Discussion of analysis with ethnic communities revealed the significance of stigma in the data gathering. Continued community-based participatory research approaches with LEP communities could further highlight needs for culturally relevant education and intervention.

	abstract = {The presence of Latinos in Virginia is a new phenomenon and as a result, less is known about the health needs of these newest community members. We formed a community-university partnership to identify health concerns and service needs as they relate to Latino youth living in Richmond, Virginia and the surrounding area. Using a mixed-method approach, survey data was obtained from 212 Latino adults, qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 community leaders and focus groups with 23 Latino parents (16 mothers, 7 fathers) and 6 Latino boys. Participants expressed concern about sexually transmitted infections/pregnancy among youth (76\%), youth behavior problems at home/school (75\%), and mental health problems (75\%). Participants also expressed worry that youth would lose their connection to their Latin culture (83\%). Qualitative data provided more information regarding these concerns by linking them with inter-ethnic tensions, and immigration and acculturation-related stressors. Survey participants also indicated a need for bilingual mental health services (88\%) and after-school programs for youth (94\%). This study provided the local community with information on the health concerns and service needs of a new group of community youth-Latino youth. Findings were presented to local community and City organizations that used the information to respond to the identified needs and/or concerns. The process in which the data was obtained may prove useful to other individuals interested in obtaining local level health information in emerging communities.

	doi = {10.1016/j.canep.2009.10.001},
	abstract = {Background: Despite evidence of a decline in both incidence and prevalence of colorectal cancer nationwide, it remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality among Asian Americans, including Korean Americans. This community-based and theoretically guided study evaluated a culturally appropriate intervention program that included a bilingual cancer educational program among Korean Americans including information on CRC risks, counseling to address psychosocial and access barriers, and patient navigation assistance. Method(s): A two-group quasi-experimental design with baseline and post-intervention assessment and a 12-month follow-up on screening was used in the study. Korean Americans (N = 167) were enrolled from six Korean churches. The intervention group received culturally appropriate intervention program addressing accessibility and psychosocial barriers, and navigation assistance for screening. The control group received general health education that included cancer-related health issues and screening. Result(s): There was a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.05) between the post-intervention and control groups in awareness of CRC risk factors. There was also a significant improvement in the pre-post across HBM measures in the intervention group for perceived susceptibility (p {\textless} 0.05) and benefits and barriers to screening (p {\textless} 0.001). At baseline, 13\% of participants in the intervention group and 10\% in control group reported having had a CRC cancer screening test in the previous year. At the 12-month post-intervention follow-up, 77.4\% of participants in the intervention group had obtained screening compared to 10.8\% in the control group. Conclusion(s): While health disparities result from numerous factors, a culturally appropriate and church-based intervention can be highly effective in increasing knowledge of and access to, and in reducing barriers to CRC screening among underserved Koreans.

	volume = {48},
	doi = {10.1093/rheumatology/ken464},
	abstract = {Objective. To assess the acceptability for use of information on osteomalacia for South Asian patients. Methods. Ten focus groups of South Asian persons speaking Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu (one male and one female group for each language) were used to evaluate the written (leaflets) and spoken information (CD) on osteomalacia for South Asian patients produced by the Arthritis Research Campaign (ARC). Focus group discussion was facilitated by community-based workers using the Social Action Research Method. A subsidiary evaluation of the information was conducted by a questionnaire-based survey sent to British Society of Rheumatology/ British Health Professionals in Rheumatology (BSR/BHPR) members and others who had requested such materials from ARC in the past. Results. Evaluation by focus groups revealed that there were potential difficulties relating to the understanding of the information leaflets and CDs and problematic issues regarding the quality of translation and pronunciation. Evaluation by BSR/BHPR members and others who had requested such material was that although the information was culturally appropriate, there were some weak areas such as mispronunciation, the quality of translation and specific customs. Conclusion. Healthcare information resources for minority ethnic groups has traditionally been developed depending upon the needs of the community, the language spoken and cultural norms. Such information is regarded as 'culturally sensitive'. However, an additional dimension is required. Information should be evaluated by the community and also specific users in order to determine its acceptability. This test of 'cultural competence' can ensure that such information has real practical value. An iterative evaluation process with feedback and refinement of information resources for minority ethnic groups is essential. Â© The Author 2009.

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine an association between pain severity and functional disability in older Mexican Americans. Design(s): Cross-sectional study (2005/06), a subsample of the Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly. Setting(s): Community. Participant(s): One thousand thirteen Mexican American aged 74 to 100. Measurement: Bilingual interviewers administered structured questionnaires and assessed physical measures of mobility and frailty (exhaustion, weight loss, walking speed, grip strength, and self-reported physical activity). Two items from the SF-36 questionnaire assessed pain experiences in the previous 4 weeks. Result(s): Chi-square one-way analysis of variance and least square and negative binomial regressions were computed for 744 participants with complete data to investigate experience of pain and other dimensions of health and functioning. Close to two-thirds (64.7\%) reported pain within 4 weeks of the interview, and 49.7\% reported that pain interfered with performance of daily activities. Female sex; low education; frailty; reduced mobility; disability; and high comorbidity, body mass index, and depressive symptomatology were significantly associated with pain severity and interference. Regression coefficients revealed that pain severity was significantly related to disability in activities of daily living (0.22, P{\textless}.001) and instrumental activities of daily living (0.23, P{\textless}.01) after controlling for sociodemographic and health status characteristics. Conclusion(s): The findings expand the pain literature on older Mexican Americans. High pain rates were most prevalent in women and subjects with high comorbidity, high depressive symptomatology, poor mobility, and frailty. Pain also plays a significant role in disability status.

	abstract = {South Asia has 22 percent of the world's population but only 1.3 percent of the global income. Consequently 40 percent of the population is living in absolute poverty. However the health transition in some of its countries including India and Sri Lanka is a testimony to the fact that there are proven solutions to the problems of health and development within the region. The countries of the region have much in common, including a democratic political system, four major religions, a vibrant and living tradition of voluntarism and an extensive health infrastructure which is operating well below par. Despite the underlying unity, South Asia enjoys enormous cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity. In this large, complex and vibrant region, health promotion is a challenging task, but it also holds the key to a dramatic change in the global health situation. Many of these solutions lie in wider areas of socio-political action. There are much needed shifts in the health promotion and development efforts, particularly in the area of poverty and social justice; gender inequity; population stabilisation; health and environment; control of communicable and non-communicable diseases; and urban health strategies. The principle of cooperation, partnership and intersectoral collaboration for health will be explored. Developing an appropriate, sustainable and people centred health and development strategy in the coming decades is an enormous challenge. There has been an attempt to focus on the emerging needs of the region, which call for health promotion, and involvement of civil society, private sector and the governments bestowed with the increased responsibility of ensuring health security for people. Strengthening the existing health systems, allocating adequate resources for health development and ensuring community participation are all prerequisites to the success of health promotion in the region.},

One area for strategic development in the field of health education is the design and evaluation of English-as-a-Second language (ESL) curricula. The theoretical perspective of the Health Behavior Framework, results from a community-based survey of Chinese Canadian immigrants with limited English proficiency, and findings from focus groups of ESL instructors as well as Chinese ESL students were used to develop a hepatitis B ESL educational module. This research was conducted in Vancouver, BC. Survey data showed that less than three-fifths of the respondents had been tested for hepatitis B, and documented some important hepatitis B knowledge deficits. Further, only about one-quarter had ever received a physician recommendation for hepatitis B serologic testing. The ESL curriculum aims to both promote hepatitis B testing and improve knowledge, and includes seven different ESL exercises: Warm-up, vocabulary cards, information-gap, video, jigsaw, guided discussion, and problem/advice cards. Our quantitative and qualitative methods for curriculum development could be replicated for other health education topics and in other limited English speaking populations.

	abstract = {Prevention remains key in the fight against HIV/AIDS. However, prevention requires understanding the sociocultural and economic context in which HIV-risk behaviors occur. This qualitative, descriptive study was part of the initial phase of a larger project to adapt and test a community-based HIV-prevention intervention. We conducted individual interviews with rural Malawian community leaders and focus groups with adult community residents to elicit perceptions of both sexual and non-sexual HIV-risk behaviors and their sociocultural context. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in Chichewa, audio-taped, transcribed and translated into English by bilingual co-investigators. Content analysis of transcripts was done collaboratively by US-based and Malawian co-investigators to confirm culturally accurate interpretation of data. Participants identified sexual and non-sexual HIV-risk behaviors and contextual factors that influence these behaviors, including gender relations, cultural practices, economic conditions and religion. Community leaders and residents voiced similar perspectives on risk behaviors, except that community leaders were much less likely than residents to discuss sexual transmission through participation in traditional cultural practices. We incorporated these study results in adapting our HIV-prevention intervention to the sociocultural context of rural Malawi.

Design(s): Participatory Action Research using Aboriginal traditional symbolism to depict aspects of the research process, interview surveys and a document review. Setting(s): A regional town with 629 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents and a newly established Aboriginal health and well-being centre (Nunyara). Participant(s): Thirty Aboriginal community members were interviewed about their involvement with Nunyara and their health issues. Participants were selected through purposive 'pass-me-around' sampling to ensure that all family groups were included. Result(s): The results are presented in two areas: the structure of the Aboriginal community that affects participation and community views about health issues. Aboriginal people living in the town come from 10 or more different language groups and relate almost exclusively within their own groups. Activities at Nunyara were seen as individual family group events and not for everyone. Aboriginal community participants had a broad view of health as they reported problems that included smoking and alcohol use. Almost all would like more involvement in health issues through Nunyara. Conclusion(s): Aboriginal community members are willing to get involved in health issues in collaboration with Nunyara. However, fundamental to increasing participation is to bring people together from different family groups and increase social cohesion. This can be done through developing relationships with groups enabling different points of view to be heard and valued.

	abstract = {This study qualitatively explored social capital available to individuals (N = 17) within a community-based purposive sample of adult male immigrants from India in New York City (NYC). Analysis of in-depth interview data identified possible pathways for social capital's influences upon acculturative stress. The study defined social capital in terms of the participants' social relationships among peers, in the workplace, and with their ethnic community. Their relationships were assessed in terms of support, trust, and reciprocity. Among the recent immigrants, hopelessness and frustration about future work prospects were associated with symptoms of depression and substance abuse. The participants identified wealth as a distinct marker of social class and they described social class as a combination of education and occupation. Social class largely determined the particular peer and community networks each participant joined. Participants relied upon ongoing connections with family in India, despite their geographic separation, to relieve acculturative stress. Social support from peers was the participants' most useful and immediate resource for alleviating acculturative stress. For participants of lower socioeconomic status, acculturative stress was compounded by social-relationship expectations and norms from India that persisted within NYCs immigrant community. Namely, lower-SES participants were more likely to experience frustration and setbacks when they sought out intimate social relationships with women. Â© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

	abstract = {In the United States, approximately 78\% of agricultural farmworkers are immigrants. In Oregon, a growing number of these farmworkers are indigenous and speak an indigenous language as their primary language. This group of farmworkers suffers from linguistic, cultural and geographic isolation and faces a unique set of challenges yet little has been done to identify their health needs. Using data from focus groups, partners from this community-based participatory research project examined indigenous farmworkers' concerns regarding occupational injury and illness, experiences of discrimination and disrespect, and language and cultural barriers. The data revealed examples of disrespect and discrimination based on the languages and cultures of indigenous farmworkers, and a lack of basic occupational health and safety information and equipment. For example, participants mentioned that occupational safety information was inaccessible because it was rarely provided in indigenous languages, and participants felt there were no legal means to protect farmworkers from occupational hazards. Community-based strategies designed to address the occupational health status of farmworkers must consider the unique circumstances of those farmworkers who do not speak Spanish or English.

In an effort to train and mobilize community residents effectively in the skills needed to engage in advocacy and systems change, the traditional delivery model of community engagement (surveys, focus groups, large and small forums, health fairs, and street fairs) was replaced with culturally specific, active engagement strategies. Engaging diverse communities in Mid-City (Latino, Somali, and Vietnamese) required an approach that included hiring bilingual, bicultural staff recruited from those communities, hosting meetings in residents' homes, and providing extensive leadership training and support for residents. This community resident leadership initiative, piloted in the Latino community of mid-city San Diego, was successful in engaging resident participation in the process. This paper outlines the lessons learned from this initiative. Â© 2008 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and overlap of symptom patterns traditionally associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and incontinence among men and women in a racially and ethnically diverse, community-based population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 5506 men and women aged 30-79 years were recruited to participate in the Boston Area Community Health Survey, using a stratified-cluster sampling technique to obtain roughly similar representative samples by age group, gender and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic). Survey data were collected by bilingual interviewers in subjects' homes. Scales measuring symptom patterns were derived from validated instruments, with minor changes to eliminate different recall periods and overlap in items that might have confused subjects. RESULT(S): About a quarter of men and women of all ages met the definition for one or more of the target symptom patterns; there was no significant variation in the prevalence of any of the symptom patterns by race/ethnicity. Overall, =16\% of men and women had one symptom pattern, while 7\% had overlap patterns. Except for urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in both men and women, the prevalence of all symptom complexes were associated with one another significantly more often that would be expected by chance. CONCLUSION(S): Overlapping patterns of lower urinary tract symptoms and pelvic pain are common. These overlapping patterns present challenges for clinical practice and research, and require further investigation of their causes, diagnosis and optimum treatment. Â© 2007 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: To understand low uptake of breast cancer screening through exploring the personal reasoning underlying women's attendance or non-attendance, and identifying differences between those who attend and those who decline. Design(s): Cross-sectional survey. Setting(s): Community and home environments of women eligible for breast screening aged 50-64 years, living in South East London. Method(s): Structured, self-completed or assisted-completion questionnaires. Result(s): The decision to attend or decline screening is rational and personally justifiable, engaging factors linked to emotions and attitude. Attitudes about breast screening and perceived personal importance of breast screening are the strongest predictors of attendance and non-attendance. There are differences between ethnic groups in perceptions of breast screening. Regular attendance at screening is associated with ethnicity, although consistent avoidance of mammography is not. Inconvenience is an important factor in missing appointments, and tends to be prolonged rather than specific to the time or day of the pre-booked invitation. GP and health worker advice are good persuaders towards attendance. Pain and anxiety during mammography are notable dissuaders against re-attending. Conclusion(s): Appropriate service provision requires consideration of local factors, as well as the medical needs of the population eligible for breast screening. Lay perceptions of potential personal costs of attending or not attending breast screening are important for guiding health promotion. Information providers should consider the language needs of a culturally and educationally mixed community. Health care professionals are well placed to encourage uptake of breast screening through disseminating information that promotes attendance, both within and outside the breast screening service. copyright Â© SAGE 2007.},

	abstract = {Disenfranchised ethnic minority communities in the urban United States experience a high burden of asthma. Conventional office-based patient education often is insufficient to promote proper asthma management and coping practices responsive to minority patients' environments. This paper explores existing and alternative asthma information and education sources in three urban minority communities in western New York State to help design other practical educational interventions. Four focus groups (n = 59) and four town hall meetings (n = 109) were conducted in one Hispanic and two black communities. Focus groups included adult asthmatics or caretakers of asthmatics, and town meetings were open to all residents. A critical theory perspective informed the study. Asthma information and education sources, perceptions of asthma and ways of coping were elicited through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis followed a theory-driven immersion-crystallization approach. Several asthma education and information resources from the health care system, media, public institutions and communities were identified. Intervention recommendations highlighted asthma workshops that recognize participants as teachers and learners, offer social support, promote advocacy, are culturally appropriate and community-based and include health care professionals. Community-based, group health education couched on people's experiences and societal conditions offers unique opportunities for patient asthma care empowerment in minority urban communities.

	abstract = {Objective: To develop and refine a complex intervention for diabetes support and education in minority ethnic groups, delivered through bilingual health advocates. Design(s): Action research framework-a variety of methods used in an emergent and developmental manner, in partnership with clinicians, managers, and service users, drawing especially but not exclusively on narrative methods. Setting(s): Deprived inner London district Interventions: Development and evaluation of three components of the complex intervention: a group based learning set for bilingual health advocates, in which stories about clients with diabetes formed the basis for action learning; advocate led support and education groups for people with diabetes, which used personal stories as the raw material for learning and action; organisational support to help to develop these new models and embed them within existing services. Result(s): Both advocate groups and user groups were popular and well evaluated. Through storytelling, advocates identified and met their own educational needs in relation to diabetes and the unmet needs of service users. In the advocate led user groups, story fragments were exchanged in a seemingly chaotic way that the research team initially found difficult to facilitate or follow. Stories were not so much told as enacted and were often centred on discussion of "what to do." Whereas some organisations welcomed, successfully implemented, and sustained the advocate led groups, others failed to do so. A key component of the complex intervention was organisational support. Conclusion(s): An action research approach allowed engagement with an underserved group of health service staff and with hard to reach service users. The study produced subjective benefits to these groups locally as well as a worked-up complex intervention that will now be formally tested in a randomised controlled trial.},

	abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Despite growing awareness of the benefits of physical activity for older people, some population subgroups remain particularly hard to engage, especially those with English as a second language (ESL) and frail older people. METHOD(S): A qualitative investigation of an existing community-based physical activity provider - Active Involved Mature (AIM)--was undertaken, including in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 12 key partners and nine class instructors, and focus groups with 58 class participants. RESULT(S): Health benefits and social factors were strong incentives for participation among both ESL and frail groups. Some differences were evident between these two groups in their needs and strategies reported as addressing these needs. Partners described AIM as a quality service with a commitment to working with groups in need, responsive to the local community and with a good track record of collaborative work. Specific strategies targeted engagement and long-term participation. CONCLUSION(S): Social and environmental strategies, in addition to cognitive and behavioural approaches, supported participation of ESL and frail older people in AIM's group-based physical activity classes. Development of community and organisational partnerships, targeting to group needs (for ESL groups) and tailoring to individual requirements (for frail participants) were also seen as key features for success. These program elements are supported by, and grounded in, current health promotion and behavioural theory.},

The workshops were created through an interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty from seven health care professions and focused on three healthcare topics identified in Healthy People 2010: dementia and depression, stress reduction, and physical activity. The development of workshop content and structure, including didactic and interactive components, an approach to interdisciplinary student involvement, and program evaluation by clients and community center staff, are presented as a model for other educators. The workshops presented at five senior centers were attended by 1110 mostly female clients with an average age of 74 yrs and with a large proportion self-identified as of minority background. One hundred seven students from seven healthcare programs helped deliver the workshops. Interviews and surveys of the clients demonstrated that most had a positive learning experience, whereas the evidence of intent to take action on health care issues was less definitive. Analysis of student essays demonstrated increased student understanding of older adults and of community services. A website, Geriatric Educational Resources for Instructors and Elders (www.GERIE.org), was created to provide access to the instructional and resource materials used for the workshops, including presentation materials in Spanish. This model program may help address the substantial health education needs of a growing population of older adults from diverse ethnic, cultural, and language minorities.},

	abstract = {Objectives. - Pregnancy rates among Filipino American adolescents exceed those of other Asian and Pacific Islander adolescents. Strong parent-adolescent communication may promote healthy sexual development and protect against adolescent sexual risk behaviors. We explored communication barriers between Filipino American parents and adolescents. Methods. - Using community-based participatory research (CBPR), we collaborated with Filipino American community leaders, parents, and adolescents to design a focus-group study. Trained bilingual moderators conducted focus groups with 85 Filipino Americans (41 parents and grandparents and 44 adolescents aged 14-18 years) from various neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes. Results. - Focus-group participants appeared to divide sex information into 3 categories, which we termed facts, feelings, and values. Adolescents emphasized facts and feelings. Parents and grandparents emphasized facts and values. In general, facts were obtained through school, feelings through friends, and values through parents. The focus groups identified large barriers to value transmission, stemming from adolescent acculturation to the United States. Parents and grandparents felt that values were transmitted best through traditional Filipino respect for parents who often eschewed open discussion. Adolescents believed that open discussion was necessary for value transmission to occur. The result was bilateral withdrawal from family communication about sex. Conclusions. - Our focus groups found that parent-child communication about sex, especially regarding values, was limited. Potential causes included conflicts between Filipino and US beliefs regarding respect for parents and open discussion. Our results raise important questions about the effect of acculturation on sex education for Filipino American adolescents and demonstrate potential advantages of CBPR.

This paper reports on case studies of diverse community-based health and wellbeing services for men in South Australia. The programs selected as case studies include Aboriginal men, gay men and homosexually active men, men from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, older men, middle-aged men, fathers, young men, as well as services that focus on childhood sexual abuse and violence intervention. The case studies share the following main features-they have a social view of health, use a primary health care approach with an emphasis on prevention, address issues of access and equity, use social justice principles, and work across a number of sectors. These features were integrated into a socially just primary health care framework for men's health in community health settings. Socially just primary health care can address health inequities within men's health that are related to, among other things, class, race, ethnicity and sexuality. Socially just primary health care services can work collaboratively with women's health on common concerns such as violence intervention and childhood sexual abuse. Moreover, socially just primary health care services reflect local concerns, where health professionals work with men rather than acting as outside experts.},

Qualitative data analysis identified 13 themes, which were grouped into the following three domains: 1) psychosocial factors identified as influencing sexual risk health behaviors; 2) system-level barriers to sexual health; and 3) characteristics of potentially effective HIV prevention intervention approaches. The study findings suggest that community-based, male-centered interpersonal networks that provide individual and group education and skill-building and incorporate curanderos (Latino healers) and bilingual experts may be important elements of potentially effective intervention approaches to reach Latino men, who have been inaccessible to conventional HIV prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess how English language use by Hispanic women affects their preferences for participating in decision making and information seeking regarding medical care. Method(s): The study included 235 Hispanic women aged 35-61 years participating in a larger multicenter study, the Ethnicity, Needs, and Decisions of Women (ENDOW) Project. Participants were recruited from community settings and primary care public health clinics. Bilingual (English and Spanish speaking) interviewers asked participants questions about demographic characteristics, health status, reproductive history, menopausal status, access to healthcare, experience with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and hysterectomy, outcome expectations about HRT and hysterectomy, medical decision making and social support. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we assessed the relationships between the participants' preferences for participating in decision making and information seeking, their language use, and other covariates of interest. Result(s): Overall, the participants expressed a strong desire for information about and participating in medical decisions. However, they expressed a lower preference for participating in decisions related to use of HRT compared with the desire for engaging in decision involving invasive medical procedures (hysterectomy and cholecystectomy) and high blood pressure management. Increased use of English language was significantly associated with preferences for participating in medical care decision making, in general (p {\textless} 0.001), and with information seeking (p = 0.044). Decreased use of English language was associated with a lower desire for participating in medical care decision making. Conclusion(s): Increased use of English language may influence Hispanic women's preferences for participating in medical decisions and their information-seeking behavior. Â© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Covering Kids and Families (CKF) program seeks to expand health insurance coverage for children by supporting community-based outreach and enrollment. For the evaluation of CKF, researchers conducted focus groups to explore parents' experiences accessing health care for their children, and to assess whether these experiences affected decisions to enroll their children in Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Method(s): In May and June 2003, 13 focus groups were conducted in 5 cities - Everett, MA; Denver, CO; Los Angeles, CA; Mena, AR; and San Antonio, TX. In each community, groups were conducted with parents of children insured under Medicaid or SCHIP and parents of uninsured children. Three groups were conducted with Spanish-speaking parents in two communities - Denver and Los Angeles. Result(s): Access to primary care was considered good by most parents with children in Medicaid and SCHIP. Among parents of uninsured children, there was more variation in perceptions of access to care. For parents of both uninsured and insured children, access to dentists and specialists was more problematic. Spanish-speaking families reported numerous barriers to care due to language differences and perceived discrimination. All focus group participants said that they placed great value on health insurance. Conclusion(s): Even when parents encountered problems accessing care, very few indicated that this discouraged them from enrolling their children into Medicaid or SCHIP, or from renewing their children's public coverage.

The Network focused on 5 significant cancers: breast, cervical, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The Steering Committee initiated a review process for junior researchers that resulted in 5 NCI-funded pilot projects. Pilot projects were conducted with various Latino populations. The Network developed community education and health promotion projects including the bilingual outreach play The Cancer Monologues. The Network's partnership also started and held 2 annual health fairs, Dia de la Mujer Latina/Day of the Latina Woman, and annual health prevention summits. The Special Population Network (SPN) adapted and revised a clinical trials education outreach module that reached Network community partners. SPN partners recruited Latino/a students to cancer research through a 6-week NCI training program held yearly at the UCHSC campus. The Network methodology of bringing together the Latino community with the scientific community increased the level of awareness of cancer in the Latino community and increased cancer research and the level of engagement of the scientific partners with the Latino community.

The populations studied are diverse in ethnicity and social class and reside in urban and rural environments. Although almost all of the centers chose to enroll participants through medical care facilities, they had to develop independent staffs and structures because of the overburdened medical care system. Some of the lessons learned by the centers include the importance of continuous funding, building community partnerships to conduct culturally appropriate research, hiring bilingual and bicultural staff from the community, prioritizing research goals, developing biorepositories to ensure future utility of samples, instituting quality control procedures for all aspects of specimen and data collection, maintaining frequent contact with study participants, ensuring ethical conduct of the research in a changing medical-legal climate, and communicating results in a timely and appropriate manner to participants and the wider community. All centers underestimated the necessary start-up time, staff, and costs in conducting these birth cohort studies. Despite the logistical complexity and added expenses, all centers emphasize the importance of studying the impact of environmental exposures on those children most at risk, those living in minority and low-income communities. These centers present barriers encountered, solutions found, and considerations for future research, with the hope that the lessons learned can help inform the planning and conduct of the National Children's Study.},

This paper illustrates a participatory research methodology adapted by community residents and a research team to identify the service needs of an underserved Hispanic population as well as set action agendas to meet their needs. In order to plan and implement health programs, community residents participated actively in the needs assessment, action agenda development and brainstorming of solutions to address health and community needs and concerns. Concerns identified included the lack of affordable bilingual dentists and youth involvement in gangs, drugs, and alcohol. The results of the needs assessment were shared and discussed during five public forums in which 180 Hispanics from the community discussed the dimensions of the issues and alternative solutions. This process resulted in an agenda of health issues and ideas for improvement from the perspective of Hispanics. We emphasized the advantages of using participatory methodologies when developing health and community services within Hispanic communities.

In addition, cancer registry data show that Southeast Asians experience several cancer-related health disparities (e.g., markedly elevated risks of cervical and liver cancer). The Seattle regional Asian American Network for Cancer, Awareness, Research, and Training (AANCART) site has implemented a community-based cancer awareness program for Cambodian immigrants in collaboration with a Cambodian community coalition. Our cancer awareness program has the following goals: to assist individuals and organizations in advocating for a healthy community, to provide information within a cultural context, and to deliver information in ways that are useful and meaningful to the community. The program was guided by a community assessment that included the use of published data as well as information from qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative surveys. Examples of community awareness activities include group presentations at community-based organizations (e.g., during English as a second language classes), health fair participation (including at nontraditional venues such as a farmers' market serving Cambodians), and educational displays in neighborhood locations (e.g., at Cambodian video stores). In addition, the Seattle AANCART site has both inventoried and developed culturally appropriate Khmer language cancer education materials and disseminated materials through the ETHNOMED website. Our approach recognizes that limited English language proficiency may preclude many Cambodians from understanding publicly disseminated information, and Cambodian immigrants are often isolated and tend to stay close to their own neighborhoods.

Both interpreter- and language-concordant clinicians may help overcome these problems but few studies have compared these approaches. OBJECTIVE(S): To compare self-reported communication and visit ratings for LEP Asian immigrants whose visits involve either a clinic interpreter or a clinician speaking their native language. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey-response rate 74\%. PATIENTS: Two thousand seven hundred and fifteen LEP Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant adults who received care at 11 community-based health centers across the U.S. MEASUREMENTS: Five self-reported communication measures and overall rating of care. RESULT(S): Patients who used interpreters were more likely than language-concordant patients to report having questions about their care (30.1\% vs 20.9\%, P{\textless}.001) or about mental health (25.3\% vs 18.2\%, P=.005) they wanted to ask but did not. They did not differ significantly in their response to 3 other communication measures or their likelihood of rating the health care received as "excellent" or "Very good" (51.7\% vs 50.9\%, P=.8). Patients who rated their interpreters highly ("excellent" or "Very good") were more likely to rate the health care they received highly (adjusted odds ratio 4.8, 95\% confidence interval, 2.3 to 10.1). CONCLUSION(S): Assessments of communication and health care quality for outpatient visits are similar for LEP Asian immigrants who use interpreters and those whose clinicians speak their language. However, interpreter use may compromise certain aspects of communication. The perceived quality of the interpreter is strongly associated with patients' assessments of quality of care overall.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop bilingual health advocate (BHA)-led group education and support groups for South Asian patients with diabetes, based on a storytelling format. The design and setting were action research in a deprived inner London district. The research team worked developmentally with BHAs, service users and other stakeholders to assess need, train staff, and set up and evaluate the storytelling groups. Stories were chosen as the main vehicle for education because of their universal appeal, memorability, holistic perspective, ethical dimensions, and potential for multiple interpretations. Key challenges in the project were: high burden of need; multiple stakeholders; a shifting baseline of policy directives; frequent staff changes; resource constraints; and resistance of top and middle management to new service models. These difficulties made progress slow, and several early initiatives failed to take root. However, we succeeded in developing a nationally accredited training programme ('Storytelling for group work in health and care') for BHAs, and in supporting the graduates from this course to set up two groups for South Asian patients with diabetes - one in a hospital and one in a community centre. The patient storytelling groups, once established, were popular and well evaluated. Blood glucose levels in regular attenders fell, but changes did not reach statistical significance. An action research approach allowed us successfully to develop an innovative training programme for BHAs and support them in developing and mainstreaming new service models. BHA-led diabetes storytelling groups, supported by health professionals, are feasible and popular with non-English speaking Asian patients. Their impact on diabetes outcomes should now be formally evaluated in clinical trials. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Although the English and Chinese versions of the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) are commonly considered equivalent, they have not been compared in terms of variability. Furthermore, bilingual and monolingual persons may differ in cognition and responses to questionnaires. Method(s): In a community-based survey of quality of life in Singapore, a society where both English and Chinese are widely used and bilingualism is prevalent, 2590 respondents answered either version of the SF-36. We studied the impact of questionnaire version and bilingualism on the variability of SF-36 scores by regression modelling, with adjustment for covariates. Result(s): The Chinese version had smaller variances in the physical functioning (PF) and the physical component summary scores than the English version. The variance ratios (VRs) were respectively 0.32 and 0.60 (each p {\textless} 0.01), controlling for covariates. Bilingualism was not associated with variability in SF-36 scores except PF (VR = 0.78; p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion(s): As a result of a smaller variance, using the Chinese version of SF-36 among bilingual Chinese people may require a smaller sample size than using the English version.},

	abstract = {Recently renamed "Listening to Ethnic Communities about Diabetes", this project was a winner of the 2003 Innovation and Excellence in Primary Health Care Award, Community and Consumer Participation category. The project is also being promoted as a model of best practice in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community engagement. Listening to Ethnic Communities about Diabetes focused on Type 2 diabetes by developing, piloting and evaluating culturally appropriate primary and secondary prevention health promotion strategies with Maltese, Filipino and Vietnamese communities in the municipality of Brimbank, Victoria. One of the critical success factors for the project was that, while the project was grounded in a health promotion framework, the lead agency did not have a great deal of health expertise. Rather, the focus of its expertise was on relationships with ethnic communities. This allowed for a shift in traditional power structures as the communities were given a real voice and decision-making powers. While the health service providers had the clinical and practical knowledge and expertise in diabetes, it was the involvement of the ethno-specific organisations and ethnic community representatives that enabled the project to develop and pilot models of service provision which had relevance and accessibility to the target community. The project also demonstrated the value in utilising a diverse range of strategies that reflect the cultural practices and preferences of the target communities through being developed and tested in partnership with the communities.},

The project, which took place between 1996 and 2000, evaluated a range of health and quality of life outcomes for 50 children and their families, using a triangulated approach incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. This paper presents five qualitative themes which were identified as important contributors to optimal asthma education and support with this inner city population: time and timing; language and cultural appropriateness; tailoring education and support to needs; collaboration and coordination of care; and educator-participant relationship.

Data were obtained by group discussion and through the media using a structured format. Fifteen themes emerged which were grouped under three broad themes: firstly, the identification by group members of their perception of the 'differences' in social and cultural beliefs and behaviours of their individual community; secondly, the identification of characteristics of a culturally sensitive doctor; and lastly, recommendations for changes in medical training. New teaching has been introduced to the medical curriculum that incorporates the themes raised by the communities and which reflects consciousness raising and communication issues.

	abstract = {Introduction: This is a preliminary report from a research collaboration between Asian Health Services (community health center); Koreans in Alameda County, California; and the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health. This five-year Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project supports a collaborative community intervention to improve breast and cervical cancer screening behavior among Korean women. Method(s): A Korean Community Advisory Board and KoreanAmerican staff were recruited, and community sensitive research (CSR) and participatory action research (PAR) principles were applied: (1) building community infrastructure for sustainable action, (2) cultural appropriateness, (3) assuring responsiveness to community needs, and (4) a prevention focus that would assist health care providers. We conducted a population-based telephone survey on 676 Korean adults (272 men and 404 women). Result(s): The collaborative process yielded (1) a high response rate (79\%), (2) baseline health information on Korean Americans, (3) broadening of the original research topic, (4) survey responses that will guide intervention design, (5) culturally competent strategies, and (6) expanded Korean-American Community capacity for local action. Conclusion(s): Research collaboration between universities, community- based organizations, and ethnic communities can yield high-quality research. CSR and PAR approaches help break through cultural barriers in otherwise 'hard to reach' API subpopulations. Determinants of success include sharing common goals; trust, honesty, and integrity; shared decision making; mutual respect of each partner's expertise; cultural sensitivity and cultural competence; flexibility, good communication, and mutual learning; and continuity of partners. Actively engaging members of the study population in the research process builds community capacity, thus laying the foundation for future projects that improve health status.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To promote community participation in exploring perceptions of psychological distress amongst Pakistani and Bangladeshi people, in order to develop appropriate services. Design(s): Training and facilitation of resident community members (as community project workers), to define and conduct qualitative research involving semistructured interviews in their own communities, informing primary care led commissioning and service decision making. Setting(s): A socio-economically disadvantaged inner-city locality in the UK. Participant(s): One-hundred and four South Asian people (49 of Pakistani and 55 of Bangladeshi origin), interviewed by 13 resident community members. Result(s): All community project workers completed training leading to a National Vocational Qualification, and successfully executed the research. Most study respondents located their main sources of stress within pervasive experience of racism and socio-economic disadvantage. They were positive about 'talking' and neutral listening as helpful, but sought strategies beyond non-directive counselling services that embraced practical welfare advice and social support. The roles of primary health care professionals were believed to be restricted to physical ill health rather than personal distress. The importance of professionals' sex, age, ethnicity and social status were emphasized as affecting open communication. Practical recommendations for the re-orientation and provision of services were generated and implemented in response to the findings, through dialogue with a primary care commissioning group, Health and Local Authority, and voluntary agencies. Conclusion(s): The work illustrates the feasibility and value of a community participation approach to research and service development in addressing a challenging and neglected area of minority ethnic health need. It offers one model for generating responsive service change in the context of current health policy in the UK, whilst also imparting skills and empowering community members. The study findings emphasize the need to recognize the social contexts in which distress is experienced and have implications for effective responses.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for Latinos living in the United States. This population is generally unaware of important lifestyle or behavioral changes that can prevent CVD. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) designed and implemented Salud para su Corazon (Health for Your Heart), a culturally appropriate, community- based, theory-driven intervention model. NHLBI's goals were: (1) to design an intervention model appropriate to Latino populations; (2) to pilot test the model in a specific community with the objectives of increasing awareness about heart disease, raising knowledge about CVD prevention, and promoting heart-healthy lifestyles; and (3) to disseminate the model and the materials developed to other communities with similar needs. An agency-community partnership, under the leadership of the Community Alliance for Heart Health, guided all stages of the community intervention project. The multimedia bilingual community intervention included television telenovela format public service announcements (PSAs), radio programs, brochures, recipe booklets, charlas, a promotores training manual, and motivational videos. An evaluation survey assessed the impact of the intervention. A pre-post intervention survey was conducted with more than 300 participants, and results showed that the respondents were substantially more aware of risk factors for CVD, and had greatly increased their knowledge of ways to prevent heart disease. Dissemination efforts have resulted in numerous requests by health organizations, universities, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for educational materials and communication strategies produced by Salud para su Corazon. In addition, Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcast television network, is airing the initiative's PSAs. Also, training seminars for promotores are being conducted in different regions of the United States, and several locations are planning to replicate this study.},

Members of minority communities have considerable skepticism about the health care system and researchers who work under its auspices. To facilitate quality research, it is necessary to build a mutually beneficial partnership between the community and researchers. Suggested strategies for accomplishing this goal, such as seeking out information on the social and political forces shaping the community and developing the community's capacity to undertake research of this type, are described. Methodologic issues include the importance of community input in defining the minority population group and its leadership, the benefits and limitations of conducting comparative analysis, and the need for measurement tools and techniques that are culturally and socially appropriate. Minority and nonminority researchers must make a concerted effort to gain knowledge of and respect for a community whose culture, values, and beliefs may differ from their own.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE - Although Caribbean Latinos are two to three times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to develop diabetes, cultural influences on nutrition and health are poorly understood. To provide insight into important features of diabetes prevention and management, we conducted focus groups to explore nutrition practices and health beliefs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Thirty low-income urban Caribbean Latinos with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and four family members participated in four focus group interviews that were conducted in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, were tape recorded, and were led and analyzed by Latino professionals from a community-based health organization. RESULTS - Consistent themes described by participants were feelings of social isolation, little understanding of long-term consequences of diabetes, fatalism regarding the course of the disease, multiple barriers to diet and exercise interventions, skepticism regarding the value of preventive health behaviors, prevalent use of traditional nonmedical remedies, and a clear need for culturally sensitive health-care providers and services. CONCLUSIONS - The information from focus groups provides useful information for planning innovative intervention programs for chronic disease risk reduction that emphasize practical skills development, family/peer networks, empowerment techniques, and bilingual providers. We conclude that the focus group technique can be used effectively with low-income, urban minority populations to provide information on lifestyle behaviors and beliefs regarding chronic diseases that impact on health and nutritional status.},

For instance, Spanish-speaking women were much less likely to have heard about breast cancer in the past 12 months compared with their English-speaking counterparts. Hispanic women were also half as likely as White women to ever have a mammogram. The intervention activities being implemented in this education program respond to the various findings.

Originally, OMH's mission emphasized six health problems identified by the Task Force as priority areas: cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke; chemical dependency; diabetes; homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries; and infant mortality and low birth weight. OMH added HIV infection to the six health prioty areas after epidemiologic data showed that the representation of blacks and Hispanics was disproportionately high among persons reported with AIDS. Strategies to eliminate or reduce high-risk behaviors associated with HIV infection need to mobilize racial and ethnic minority communities and rebuild social networks in order to foster sustained behavioral changes. OMH created the Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program to demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies to expand the activities of minority community-based and national organizations involved in HIV education and prevention, as well as to encourage innovative approaches to address appropriately the diversities within and among minority populations. In 1988, grants totalling \$1.4 million were awarded to four national and 23 community-based minority organizations. Project workers conduct information, education, and prevention interventions directed to specific groups within racial and ethnic minority communities. Interventions include education and prevention training, information activities, developing educational materials, and providing technical assistance. Project innovations include conducting HIV education and prevention training for families at home, presenting a play produced and performed by local teenagers, and developing a workshop and a manual to help minority service organizations to recruit and train volunteer staff members. Working with minority community-based and national organizations is an essential component of effective strategies for preventing HIV infection among racial and ethnic minorities. OMH's Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program encourages minority groups to participate as partners in Federal, State, and local HIV prevention efforts.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study examines immigrant Latinas' (ILs') help-seeking behaviors, types of support systems, and access to intimate partner violence (IPV) services during a global health crisis (COVID-19) at a community-based agency in a Northeastern state., Method: Nineteen immigrant Latinas who had prior IPV-related services such as legal aid, advocacy, and support within 1-3 years were recruited for the study. Spanish-speaking telephone interviews averaging between 30 and 45 min were conducted with each participant. Content analysis was the method employed to review the data and generate themes of the participants' experiences., Results: Participants' qualitative responses included an increase of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Types of support systems included reaching out to police departments, hospitals and health-care settings, and community-based agencies. Findings indicated a 47\% positive response rate when working with police officers (e.g., bilingual Spanish-English speaking police officers), and the participants reported being supported by the agency staff where they received services., Conclusion: Recommendations are provided to the community-based agency and other service providers regarding ongoing delivery of services and best practices for ILs throughout the pandemic transitions and beyond.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults are the fastest growing age group worldwide and in Canada. Immigrants represent a significant proportion of older Canadians. Social isolation is common among older adults and has many negative consequences, including limited community and civic participation, increased income insecurity, and increased risk of elder abuse. Additional factors such as the social, cultural, and economic changes that accompany migration, language differences, racism, and ageism heighten older immigrants' vulnerability to social isolation., OBJECTIVE: This mixed-methods sequential (qualitative-quantitative) study seeks to clarify older immigrants' social needs, networks, and support and how these shape their capacity, resilience, and independence in aging well in Ontario., METHODS: Theoretically, our research is informed by an intersectionality perspective and an ecological model, allowing us to critically examine the complexity surrounding multiple dimensions of social identity (eg, gender and immigration) and how these interrelate at the micro (individual and family), meso (community), and macro (societal) levels in diverse geographical settings. Methodologically, the project is guided by a collaborative, community-based, mixed-methods approach to engaging a range of stakeholders in Toronto, Ottawa, Waterloo, and London in generating knowledge. The 4 settings were strategically chosen for their diversity in the level of urbanization, size of community, and the number of immigrants and immigrant-serving organizations. Interviews will be conducted in Arabic, Mandarin, and Spanish with older women, older men, family members, community leaders, and service providers. The study protocol has received ethics approval from the 4 participating universities., RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative data collection is ongoing. The project is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada., CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analyses of qualitative and quantitative data within and across sites will provide insights about common and unique factors that contribute to the well-being of older immigrants in different regions of Ontario. Given the comprehensive approach to incorporating local knowledge and expert contributions from multilevel stakeholders, the empirical and theoretical findings will be highly relevant to our community partners, help facilitate practice change, and improve the well-being of older men and women in immigrant communities., INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/12616.

	abstract = {Background: Speech-language pathology services are among the most frequently accessed services for young autistic children. Therefore, understanding the nature of these services, what challenges these clinicians face, and what supports they value is critical for developing appropriate policies and practices that can maximize positive outcomes for children and families. This study had two primary aims. The first was to examine the self-reported assessment and intervention practices of community-based Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) and communicative disorders assistants (CDAs; who provide services under the supervision of a SLP) in supporting preschool children with suspected and diagnosed autism. The second aim was to identify barriers and supports (facilitators) to providing services in the community using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a framework., Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was used to collect qualitative and quantitative data from clinicians in Ontario Canada who were providing speech and language services to preschool children with suspected or diagnosed autism. Quantitative data were used to describe clinicians" practices, and qualitative data captured their perspectives on barriers and supports to providing services., Results: A total of 258 clinicians participated in the survey. On average, clinicians reported almost half of the preschoolers on their caseload had either diagnosed or suspected autism. There was consistency across the skill development areas assessed by SLPs, and targeted during therapy sessions, with the top four areas targeted being: foundational social communication, language, play and pragmatics. However, there was wide variation in speech and language assessment and intervention practices reported by this sample of clinicians (i.e., service delivery models, tools or programs used, length and duration of therapy services, level of collaboration with other professionals). Clinicians identified several barriers to providing services: limited funding and time, lack of inter-professional collaboration, difficulty accessing services, community messaging about autism services, family readiness and clinician knowledge. Supports (facilitators) included: access to autism-focused professional development, inter- and intra-professional collaboration, and access to additional supports in the community.

	abstract = {In the U.S., approximately half of maids and housekeeping cleaners are Latino or Hispanic, while the vast majority are women (88.3\%). This largely immigrant, underserved workforce faces complex factors, which may contribute to adverse health outcomes. To understand relevant barriers and challenges, this mixed-methods study explored the environmental health needs of a heterogeneous group of Latinas in New Jersey (NJ) who clean occupationally, and consisted of 3 focus groups (N = 15) with a cross-sectional survey (N = 9), both conducted in Spanish. Participants were recruited from community-based English as a Second Language classes in Hackensack, NJ. Analysis of focus group audio recordings included descriptive and in vivo coding followed by inductive coding to explore thematic analysis. The survey responses were evaluated using descriptive statistics. As per the survey results, the environmental health needs of this population include sore muscles, back problems, asthma, other respiratory issues, migraine or headache, and skin issues (rash, etc.). In the group discussions, the roles of genetics, food, and chemical exposures in cancer etiology were of great interest and a variety of opinions on the topic were explored. Both the focus group discussions and survey responses suggested that this population also faces barriers including lack of training, chemical exposures and inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE). These barriers are compounded by daily environmental exposures from personal home cleaning practices. The development of culturally- and linguistically-appropriate interventions are warranted to better protect the health of essential occupational cleaners who keep homes, businesses and schools clean.

	abstract = {Background: Research has shown that transgender and nonbinary people experience health disparities. However, few studies have explored, in-depth, the health-related experiences, perceptions, needs, and priorities of transgender women of color living in the U.S. South, a region that poses unique challenges to achieving health for transgender people. Aims: This study explored the social determinants of health, healthcare experiences, and health-related priorities of transgender women of color living in the U.S. South. Methods: Using a community-based participatory research approach, we conducted iterative in-depth interviews with 15 African American/Black and Latinx transgender women in North Carolina in May-July 2019 for a total of 30 interviews. We analyzed interview data using constant comparison, an approach to grounded theory. Results: Participants' mean age was 34 (range 19-56) years. Twenty themes emerged that were categorized into three domains: (1) social determinants of health (family rejection; bullying, discrimination, and violence; isolation; policy barriers; mistrust in systems; employment obstacles; sex work; high cost of care; transportation barriers; church antagonism; and substance misuse), (2) healthcare experiences (emotional burden of healthcare interactions; name and gender misidentification; staff discomfort and insensitivity; sexual risk assumptions; and use of nonmedical or predatory providers), and (3) health-related priorities (understanding healthcare; respect at all levels of healthcare; inclusive gender-affirming care; and comprehensive resources). Discussion: Transgender women of color living in the U.S. South face profound health barriers compounded throughout the life course and have unmet healthcare needs. Participants faced multilayered minority stressors: racial discrimination from society at large and within the LGTBQ community; gender identity discrimination within their regional context and racial/ethnic communities; and exclusion from existing health equity movements for transgender women of color, which often are found in and focus on larger urban communities. Health interventions mindful of this intersection are needed, including antidiscrimination policies and increasing gender-affirming healthcare access. Copyright Â© 2020 The Author(s).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: To test the feasibility and acceptability of a dementia literacy intervention for Korean American (KA) elders with dementia and their caregivers: K-PLAN (Preparing successful aging through dementia Literacy education And Navigation)., METHOD: Twenty cognitively impaired Korean elders (Clinical Dementia Rating 1+) and their caregivers participated in a pilot trial to receive the K-PLAN intervention, which consisted of 1-h dementia literacy education followed by monthly phone counseling sessions and navigation assistance for 3 months by a trained bilingual community health worker. Outcomes of interest were linkage to medical services for dementia evaluation (KA elders) and dementia literacy, social support, self-efficacy in dementia care, depression, and quality of life (caregivers). Using a one-group pre-and post-test design, all ten dyads were followed up at 12 weeks., RESULTS: The K-PLAN intervention was highly feasible and acceptable. We were able to retain all twenty participants over the study period (100\% retention rate). In addition, 100\% of the caregivers would recommend the program with an overall satisfaction rating of 9.7 on a 1-10-point scale. Three of the elders (30\%) were linked to medical services for dementia by medical record review. The effect sizes for caregiver outcomes ranged from 0.4 to 0.7 in absolute value., CONCLUSION: Dementia literacy intervention has the potential to promote linkage to medical services for dementia evaluation and early diagnosis among linguistically isolated KA elders while improving caregiver psychological outcomes. Studies with larger sample sizes, comparison groups, and cost-effective analyses are needed to inform the application of K-PLAN in diverse community settings., RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Early diagnosis of dementia can help preserve functional status. Promoting dementia literacy and linkage to health services through community-based programs such as K-PLAN may enable underserved racial/ethnic minority communities to make timely follow-up for dementia evaluation and care planning.

	abstract = {In an era of global climate change, intertwined with social and ecological predation, there is growing recognition of the importance of building socially, environmentally, culturally pluralistic, just and sustainable futures. Yet many of the calls for reform and discourses around sustainability are authored and defined through top-down approaches, by those who have power, privilege, and cognitive authority, and excludes the voices, identities, and epistemologies of those in the margins. In this paper we argue for the need to design and develop transformative learning ecologies that explicitly position the diverse voices of youth from nondominant communities as central to re-defining and re-envisioning relationally just, pluralistic, and sustainable futures. To this end, we seek to provide examples from participatory design-based learning ecologies to illustrate the centering of middle school youth voices and agencies from multilingual Black, Brown, and Latinx communities through critical response-ability. These examples highlight how these youth grapple with the uncertain landscapes of sustainability in their communities and provide counter-narratives to traditional deficit-based discourses and youth empowerment. We draw on what we have learned from multilingual youth to offer some suggestions for designing transformative learning ecologies situated within the framework of critical-response-ability in the quest for sustainable, thriving, and just futures.

	abstract = {Background: In Oregon in the United States' Pacific Northwest, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders including Micronesian Islanders (MI) substantially grew by 68\%; however, research is sparse. This is often due to data aggregation as Asian and Pacific Islanders and community members' reluctance and wariness to participate in research due to a history of unethical research in the Pacific. The MI community experienced miscarriages, stillbirths, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Organizational MI community leaders expressed a need to explore the voices of MI parent leaders (MIPLs). The purpose of the community-based participatory qualitative descriptive pilot study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of MIPLs with maternal and children's health, the school system, and the influence of culture. Methods: A trained MI community health worker recruited eight MIPLs from an urban area of the Pacific northwest in the United States. A group level assessment included illustrative storytelling and is a participant-driven qualitative method that guided data collection and analysis with real-time involvement with MIPL. The discussions lasted for 90 minutes. MIPL shared stories by writing and drawing pictures onto the flip chart papers, transcribed main points, and analyzed the data with researchers. Researchers recorded field notes of the interactions. Researchers debriefed with MIPL to assure trustworthiness and credibility of the findings. Findings: MIPL are Compact of Free Association citizens. Their age ranged from 26 to 42 years, have lived in the United States an average of 12.63 years, and most reported having less than \$15,000 total household income before taxes. Four main themes were identified: MI cultural identity, English language and MI culture disharmony, zero or delayed prenatal care, and uncertainty for the future of MI children who have disabilities or developmentally delayed as they progress through the school system. Conclusion:  Health care providers including nurses and school officials need to have a culturally specific understanding of the MI community and must consider their needs, culture, and language barriers.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in mental health treatment for people of color in the USA. Meeting the needs of those most burdened by this disparity will require swift and tactical action in partnership with these communities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a community-based participatory research approach was employed to assess the priorities and needs of four communities of color (African immigrant, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and Pacific Islander) in a major U.S. city. A brief quantitative survey devised jointly by community leaders and the research team was deployed to community members (N = 59) in the fall of 2020. The most endorsed mental health issues across the communities were excessive worry (51\%) and stress regarding COVID-19, racism, and immigration policies (49\%). The most endorsed physical health concerns included sleep difficulties (44\%), headaches, and backaches (each 39\%). Physical symptoms predicted the endorsement of a mental health issue above and beyond COVID-19-related hardships, multiplying the odds of reporting an issue by 1.73 per physical health concern endorsed. Based on these findings, the community-research team conceptualized and proposed an evidence-based, effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-2 intervention approach for chronic worry and daily stress. This paper highlights detail on how the community-research team arrived at the proposed multilevel intervention that addresses community-stated barriers to mental health treatment (e.g., preferring trusted health workers to deliver emotional health treatments) and considers the burden of the additional stressful context of COVID-19.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Integrating best practices for health disparities to adapt evidence-based treatments is imperative to adequately meet the needs of diverse cultures, particularly ones that therapists can apply flexibility across multiple diverse communities., METHOD: Using a mixed-methods, community-engaged approach, we examined how a range of community participants (N = 169) defined mental health, perceived barriers to treatment, and used culturally based coping methods to manage their mental health. Phase 1 (n = 49) included qualitative focus group data from five distinct racial/ethnic communities (African immigrants/refugees, Black/African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, and American Indians). Phase 2 included quantitative surveys from members of four of these communities (n = 59) and the frontline providers serving them (n = 61)., RESULTS: The communities and providers highlighted chronic worry and distress related to daily activities as primary treatment concerns. Further, this mixed-methods data informed our proposed best practice treatment adaptation framework using chronic worry as an example., CONCLUSION: The main aims of this study were to exemplify best practices for addressing mental health inequities in communities of color in terms of (a) conducting health disparities research and (b) applying a treatment adaptation framework for culturally responsive clinical care. Specific features of how this framework was conceived and applied provide a unique and critical view into integrating best practices to address health disparities in diverse communities.

We used descriptive statistics to summarize provider characteristics and survey responses and univariate analysis to determine associations between them., RESULTS: Fifteen surgeons and 19 surgical residents completed the survey (49\% response rate). Most respondents were aware of and had a positive attitude toward SDM (91\% and 76\%, respectively); 35\% reported having SDM training. Providers had varying levels of engagement with different SDM practices, and there were inconsistent associations between provider characteristics and the use of SDM. Often providers thought the patient's health literacy, foreign primary language, clinical condition, and socioeconomic factors were barriers to the SDM process., CONCLUSIONS: Although most general surgery faculty and residents at our institution had a positive view of SDM, they engaged in SDM behaviors inconsistently, with no clear association between clinician characteristics and specific behaviors. We identified several barriers to SDM consistent with those identified by providers in other specialties. This highlights the need for further research to study live general surgery provider-patient interactions, as well as structured SDM education to train general surgery providers to reliably engage their patients in effective SDM.

	abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Indigenous women continue to experience reproductive health inequities. While enhancing health literacy is suggested as an approach for reducing disparities and increasing equity, there is a paucity of literature exploring Indigenous women's conceptualisation of reproductive health literacy. This paper demonstrates one approach to developing a reproductive health literacy framework for Yolnu (Indigenous) women in a remote Northern Australian setting., METHODS: Using a decolonising participatory action research approach, a senior Yolnu researcher led interviews, group story sharing sessions, historic site visits and on-country cultural demonstration sessions with participants on reproductive health topics. Data were collected in the participants' first language(s) and occasionally in English. Data were digitally recorded on camera, Dictaphone, video and in handwritten notes. The senior Yolnu researcher worked with a Yolnu interpreter to translate the data into English. Data underwent a progressive verbal relational content analysis to map and build a framework., RESULTS: A reproductive health literacy framework that privileges Yolnu reproductive knowledge, practices and language was successfully co-designed. The framework was embedded in the metaphor of Pandanus mat and uses key cultural domains of Yolnu identity as a connecting foundation to women's reproductive knowledges and ceremonial milestones., CONCLUSIONS: The framework offers a culturally responsive and multilingual approach to sensitively discuss and operationalise reproductive health literacy. The framework empowers Yolnu cultural identities; accounts for both Yolnu and Western medical knowledges; and honours participants' requests for "Two-Way" learning. SO WHAT?: This research demonstrates an innovative approach to co-designing a culturally responsive framework for reproductive health literacy in a complex and multilingual context. Such approaches offer a promising way forward for empowering Indigenous women to define reproductive health literacy and contribute to improving their reproductive health outcomes.

	doi = {10.1002/hpja.407},
	abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Drowning is a global public health challenge with a need to ensure equity to drowning prevention information and interventions. In Australia, people born overseas are identified as being at greater risk of drowning. This paper presents findings from a community-based qualitative evaluation of swimming and water safety (SWS) programs delivered to adults from migrant backgrounds in Sydney, Australia., METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in November-December 2019 among 35 female participants of SWS programs targeted to adult migrants. While offered to all SWS program participants, no males took part in the study. Focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using a deductive approach. The domains of enquiry were guided by the health belief model and the theory of planned behaviour., RESULTS: Study participants were {\textgreater}=25 years, first generation and most had lived in Australia for {\textgreater}=10 years. Most were nonswimmers and were fearful of water prior to the program. Key themes were: direct SWS program outcomes, health and well-being; enablers and barriers to participation including: motivation, a program coordinator, fear and settlement priorities., CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that in order to increase SWS participation among migrant communities, the broader determinants of health need to be considered. Culturally appropriate strategies are required to enable both men and women equal opportunities to access SWS programs., SO WHAT: SWS programs provide multiple benefits for adult migrants; however, the impact on reducing inequities is limited, with broader multi-strategic health promotion approaches and policies required for inclusion and sustainability.

	abstract = {Introduction: Our study aimed to identify factors that influence access to eye care and eye health outcomes for remote Indigenous Australians living with diabetes., Methods: In collaboration with Indigenous Community-Based Researchers (CBR) and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS), a qualitative, participatory action research approach was taken, drawing on Indigenist and decolonising methodologies. The study was undertaken in four remote communities, in the Katherine region, Northern Territory and north-western New South Wales, Australia. Interviews and focus groups were undertaken with Indigenous adults aged {\textgreater}=40 years living with diabetes (n=110), and primary care clinicians working in ACCHSs (n=37). A series of interviews with CBRs (n=13) were undertaken before and after data collection to add cultural insights and validation to participant accounts. Data were analysed inductively using grounded theory, in-depth discussion and NVivo V.11., Results: More than one-third of all patients had little to no knowledge of how diabetes affects eye health. Limited access to health information and interpreters, language barriers, distrust of health providers and services, and limited cultural responsivity among non-Indigenous clinicians, were identified as determining factors in eye health and care., Discussion: We outline a need to address gaps in trust and communication, through increased access to and resourcing of Indigenous language interpreters and cultural brokers, understandable and culturally sensitive diabetic eye health information and cultural responsivity training for non-Indigenous clinicians. Centring Indigenous cultures in healthcare practice will enable a shared understanding between clinicians and Indigenous patients, and subsequently more equitable eye health outcomes.

We summarized retention strategies and examined contact, response, and participation rates over 5 years of annual follow-up interviews. We then evaluated motivations for participation and satisfaction with retention efforts among participants who completed a second in-person interview approximately 6 years after their baseline interview. Finally, we conducted logistic regression analyses estimating associations of demographic, health, and interview characteristics at study visit 1 (baseline) with participation, high motivation, and high satisfaction at visit 2. Across 5 years, the HCHS/SOL maintained contact, response, and participation rates over 80\%. The most difficult Hispanic/Latino populations to retain included young, single, US-born males with less than a high school education. At visit 2, we found high rates of motivation and satisfaction. HCHS/SOL participants primarily sought to help their community and learn more about their health. High rates of retention of Hispanics/Latinos can be facilitated through the employment of bilingual/bicultural staff and the development of culturally tailored retention materials.

Through focus groups with youth aged 14 to 22 (n = 13), community mapping was used to describe the youth-related mental health service transformation, followed by thematic analysis, validation by member checking and triangulation., RESULTS: Preliminary results show a generally successful implementation of the ACCESS Open Minds model, as evidenced by the transformation of mental health service provision, the enhancement of capacity in human resources and the participation of youth. Transformation was evidenced across the five objectives of mental healthcare of ACCESS Open Minds, albeit to variable extents. Several facilitating factors and challenges are identified based on youths' accounts., CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to successfully implement the ACCESS Open Minds model among francophones living in a minority setting and despite the constraints of a rural area. Most key components of the framework were implemented with high program fidelity. The rural context presents unique challenges that require creative and effective use of resources, while offering opportunities that arise from a culture of resourcefulness and collaboration.

An analysis of enrollment demographic characteristics from US preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 1988 through 2002 showed that enrollment of racial/ethnic minority groups increased. We analyzed enrollment in preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials from 2002 through 2016 and compared our data with data from the previous study, described demographic characteristics of trial participants, and assessed how well this distribution reflected the racial/ethnic distribution of new HIV diagnoses in the United States., METHODS: We examined data on demographic characteristics from 43 Phase 1 and Phase 2A preventive HIV vaccine clinical trials conducted in the United States and compared the results with those of the previous study. We also compared racial/ethnic distributions from 2011 through 2015 with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on the number of new HIV diagnoses during the same period., RESULTS: Of 3469 participants, 1134 (32.7\%) identified as a racial/ethnic minority, a 94\% increase from the previous period (634/3731; 17.0\%). Percentage annual enrollment of all racial/ethnic minority participants fluctuated from 17\% to 53\% from mid-2002 to 2016. Percentages of new HIV diagnoses among the general population were 1.9 to 2.9 times the percentage enrollment of black participants and 1.3 to 6.6 times the percentage enrollment of Hispanic/Latino participants in clinical trials for the same period., CONCLUSIONS: Although enrollment of racial/ethnic minority groups into HIV vaccine clinical trials has increased, it is not proportional to the number of new HIV diagnoses among these groups. To enhance recruitment of racial/ethnic minority groups, the HIV Vaccine Trials Network has prioritized community partnerships and invested resources into staff training.},

	doi = {10.1111/ajco.12818},
	abstract = {AIM: Clinical trials play a critical role in advancing cancer care, but international research shows that few cancer patients, particularly culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients, participate in trials. This limits generalizability of trial results and increases health disparities. This study aimed to establish rates and correlates of trial participation among CALD patients in South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD), a highly culturally diverse area., METHODS: Data from all cancer patients diagnosed and/or treated in SWSLHD from January 2006 to July 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The primary outcome was trial enrolment among patients born in non-English speaking countries (CALD) versus English speaking countries (non-CALD). Multivariable logistic regression evaluated CALD status as a predictor of trial participation. Moderators of trial participation by the different CALD groups, namely those whose preferred language was English (CALD-PLE) or was not English (CALD-PLNE), were examined by testing interactions between CALD status and other demographic and clinical variables., RESULTS: A total of 19 453 patients were analyzed (54.9\% non-CALD, 16.5\% CALD-PLE, 18.5\% CALD-PLNE). Overall, 7.4\% of patients were enrolled in a trial. Trial participation was significantly lower in CALD patients than non-CALD patients (5.7\% vs 8.4\%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.91; P = 0.001). CALD-PLNE patients were less likely to participate in trials than non-CALD (OR = 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.36-0.56; P {\textless} 0.0001) and CALD-PLE patients (OR = 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.41; P {\textless} 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Limited English proficiency seems particularly unfavorable to trial participation. Development and evaluation of strategies to overcome language barriers (e.g. simplified and translated multimedia participant information materials) is needed.

Interventions to improve health literacy have demonstrated moderate improvements in health service use. Most of these interventions focus on simplifying communication as opposed to navigation support. A comprehensive and multilevel response is required if the health care system and organizations are to be more responsive to different levels of health literacy. This includes obtaining feedback from patients on their experience of accessing health care. This study piloted the use of a co-design process to develop a culturally appropriate mechanism of elucidating the perspectives of community members of culturally diverse groups on their experiences of accessing a health service to identify the strengths and weaknesses of an organization's health literacy. This co-design process involved the adaptation of an existing "Walking Interview" tool to the location and language groups being targeted, as well as determining the process for recruiting participants and conducting the walking interviews. The interviews provided valuable insights into the experiences of culturally diverse groups in accessing Canterbury Hospital and identified areas for improvement, such as clearer signage and access to interpreter services.

This paper describes lessons learnt from developing culturally appropriate written information resources with and for Arabic, Italian, and Vietnamese cancer survivors and carers. The information needs of survivors from these language groups as well as guidelines for the development of written resources for culturally diverse populations were identified through literature review. Community consultation was undertaken with focus groups. The content was developed and tested with health professionals who spoke the appropriate language and focus group participants, ensuring relevance and appropriateness. Resource design and dissemination were informed through community consultation. A number of key tasks for developing resources were identified as follows: (1) community engagement and consultation; (2) culturally sensitive data collection; (3) focus group facilitators (recruitment and training); (4) content development; (5) translation and review process; (6) design; and (7) sustainability. This project reinforced literature review findings on the importance of cultural sensitivity in the development of resources. Engaging with community groups and incorporating culturally appropriate recruitment strategies optimises recruitment to focus groups and facilitates content development. Stakeholders and lay persons from the intended ethnic-minority communities should be involved in the development and formative evaluation of resources to ensure appropriateness and relevance and in the dissemination strategy to optimize penetration. We believe the lessons we have learnt will be relevant to any group intending to develop health information for culturally and linguistic diverse groups.},

Measurement of SDM and communication from the patient's perspective is necessary in order to ensure that health care systems and individual providers are responsive to patient views. However, there is a void of research addressing the psychometric properties of these measures with diverse patients, including non-English speakers, and in the context of behavioral health encounters. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of 2 patient-centered outcome measures, the Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-9 (SDM-Q) and the Kim Alliance Scale-Communication subscale (KAS-CM), in a sample of 239 English and Spanish-speaking behavioral health patients. One dominant factor was found for each scale and this structure was used to examine whether there was measurement invariance across the 2 language groups. One SDM-Q item was inconsistent with the configural invariance comparison and was removed. The remaining SDM-Q items exhibited strong invariance, meaning that item loadings and item means were similar across the 2 groups. The KAS-CM items had limited variability, with most respondents indicating high communication levels, and the invariance analysis was done on binary versions of the items. These had metric invariance (loadings the same over groups) but several items violated the strong invariance test. In both groups, the SDM-Q had high internal consistency, whereas the KAS-CM was only adequate. These findings help interpret results for individual patients, taking into account cultural and linguistic differences in how patients perceive SDM and patient-provider communication.

Sustainable, affordable strategies are required to achieve this, including strengthening of community-based interventions. Deployment of community-based health workers (CHWs) can improve health outcomes but there is a need to identify systems to support and maintain high-quality performance. Quality-improvement strategies have been successfully implemented to improve quality and coverage of healthcare in facilities and could provide a framework to support community-based interventions., METHODS: Four community-based quality-improvement projects from South Africa, Malawi and Mozambique are described. Community-based improvement teams linked to the facility-based health system participated in learning networks (modified Breakthrough Series), and used quality-improvement methods to improve process performance. Teams were guided by trained quality mentors who used local data to help nurses and CHWs identify gaps in service provision and test solutions. Learning network participants gathered at intervals to share progress and identify successful strategies for improvement., RESULTS: CHWs demonstrated understanding of quality-improvement concepts, tools and methods, and implemented quality-improvement projects successfully. Challenges of using quality-improvement approaches in community settings included adapting processes, particularly data reporting, to the education level and first language of community members., CONCLUSION: Quality-improvement techniques can be implemented by CHWs to improve outcomes in community settings but these approaches require adaptation and additional mentoring support to be successful. More research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach on processes and outcomes of care.},

We examined rates of successful contact, scheduling, and participation for studies that used the registry., RESULTS: Five studies queried 6,886 research registry members (48\% Hispanic and 38\% black) and attempted to contact 2,301 potentially eligible participants; eligibility criteria varied across studies. We successfully contacted 1,130 members, 51.9\% were scheduled to participate and of those, 60.8\% completed their study appointment. Non-Hispanic whites were less likely than Hispanics to be interested, but among those scheduling an appointment, participation did not differ by race/ethnicity., CONCLUSION: Community research registries are a feasible and efficient method for recruiting minority and underserved adults and may address disparities in access to and participation in health research.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive study was to explore the characteristics of herbal remedy use for diabetes among Latinos/Hispanics with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: A convenience sample of 75 Latino/Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes was recruited from community-based settings in North Carolina. Data were collected through face-to-face bilingual interviews. Measures included a demographic questionnaire; the Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Practices Questionnaire; and biophysical indicators of A1C and body mass index., RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of the sample reported using herbal remedies for diabetes self-care. Forty-nine herbal products were identified. The most commonly reported products were prickly pear cactus, aloe vera, celery, and chayote. The perceived effectiveness of products varied; some said they helped "a lot" while others noted the development of side effects. Over three quarters (77\%) of persons using herbal remedies reported concurrent use with prescribed medications. Also, some participants reported skipping or altering the dose of diabetes medications when using herbal remedies. Most (77\%) reported not disclosing herbal remedy use to health care providers., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes educators and other health care providers need to ask Latino/Hispanic clients about their use of herbal remedies and become knowledgeable about herbal products to provide advice about safety.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the immigrant Latino/a transgender community in the southeastern United States. This study used photovoice, a methodology aligned with community-based participatory research, to explore needs, assets, and priorities of Latina transgender women in North Carolina. Nine immigrant Latina male-to-female transgender women documented their daily experiences through photography, engaged in empowerment-based photo-discussions, and organized a bilingual community forum to move knowledge to action. From the participants' photographs and words, 11 themes emerged in three domains: daily challenges (e.g., health risks, uncertainty about the future, discrimination, and anxiety about family reactions); needs and priorities (e.g., health and social services, emotional support, and collective action); and community strengths and assets (e.g., supportive individuals and institutions, wisdom through lived experiences, and personal and professional goals). At the community forum, 60 influential advocates, including Latina transgender women, representatives from community-based organizations, health and social service providers, and law enforcement, reviewed findings and identified ten recommended actions. Overall, photovoice served to obtain rich qualitative insight into the lived experiences of Latina transgender women that was then shared with local leaders and agencies to help address priorities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This project addresses low levels of awareness and use of palliative care among ten culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities in Melbourne, Australia., AIM: To increase awareness, understanding and use of palliative care among the Arabic speaking, Chinese, Croatian, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Maltese, Polish, Turkish and Vietnamese communities in Melbourne and to strengthen the provision of culturally responsive palliative care., METHOD: In July 2013 the palliative care and ethnic peak bodies initiated a two-year project with 10 ethnic communities (5 per year) to deliver peer education sessions about palliative care in community languages. Adjunct activities include community engagement, relationship-building, media, cultural responsiveness education for palliative care services, and evaluation., RESULTS: As at mid-July 2014, feedback from 837 participants (80\% of 1050 attendees) at 37 community education sessions for 4 CALD communities indicated that 68\% did not know about palliative care before the session. 90\% had learnt new information, 90\% had an intention to tell friends and family about palliative care and 90\% thought palliative care was a good idea. Updated results will be provided., CONCLUSION: Participatory and engagement strategies are needed to improve awareness of palliative care among CALD communities. The formation of community reference groups is a valuable strategy that respects community leadership, expertise and networks. The participation of CALD communities in tailoring education and information to meet specific cultural, spiritual and linguistic needs is essential. The participation of palliative care services in project activities is valued and strengthens relationships of trust and understanding.

	volume = {4},
	doi = {10.2196/resprot.3838},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the kidney shortage continues to grow, patients on the waitlist are increasingly turning to live kidney donors for transplantation. Despite having a disproportionately higher prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), fewer waitlisted Hispanic patients received living donor kidney transplants (LDKTs) than non-Hispanic whites in 2014. Although lack of knowledge has been identified as a barrier to living kidney donation (LKD) among Hispanics, little is known about information needs, and few bilingual educational resources provide transplant-related information addressing Hispanics' specific concerns., OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the process of developing a bilingual website targeted to the Hispanic community. The website was designed to increase knowledge about LKD among Hispanic patients with ESKD, their families, and the public, and was inspired by educational sessions targeted to Hispanic transplant patients provided by Northwestern University's Hispanic Kidney Transplant Program., METHODS: Northwestern faculty partnered with the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois for expertise in ESKD and Hispanic community partners across the Chicago area. We established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) of 10 Chicago-area Hispanic community leaders to provide insight into cultural concerns and community and patients' needs. Website content development was informed by 9 focus groups with 76 adult Hispanic kidney transplant recipients, living kidney donors, dialysis patients, and the general Hispanic public. The website development effort was guided by community input on images, telenovela scripts, and messages. After initial development, formal usability testing was conducted with 18 adult Hispanic kidney transplant recipients, dialysis patients, and living kidney donors to identify ways to improve navigability, design, content, comprehension, and cultural sensitivity. Usability testing revealed consistently high ratings as "easy to navigate", "informative", and "culturally appropriate". Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and Gagne's Conditions of Learning Theory guided website design to facilitate adult learning., RESULTS: The website, "Informate: Living Kidney Donation for Hispanics/Latinos" (Informate Acerca de la Donacion de Rinon en Vida), includes six sections: Treatment Options, Donation: Step-by-Step, Benefits and Risks, Financial Issues, Immigrant Issues, and Cultural Beliefs and Myths. Sections host 5-10 interactive messages that summarize important points and link to detailed explanations for users interested in learning more about specific issues. The website hosts interactive videos, multimedia testimonials, telenovelas, games, and quizzes. Photographs and videos of Hispanic living donors are shown to promote pride and ownership., CONCLUSIONS: Our success in developing a website was driven by a development team with expertise in transplantation, social science, evaluation, instructional design, and Hispanic perspectives, and by a patient-centered approach toward content and design. Based on feedback from usability testing and our CAB, the website is sensitive to Hispanic cultural sensibilities. We have nearly completed a formal evaluation of the website's impact on increasing Hispanics' knowledge about LKD and will disseminate the website thereafter.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {The role of alcohol in the transmission of HIV and access to health services for persons living with HIV/AIDS is relatively unexamined across the globe. Our team's community-based, mixed methods study examined both of these questions from the perspectives of Aboriginal persons living in Canada with HIV/AIDS (APHA) and service providers (SP). A bilingual national survey was undertaken with APHAs and SPs and the findings were followed up on in peer interviews. A complex relationship was identified between alcohol use, perceptions of alcohol use and access to services. Nearly half of APHAs surveyed reported that alcohol played a role in their becoming HIV positive. APHAs and SPs differed in their assessment of the impact of alcohol in the lives of Aboriginal persons once diagnosed, with a far greater proportion of SPs identifying it as problematic. Both SPs and APHAs associated the misuse of alcohol with diminished health. Nearly half of the APHAs surveyed shared they had been told they were drinking by a SP when they were not, while over one-third reported ever being denied services because of drinking when in fact they were not. Both SPs and APHAs identified physical health and discrimination as key reasons. Notwithstanding these results that point to shortcomings in service provision, the data also reveal that most APHAs are recieving care in which their choices are respected and from providers they trust. The findings point to the need for a nuanced strategy to solidify the strengths and address the shortcomings in APHA's service provision.},

Targeted care and prevention programs are urgently needed., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Within an overall goal of revealing health disparities, the questionnaire explored (1) the use of and access to healthcare, (2) the factors affecting quality of life, and (3) the levels of provider-patient communication., METHODS: A New York City musculoskeletal hospital conducted a community health needs survey among its diverse ethnic/racial communities. A 39-item questionnaire was administered online, by mail, and in person (in English, Spanish, and Chinese). Answers were analyzed in terms of sociodemographics, to define health disparities within a total sample and two subsamples., RESULTS: In the total sample, respondents were 60\% White, 16\% Black, 14\% Hispanic/Latino, and 11\% Asian, mostly female, and aged 50 to 79. More than 17\% of the total sample indicated they could not access a healthcare provider when needed. Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity were large areas of concern, as were falls and poor self-reported health status. Nearly all respondents said they took steps to communicate with their healthcare providers. Dramatic health disparities were found between Whites and non-Whites (e.g., non-Whites were most likely to rate their health poorly, consider their diet fair or poor, lack health insurance, and be unable to access a healthcare provider)., CONCLUSION: The findings are being used to further refine, develop, and expand the hospital's community programs, especially for culturally diverse and underserved communities.},

	abstract = {Migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the United States are now overwhelmingly immigrants from Mexico. Pesticide exposure among these farmworkers is a major occupational health concern; however, little research has considered the agricultural pesticide use and safety experiences of these workers in their communities of origin. This analysis uses survey data collected by the PACE project to delineate the farming and pesticide use experiences of Mexican-born farmworkers in North Carolina. Over 80 percent of the 277 Mexican-born farmworkers had done agricultural work in Mexico, including work on their own farms (93\%) and as hired farm labor (35\%). Almost two-thirds of those farmworkers with farming experience had used pesticides, but only about one-third of those who used pesticides had received pesticide safety training or information. Most of those who used pesticides had used some form of safety equipment. Those who had worked as hired farm labor in Mexico were more likely to have used pesticides and safety equipment, and to have received safety training and information. Those who spoke an indigenous language at home rather than Spanish were less likely to have used pesticides and to have received safety training and information. These results demonstrate that farmworkers coming to the U.S. from Mexico arrive with a variety of experiences with pesticide usage and pesticide safety training. Such experiences form the framework within which farmworkers understand the relationship of pesticide usage to human health. It is important for occupational health and safety programs directed to farmworkers in the U.S. to consider the experiences these workers bring from their communities of origin.},

Participants ' ages ranged from 18 to 73 years. Half were born in the continental United States, and half were born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. All were sexually active within the past 90 days with a male partner. The authors compared sociodemographic characteristics, experience of intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV sexual risk factors (number of partners, history of sexually transmitted infections [STIs],condom use, and so on). Multiple regression analyses considering sociodemographic characteristics were a predictor for IPV and sexual risk behaviors. The authors found differences in sexual risk behaviors by place of birth (continental United States versus Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) and language chosen for the interview (Spanish or English). Puerto Rican women reported fewer sexual partners and STIs. Mainland-born and English-preference women reported more IPV, risky partners, and condom use. Birth in the continental United States and preference for English appear to be indicators of greater risk for IPV, risky sexual practices, and risky partners. HIV prevention intervention strategies for Puerto Rican women must address differences in heterosexual risk according to language and place of birth.},

	abstract = {We conducted a qualitative study employing structured interviews with 38 community health workers, known as health promoters, from twelve rural municipalities of Chiapas, Mexico in order to characterize their work and identify aspects of their services that would be applicable to community-based tuberculosis (TB) control programs. Health promoters self-identify as being of Mayan Indian ethnicity. Most are bilingual, speaking Spanish and one of four indigenous Mayan languages native to Chiapas. They volunteer 11 h each week to conduct clinical and public health work in their communities. Over half (53\%) work with a botiquin, a medicine cabinet stocked with essential medicines. Fifty-three percent identify TB as a major problem affecting the health of their communities, with one-fifth (21\%) of promoters reporting experience caring for patients with known or suspected TB and 29\% having attended to patients with hemoptysis. One-third of health promoters have access to antibiotics (32\%) and one-half have experience with their administration; 55\% complement their biomedical treatments with traditional Mayan medicinal plant therapies in caring for their patients. We describe how health promoters employ both traditional and allopathic medicine to treat the symptoms and diseases they encounter most frequently which include fever, diarrhea, and parasitic infections. We contend that given the complex sociopolitical climate in Chiapas and the state's unwavering TB epidemic and paucity of health care infrastructure in rural areas, efforts to implement comprehensive, community-based TB control would benefit from employing the services of health promoters.},

A total of 380 hypertensive Korean American persons from the Baltimore/Washington area were assigned to a more intense in-class education group or a less intensive mail education group. Evaluation of postintervention blood pressure (BP) outcomes revealed that significant reductions in systolic BP (13.3 mm Hg and 16.1 mm Hg, respectively) and diastolic BP (9.5 mm Hg and 10.9 mm Hg) and increases in BP control rates (42.3\% and 54.3\%) were achieved in both groups.

The Network focused on 5 significant cancers: breast, cervical, lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer. The Steering Committee initiated a review process for junior researchers that resulted in 5 NCI-funded pilot projects. Pilot projects were conducted with various Latino populations. The Network developed community education and health promotion projects including the bilingual outreach play The Cancer Monologues. The Network's partnership also started and held 2 annual health fairs, Dia de la Mujer Latina/Day of the Latina Woman, and annual health prevention summits. The Special Population Network (SPN) adapted and revised a clinical trials education outreach module that reached Network community partners. SPN partners recruited Latino/a students to cancer research through a6-week NCI training program held yearly at the UCHSC campus.

The Seattle regional Asian American Network for Cancer, Awareness, Research, and Training (AANCART) site has implemented a community-based cancer awareness program for Cambodian immigrants in collaboration with a Cambodian community coalition. Our cancer awareness program has the following goals: to assist individuals and organizations in advocating for a healthy community, to provide information within a cultural context, and to deliver information in ways that are useful and meaningful to the community. The program was guided by a community assessment that included the use of published data as well as information from qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative surveys. Examples of community awareness activities include group presentations at community-based organizations (e.g., during English as a second language classes), health fair participation (including at nontraditional venues such as a farmers' market serving Cambodians), and educational displays in neighborhood locations (e.g., at Cambodian video stores). In addition, the Seattle AANCART site has both inventoried and developed culturally appropriate Khmer language cancer education materials and disseminated materials through the ETHNO-MED website. Our approach recognizes that limited English language proficiency may preclude many Cambodians from understanding publicly disseminated information, and Cambodian immigrants are often isolated and tend to stay close to their own neighborhoods.

The aim of the parent study is to evaluate whether the BART intervention is more effective than a control condition in reducing HIV risk behavior in the target population. The project explores how self-efficacy, behavioral intentions, social factors and acculturation influence the risk behavior of Haitian American adolescents. This community based translation of a risk reduction intervention, previously found to be effective in other populations, can serve as a model for reducing health disparities in a vulnerable adolescent population that lacks access to preventive health care. The purpose of this paper is to present preliminary data from the pre-assessment phase of the intervention, which enabled the project to incorporate health disparity issues with this population and address barriers to health care access.},

	abstract = {During the last 25 years, numerous studies have been conducted to promote breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. Most of these studies focused on individual-level factors predicting screening, but we are unaware of any that directly examined community and ecological influences. The goal of this project, Promoting Access to Health for Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian Women (PATH for Women), was to increase community capacity for breast and cervical cancer screening and follow up in Los Angeles and Orange counties. We focused on Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women because, although they have the lowest rates for cancer, compared to all other ethnic groups, relatively few programs have specifically targeted Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women to promote and sustain screening practices. The PATH for Women project involved a partnership between 5 community-based organizations and 2 universities, and included 7 Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities: Cambodians, Chamorros, Laotians, Thais, Tongans, Samoans, and Vietnamese. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing a Geographic Information System (GIS)-mapping evaluation component that was used to explore availability and accessibility to culturally responsive breast and cervical cancer screening services for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women in all 7 communities. We describe the methods used to develop the maps, and present the preliminary findings that demonstrate significant geographic and language barriers to accessing healthcare providers, services for breast and cervical cancer screening, and follow up, in each of the communities. Finally, we discuss implications for programs designed to promote breast and cervical screening and policy education.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This paper explores South Asian patients' views and experiences of clinical trial participation, as part of a larger study which sought to assess British South Asian under-representation in clinical trials., METHODS: The study was based on semi-structured interviews with South Asian trial participants in primary care and specialist treatment centres in the north of England. Fifteen South Asian patients who had participated in one of six different clinical trials to test pharmaceutical products comprised the study cohort., RESULTS: South Asian motivations to participate in clinical trials are similar to those of the majority 'White' population. Clear and concise trial information (provided by caring and understanding trial staff) was considered an important aspect of the respondents' experiences. Appealing to South Asian peoples' altruistic nature by making them aware of South Asian under-representation (especially in clinical trials that investigate illnesses prevalent in their community) was also identified as a strong motivational factor. Potential barriers to their participation included: trial burden (which bears heavily on the poor), language, and discriminatory practices in the NHS, which can lead to mistrust of health professionals. In addition, female modesty and preference for female trial staff was recognized as a 'cultural' barrier to participation., CONCLUSION: There are more similarities than differences between the experiences of British South Asians and 'White' trial participants. Present findings suggest that ethnicity operates at different levels. In addition to South Asian trial participants' culture, social class and gender are also as likely to affect their participation in clinical trials. To improve South Asian accrual rates, strategies should be designed to take into consideration linguistic differences and improving overall trust in the clinical trial team.},

However, little is known about their perspectives on health care quality., OBJECTIVE: To examine factors contributing to quality of care from the perspective of Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients with limited English language skills., DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups and content analysis to determine domains of quality of care., SETTING: Four community health centers in Massachusetts., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 122 Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients were interviewed in focus groups by bilingual interviewers using a standardized, translated moderator guide., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Domains of quality of care mentioned by patients in verbatim transcripts., RESULTS: In addition to dimensions of health care quality commonly expressed by Caucasian, English-speaking patients in the United States, Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients with limited English proficiency wanted to discuss the use of non-Western medical practices with their providers, but encountered significant barriers. They viewed providers' knowledge, inquiry, and nonjudgmental acceptance of traditional Asian medical beliefs and practices as part of quality care. Patients also considered the quality of interpreter services to be very important. They preferred using professional interpreters rather than family members, and preferred gender-concordant translators. Furthermore, they expressed the need for help in navigating health care systems and obtaining support services., CONCLUSIONS: Cultural and linguistically appropriate health care services may lead to improved health care quality for Asian-American patients who have limited English language skills. Important aspects of quality include providers' respect for traditional health beliefs and practices, access to professional interpreters, and assistance in obtaining social services.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This is a preliminary report from a research collaboration between Asian Health Services (community health center); Koreans in Alameda County, California; and the University of California at Berkeley School of Public Health. This five-year Centers for Disease Control and Prevention project supports a collaborative community intervention to improve breast and cervical cancer screening behavior among Korean women., METHODS: A Korean Community Advisory Board and Korean-American staff were recruited, and community sensitive research (CSR) and participatory action research (PAR) principles were applied: (1) building community infrastructure for sustainable action, (2) cultural appropriateness, (3) assuring responsiveness to community needs, and (4) a prevention focus that would assist health care providers. We conducted a population-based telephone survey on 676 Korean adults (272 men and 404 women)., RESULTS: The collaborative process yielded (1) a high response rate (79\%), (2) baseline health information on Korean Americans, (3) broadening of the original research topic, (4) survey responses that will guide intervention design, (5) culturally competent strategies, and (6) expanded Korean-American Community capacity for local action., CONCLUSIONS: Research collaboration between universities, community-based organizations, and ethnic communities can yield high-quality research. CSR and PAR approaches help break through cultural barriers in otherwise "hard to reach" API sub-populations. Determinants of success include sharing common goals; trust, honesty, and integrity; shared decision making; mutual respect of each partner's expertise; cultural sensitivity and cultural competence; flexibility, good communication, and mutual learning; and continuity of partners. Actively engaging members of the study population in the research process builds community capacity, thus laying the foundation for future projects that improve health status.},

The variables included age, sex, education level, and social status. The reason for non-attendance was also recorded., RESULTS: A total of 3271 (83\%) eligible residents from the 9 sample areas were screened; 46\% males and 54\% females. Language spoken at home was significantly associated with participation. Residents whose main language at home was not English were less likely to attend the screening centre. (OR: 0.60; CI: 0.44-0.81). The main reasons given for non-attendance by eligible residents were lack of interest (6\%), too busy to attend (4\%), personal illness (2\%), and attend own eye specialist (2\%)., CONCLUSION: We believe these results will not impact significantly on the interpretation of gender and age-specific data from the Melbourne VIP.},

Latinx communities in non-traditional migration areas may experience greater baseline day-to-day challenges such as a lack of resources for immigrants and insufficient language services. These challenges may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This article describes the results of an initial community health needs assessment to better understand the prevention and care of COVID-19 infection in the Cincinnati Latinx community. Methods: We used convergent mixed methods to examine barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 prevention and care for those with infection. Results: Latinx adults â¥ 18 years old completed 255 quantitative surveys and 17 qualitative interviews. Overarching mixed methods domains included knowledge, prevention, work, challenges, and treatment. Quantitative results largely reinforced qualitative results (confirmation). Certain quantitative and qualitative results, however, diverged and expanded insights related to caring for COVID-19 infection among Latinx adults (expansion). There were infrequent contradictions between quantitative and qualitative findings (discordance). Primary barriers for the Latinx community during the COVID-19 pandemic included insecurities in food, jobs, housing, and immigration. Key facilitators included having trusted messengers of health-related information. Conclusion: Public health interventions should be centered on community partnerships and the use of trusted messengers. Wraparound services (including resources for immigrants) are essential public health services. Close partnership with employers is essential as lack of sick leave and mask supplies were more frequent barriers than knowledge. These findings emerged from experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic but likely generalize to future public health crises.},

Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been useful in developing interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Specifically, partnership with the target group members has resulted in more culturally relevant intervention strategies. Aim: The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the existing research on sexual health interventions targeting U.S. REMs that were developed using CBPR, to highlight the role target group members played in the development of these interventions, and to explore the benefits and outcomes of these partnerships. Method: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the search of 46 thesauri terms for CBPR, sexual health, and REMs across six databases. Results: The initial search yielded 805 identified studies. After applying limiters, reviewing abstracts, and doing a full-text review, 24 appropriate studies were retained. The key findings indicated significant intervention outcomes such as increased health knowledge, attitude change, and behavioral intention that could reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors. Twelve studies detailed the methods for partnering with target group members to formulate interventions, highlighting the benefits related to recruitment, retention, and cultural relevance. Discussion: CBPR is well-positioned to address sexual health disparities among REMs. While community partnership strategies vary, the findings yield evidence that CBPR addressing sexual health disparities is achievable, can influence the effectiveness of interventions, and should be considered as an orientation in future sexual health research.},

First Nations, Culturally and Linguistically diverse, Young parents and Maori and Pacific Island women are offered continuity of midwifery care and wrap around services into the first 2000 days of life. The service (The Hubs) now provide care for approximately 28\% of the birthing population of the area (3). This model is an innovation in co -design with impacts observed attributable to a collective impact framework (4). Importantly 'The Hubs' have external cross sector and community governance that continues to provide avenues for collective impact. Preliminary data demonstrate superior short-term health outcomes for mothers and babies when compared to standard care in the Logan priority populations catchment area (1-3). Long-term effects of this model of care on the health of the Logan community is unknown. Whilst increased numbers of childbearing women are accessing care through the Hubs, there is still a cohort of priority populations who are not engaging. This presentation describes the Hubs, including the community governance principles that are essential to embed cultural safety and sustainability. It presents an overview of the current project which aims to identify what is working well and what can be improved to engage those families who are not accessing care. This includes development of a framework for place-based community led action for collective impact and provision of baseline data for long-term evaluation strategies of paediatric development and behavioural outcomes in Logan over the program's lifespan (5). The presentation will highlight the pivotal role of the community in the project team and service provision and provide insights for implementing and scaling this community-led innovation in other areas.},

Active and Healthy Families, a Spanish-language, culturally tailored group visit intervention has demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing child body mass index but does not address barriers to frequent engagement with the health care system nor social determinants other than immigration. Adapting the intervention for community-based delivery, and to address additional social determinants, may facilitate participation and increase acceptability and engagement among Latinx immigrant families. Purpose: To engage a stakeholder network in planning adaptations of an evidence-based weight management intervention for community-based implementation. Method: Guided by the intervention mapping-adapt process, we solicited feedback from a stakeholder network from August 2018 to March 2020. The stakeholder network assessed fit, planned adaptations and identified essential intervention components using photovoice, a Participatory Action Research method, and meetings incorporating user-centered design approaches. Results: The stakeholder network membership included Latinx immigrant families, community leaders, health care delivery experts, and researchers. Planned adaptations included curriculum changes to discuss social determinants barriers to behavior change and goal setting to mitigate them. Conclusions: We successfully engaged a stakeholder network and, using a systematic process, identified adaptations of an evidence-based weight management intervention to allow for community-based implementation. Sustainably addressing obesity disparities for Latinx children also requires addressing structural factors to reduce social determinants of health barriers at the population level.},

	abstract = {Traditional nonâparticipatory research methodologies have struggled to address the needs of multicultural populations in the United States (U.S.). Communityâbased participatory research (CBPR) is a research paradigm offering a unique opportunity for culturally appropriate research and improving health equity. CBPR is an equitable, strengthâbased approach involving all stakeholders throughout the research process. We investigate the field of psychology's utilization of CBPR as an approach for working with multicultural populations to collaboratively address relevant and impactful research questions. A total of 1912 CBPRârelated articles, from 2004 to 2014, were identified using PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL Complete databases. Of these, approximately 16\% (n = 311) met our criteria for psychologyârelated CBPR articles accounting for a negligible amount ({\textless}1\%) of peerâreviewed publications in mainstream psychological journals during the same time period. Among U.S. psychologyârelated CBPR articles, 86\% focused on multicultural and marginalized populations. Prominent topics of investigation included physical health, mental and behavioral health, and theoretical or methodological articles. Features of publications, including authors' training, types of journals, study populations, and topics under investigation, were explored for all 1912 publications. Findings highlight an opportunity for further utilization of CBPR within psychology, with key implications for health equity. Recommendations for increasing CBPR uptake within the discipline are also offered. Highlights: We examine the field of psychology's utilization of CBPR and review 1912 CBPR articles.Approximately 16\% of manuscripts (n = 311) met our criteria for psychologyârelated CBPR articles.Of these, only 21\% were published in mainstream psychology journals.Racial/ethnic and marginalized communities account for 85\% of all U.S. CBPRârelated study samples.Additional efforts could increase the use of CBPR within the field of psychology.},

	abstract = {Hispanic and Latino (HL) cancer survivors are at a critical disadvantage compared with nonâHispanic White (NHW) patients regarding sociodemographic adversities and access to equitable treatment options. By 2030, there will be about four million HL cancer survivors in the U.S., representing nearly 20\% of survivors in this country. Hispanics and Latinos are subjected to significant challenges in accessing and receiving equitable care relative to NHWs. Hispanics and Latinos also experience lower rates of health insurance and financial resources, limiting health care options. These disparities often originate from disparate social determinants of health, including lower funding for education and school programs, greater neighborhood stressors and violence, lower access to healthy and affordable food, and greater barriers to community health and exercise opportunities. Even among HL cancer survivors with proper access to health care, they experience disparate treatment options, including low inclusion in clinical trials and/or access to experimental therapies. A solution to these barriers necessitates complex and systemic changes that involve, for example, investing in public health programs, increasing the diversity and cultural awareness of the medical workforce, and promoting research opportunities such as clinical trials that are inclusive of HLs. Only through meaningful reform will equitable cancer care be available for all in the U.S. regardless of racial and/or ethnic background. This article reviews some of the critical social determinants of health and biases relevant to HL cancer survivors and provides recommendations for achieving cancer health equity. Implications for Practice: Hispanics and Latinos experience a significant and often disproportionate cancerârelated burden compared with nonâHispanic and Latino White individuals and other racial and ethnic groups. Meaningful reform to achieve health equity in oncology should focus on approaches to gaining trust among diverse patients, cultural and community sensitivity and engagement in oncology care and research, diversifying the workforce, and improving inclusion in clinical trial participation. Taken together, these recommendations can lead to exemplary and equitable care for all patients. This article examines the contextual and systemic factors that contribute to and exacerbate disparities in cancer care for Hispanic and Latino cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Group-based physical activity (PA) in community-based settings represents a promising avenue for promoting healthy ageing, however, lower levels of adherence have been found to be associated with aspects of social disadvantage. Providers are in a key position to provide important insights about strategies to improve adherence, however, few studies have examined their perspectives. In this study, 30 community service providers were interviewed, and 42 older people participated in focus groups to identify actions perceived as effective for promoting adherence to organised PA, with a focus on factors relevant to older people experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, social isolation, living with a disability or from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Data were analysed thematically. Adherence barriers included deteriorating health, lack of belonging and loss of motivation. Helpful strategies for addressing deteriorating health included maintaining programme flexibility, facilitating access to health and other services, and supporting participants to adapt to acquired limitations. Belonging can be fostered by creating positive and inclusive experiences, ensuring safe and stigma-free environments, providing opportunities to forge personal connections and demonstrating care. Motivation may be enhanced by ensuring activities are of interest and functional benefit, programme settings are suitable and appealing, and enjoyment is prioritised. In conclusion, a range of strategies is likely to be necessary to mitigate risks to adherence and support continued participation in organised PA among socially disadvantaged older people.},

Through a collaboration of food bank, university, and hospital community outreach partners, NPM offers fresh, free produce and nutrition education with food samples to families at risk of food insecurity. Since its inception in 2017, NPM has served over 300 families and 500 children in 20 neighborhoods. Four phases informed by collaborative partners with assistance from Spanish and Arabic interpreters/translators: 16 interviews to inform survey development; survey development with closed- and open-ended items and testing; survey translation and testing; and survey data collection using Qualtrics. Content analysis and descriptive statistics conducted for interview and survey data, respectively. Among interviewees (14 females; 2 males), half of the interviews were conducted in English, 31\% in Spanish, and 19\% in Arabic. Major themes categorized by benefits, impact on family fruit and vegetable intake, food access norms, and suggestions. Survey completed by 40 participants (34 females; 6 males) in Spanish (40\%), Arabic (32\%), English (28\%). Over 95\% reported NPM connected people in the communities and had a positive impact on physical or financial health of families. Most respondents (97\%) were introduced to new foods, with 80\% reporting their children tried new foods. Over 85\% reported they and their household members ate more fresh vegetables due to the NPM. Only 11\% reported being uncomfortable getting food from the NPM. Suggestions included marketing, accessibility, and variety/quantity of foods. There may be benefits to using a mobile fresh food pantry model like NPM for multilingual communities. Findings may be useful to nutrition educators to meet participant fruit and vegetable needs in similar communities.},

Participatory studies provide relevant knowledge to better inform future nutrition interventions. We conducted a participatory Photovoice project in which residents interpreted the influence of the local food environment on eating behaviors across three neighborhoods of contrasting area-level socioeconomic status (SES) in Bilbao, Spain. From April to July 2017, a total of 23 residents participated in the three Photovoice groups. Each group critically discussed their photographs (NÂ =Â 110) in groups of 6-9 participants along six group sessions. Through a consensus-building process, participants identified 27 emerging categories choosing finally 39 related photographs, which followed six conceptual main themes characterizing their local food environment: 1) unhealthy eating behaviors, 2) cultural diversity, 3) retail transformation, 4) social relationships, 5) precariousness, and 6) healthy eating. Although high food quality and fresh products may portray a general healthy food environment in all three neighborhoods, participants discussed why some residents still adopt unhealthy eating behaviors characterized by an excessive consumption of alcohol (high-SES area), sugar loaded foods (high- and middle-SES) and fast food (middle and low-SES). This photovoice participatory methodology helps highlighting important similarities and differences regarding food environment perceptions in the whole socioeconomic spectrum of any given city. This type of participatory approach helps guiding local policies and interventions promoting healthier local food environments.},

	abstract = {Reflexivity, an important component of qualitative inquiry generally, gains additional significance in community-based participatory research (CBPR). The varying partnerships among researchers, community partners, and community members are strengthened when a co â learning, reflective model is applied. The use of reflective field notes can be a powerful tool to help achieve this end. In this article, we describe the dynamics of community-engaged research team where members applied a co-learning model to reflect upon their positionality in the community and in research. Using reflective field notes examined through a narrative approach to the PI's time in the field, we assess these positionalities through the relationships between CBPR work and power relations. The reflective practice embedded in the CBPR process brought these power relations to our attention. We then turned to the literature on power relations to better understand what was occurring in the study. The current case details the additional complexity that occurs when issues of language, translation, gender, and culture are introduced. Thus, this paper is a reflective analysis of a bilingual researcher's experience in the field specific to cross-cultural CBPR work.},

Due to social, cultural, and linguistic barriers, culturally sensitive care is largely unavailable for Chinese Americans, and their psychological needs are not often addressed. We aimed to investigate whether the Joy Luck Academy (JLA), a psychosocial intervention providing both information and peer support, was associated with positive adjustment among Chinese American breast cancer survivors. Thirty-nine Chinese American breast cancer survivors participated in a pilot psychosocial intervention. The educational materials and lectures were delivered in the participants' native language of Chinese. All of the educators and mentors shared the same linguistic and cultural background with the participants. The program utilized a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to further enhance the cultural sensitivity of the intervention. Participants' post-traumatic growth and positive affect were assessed before and after the intervention. The JLA showed an improvement in positive affect, and they had a greater appreciation for life. The intervention was found to be feasible, well-accepted, and beneficial for this population. Chinese American breast cancer survivors reported improved psychological health after attending the intervention. These findings encourage the development and implementation of psychosocial interventions for Chinese breast cancer survivors. Similar programs could be integrated into other ethnic or cultural communities.},

Evidence supports prevention of obesity and related diseases through nutrition education and lifestyle interventions delivered by paraprofessionals. This study examined cultural competency characteristics and cultural knowledge of paraprofessionals delivering a nutrition education intervention to low-income Hispanics/Latinos in an East South-Central state. Methods: A mixed-methods study with paraprofessionals was completed. A web-based, 42-item survey assessed demographics, cultural competency and diversity training in 76/. In-depth interviews about cultural knowledge and practices were completed with paraprofessionals providing nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos (n=8). Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Results: The majority of the respondents were non-Hispanic Whites (88.1\%) and had completed diversity training (86.8\%). The first theme reported for consideration in nutrition education for Hispanics/Latinos is the inclusion of both parents and children in nutrition education; an important aspect was engaging the whole family in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Next, they reported engagement with community partners as key in building trust and relationships with this community. These paraprofessionals worked with schools, churches and migrant camps to deliver nutrition education to Hispanics/Latinos. Finally, nutrition education paraprofessionals perceived nutrition education as an empowerment tool for Hispanic/Latino families to improve their health and socially engaged. Conclusion: Paraprofessionals provide an advantage in delivering culturally-sensitive nutrition education to ethnically diverse communities such as Hispanics/Latinos. Their knowledge of the family dynamics and community resources demonstrates their ability to engage this community in a culturally sensitive manner.},

Alaska Native people bear a disproportionate cancer burden, and Alaska's rural tribal health workers consequently requested cancer education accessible online. In response, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium cancer education team sought to create a framework for culturally relevant online learning to inform the creation of distance-delivered cancer education. Guided by the principles of community-based participatory action research and grounded in empowerment theory, the project team conducted a focus group with 10 Alaska Native education experts, 12 culturally diverse key informant interviews, a key stakeholder survey of 62 Alaska Native tribal health workers and their instructors/supervisors, and a literature review on distance-delivered education with Alaska Native or American Indian people. Qualitative findings were analyzed in Atlas.ti, with common themes presented in this article as a framework for culturally relevant online education. This proposed framework includes four principles: collaborative development, interactive content delivery, contextualizing learning, and creating connection. As an Alaskan tribal health worker shared "we're all in this together. All about conversations, relationships. Always learn from you/with you, together what we know and understand from the center of our experience, our ways of knowing, being, caring." The proposed framework has been applied to support cancer education and promote cancer control with Alaska Native people and has motivated health behavior change to reduce cancer risk. This framework may be adaptable to other populations to guide effective and culturally relevant online interventions.},

	abstract = {Aim: To develop a simple health literacy intervention aimed at supporting informed reproductive choice among members of UK communities practising customary consanguineous marriage. Background: The contribution of 'health literacy' to reducing health inequalities and improving primary health-care efficiency is increasingly recognised. Enhancing genetic literacy has received particular attention recently. Consanguineous marriage is customarily practised among some UK minority ethnic communities and carries some increased risk of recessive genetic disorders among offspring compared with unions among unrelated partners. The need to enhance genetic literacy on this issue has been highlighted, but no national response has ensued. Instead, a range of undocumented local responses are emerging. Important knowledge gaps remain regarding how the development and implementation of culturally appropriate, effective and sustainable responses can be achieved. Methods: Our co-design approach involved active participation by local people. Initial insight generation employed six focus group discussions and 14 individual interviews to describe current understandings and information needs. A total of 11 personas (heuristic narrative portraits of community 'segments') resulted; four participatory workshops provided further understanding of: preferred information channels; feasible information conveyance; and responses to existing materials. Prototype information resources were then developed and feedback gathered via two workshops. Following further refinement, final feedback from health-care professionals and community members ensured accuracy and appropriateness. Findings: The project demonstrated the utility of co-design for addressing an issue often considered complex and sensitive. With careful planning and orchestration, active participation by diverse community members was achieved. Key learning included: the importance of establishing trusting and respectful relationships; responding to diversity within the community; and engendering a creative and enjoyable experience. The resultant materials were heavily shaped by local involvement. Evaluative work is now needed to assess impacts on knowledge and service uptake. Longer term sustainability will depend on whether innovative community-level work is accompanied by broader strategy including investment in services and professional development.},

However, little is known about community as a concept among people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged settings and stakeholders' interactions and engagement in NCDs prevention and management. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand; (1) the meaning of community among people living in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs in Region Stockholm and (2) how communities interact and engage with stakeholders at local and regional levels for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in three municipalities in Region Stockholm with a high proportion of migrants. Multiple data collection methods were used, including observations of community activities; interviews with community members, representatives of public authorities and NGOs; and group interviews with healthcare providers. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: Community was perceived as living in close proximity with shared beliefs, values and resources. Although they recognized its social and cultural diversity, community members focused more on the commonalities of living in their neighborhood and less on their differences in country of birth and languages spoken. Several mismatches between awareness of community needs and the available skills and resources among stakeholders for T2D prevention were identified. Stakeholders expressed awareness of T2D risk and interest in addressing it in a culturally appropriate manner. Conclusion: Interaction between the communities and stakeholders was limited, as was engagement in T2D prevention and management. This highlights barriers in the collaboration between community, healthcare institutions and other stakeholders which consequently affect the implementation of preventive interventions. Innovative ways to link the community to the healthcare sector and other local government institutions are needed to build the capacity of health systems for T2D prevention in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.},

We describe perspectives of eight FN communities explaining cultural facilitators of mental wellbeing. The objective is to promote understanding of wellbeing in the context of sociocultural realities of FN communities and elaborate community-based practices. Qualitative methods involved FN partners in study design, implementation and data interpretation processes. Local research assistants collected data in all participating communities. Respondents were purposefully selected, Elders were recommended based on their knowledge of FN cultures and traditional wellness practices and awareness of health and social issues in respective communities. Results challenge specific histories of dispossession and assaults on community, language, identity, Elders, family; traditional healing practices emerged as important in enhancing mental wellbeing among FN. Culturally informed approaches aim to restore balance and harmony as pre-requisite to health. A framework based on the voices of FN in Manitoba is proposed for achieving mental wellbeing by and for FN people as an integral part of primary healthcare.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to understand how positive youth development through sport and physical activity is understood and experienced by urban indigenous youth. Research in positive youth development claims that structured physical activities are critical for development. The 5Â Cs (i.e.,Â confidence, competence, character, connection, caring) are a gold standard when discussing positive outcomes and are important characteristics for youth to possess to attain the sixth C-contribution. Indigenous leaders recognize the value of sport for indigenous children and youth. Recent works in sport psychology have called for research to understand youth sport and physical activity from diverse cultural perspectives. The current study used a community-based participatory framework, and 43 youth from across 3 Canadian settings were recruited. Talking circles were used to collect the data. Results point to some unique understandings of the 5Â Cs by the participants-namely, the inclusion of the self within each C.},

	abstract = {Background: Resources for Enhancing All Caregivers Health in the Department of Veterans Affairs (REACH VA) is an evidence-based intervention supporting family dementia caregivers that has been shown to improve caregiver outcomes for culturally diverse populations in the United States. However, this model has not been tested in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) including Vietnam, where community-based psychosocial interventions are urgently needed. The objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a culturally adapted version of the Resources for Enhancing All Caregivers Health in Vietnam (REACH VN).Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted over a 6-month period in Soc Son district located in Hanoi. An expected sample of 10 to 12 communes, representing approximately 50 dementia primary caregivers, will be randomized to either the REACH VN intervention or an enhanced control condition. Inclusion criteria for the caregiver include age â¥18, family member who provides the most day-to-day care for person with dementia, and a total score for the brief (4 item) Zarit Burden Scale of â¥6. Over the course of 2 to 3 months, each participant in the intervention group will receive the REACH VN intervention comprised of 4 core sessions on problem solving, mood management/cognitive restructuring, stress management, and communication, and up to 2 additional sessions based on caregiver's needs. The enhanced control group will receive a single session that provides verbal and written information on dementia. Caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline (i.e., time of enrolment) and 3 months. The feasibility will be assessed with regard to recruitment, retention, treatment adherence, treatment fidelity, and assessment processes. For preliminary effectiveness, we will examine caregiver burden as the primary outcome and changes in caregiver depressive symptoms and in Alzheimer disease knowledge as secondary outcomes.Discussion: This is the first study to test community-based family dementia caregiver intervention in Vietnam. Results from this study will provide the foundation for a larger effectiveness trial and broader dissemination in Vietnam and may help inform efforts to develop similar community-based family dementia caregiver support programs in other LMICs.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT03587974.

We used a mixed-methods approach based on data from both an online survey and telephone interviews. A majority of the participants had significant collaborations with health care providers and nonâhealth care providers. Strong partners included mental health providers, specialists, and primary care providers on the health side, and for nonâhealth partners, the strongest collaborations were with community leaders, research institutions, and local businesses. Themes that emerged for successful collaborations included having to be embedded in both the community and in institutions of power, ensuring that a shared vision and language with all partners are established, and leading with strength and tenacity. A focus on building a culture of health will grow as payment policy moves away from fee-for-service toward models that focus on incentivizing population health. Effective efforts to promote a culture of health require cross-sector collaborations that draw on long-term, trusting relationships among leaders. Health care practitioners can be important leaders and âbridgersâ in collaborations, but they must possess or develop the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of âbilingualâ facilitators, partners, and ârelationship builders.â},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Well-child visits are a critical component of pediatric health care; however, disparities in attendance and quality of care exist for Asian children. Limited research has explored Asian immigrant parents' perspectives about their well-child visit experience. METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted with Chinese, Vietnamese, and Asian Indian immigrant parents. Participants were recruited from community-based organizations in the Boston area. Interviews focused on parents' perceptions about well- child visits, including individual attitudes, social and cultural factors affecting their opinions, perceived behavioral control, and improving visits for Asian immigrant families. Data were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-one parents participated. Although participants reported attending well-child visits, they thought language barriers and unfamiliarity with US preventive health care may limit attendance for other Asian immigrant families. Some reported high-quality visits, while others described them as "too simple," recollecting health care experiences from their countries of origin where more tests were completed. Participants described seeking advice about their children's preventive care from elder family members. Many expressed the importance of culturally concordant health care providers and culturally sensitive care, while others thought that culture was less relevant. Differences emerged among the 3 subgroups around culturally concordant care and traditional medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Querying parents about their past health care experiences and providing information about well-child visits may be useful when caring for immigrant families. Social influences on children's health outside of the parent-provider-child triad may also be important. Further work should explore how to deliver culturally sensitive care that considers not only a family's language preferences but also their unique cultural identity.},

In the TÄmaki Community Action Research project, community volunteers were recruited and trained to conduct random household surveys (RHS) and asset mapping commissioned by community groups and government agencies in that area. The volunteers were involved in planning, coordination and ongoing governance of the project and {\textasciitilde}70 residents and local university students participated at different stages of the 2-year project. Over 600 RHS were completed and the volunteers' experiences were recorded in field notes, informal group discussions, daily team meetings and individual interviews and form the basis of this article. Only their experiences are discussed here, not the survey results which will be presented elsewhere. The project reflected the inherent asset-rich nature of the community via examples of individual volunteer empowerment and collective social/community capacity building. Volunteers increased their interpersonal and organizational skills, their understanding of the complexity of their community's logistics and cultural diversity, and gained an increased sense of community purpose and commitment. There was very strong endorsement of culturally sensitive research practice to recognize cultural differences and to engage productively within their richly ethnically diverse community. Full community volunteer participation in the project's governance (i.e. through design, training, implementation and ongoing consultation/management phases) was considered key to sustaining the life of project.},

	abstract = {New Zealandâs political, civic, health and social institutions have been criticised as being ill-prepared to serve the health and social needs of the countryâs increasingly diverse ageing population. This grounded theory study examined how late-life Asian immigrants participate in community to influence their subjective health. Bilingual Chinese, Indian, and Korean local intermediaries and research assistants were engaged as collaborative research partners. Purposive recruitment, and later theoretical sampling, were used to identify the 24 Chinese, 27 Indian, and 25 Korean participants, aged 60-83, who were 1-19 years post-immigration. Data were gathered through nine focus groups, and 15 individual interviews in the participantsâ language of choice. All data were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated to English for analysis. Data analysis was done using open coding, constant comparative analysis and dimensional analysis. Strengthening community was the core social process in the substantive theory developed. The participants actively advanced cultural connectedness and gave service with, and for, each other. Over time, they extended their focus toward doing so for the wider community. They purposely used long-standing, occupation-related skills to resource how they and their co-ethnic groups contributed to community health. Additionally, they sought novel opportunities to diversify their contributions. These late-life immigrants intentionally strove to stay healthy through doing. Achieving collective, as well as personal, health through community participation was for the sake of minimising potential burdens on the countryâs health system. The results indicate good health promotion policies would aim to advance co-ethnic, socially embedded networks for late-life Asian immigrants.},

The study had a participatory focus and aimed to generate a common framework leading to a joint assessment of the problem. Data were collected in a high school in which 19\% of students were Gitanos ; a combination of integrated qualitative and quantitative techniques were used. All sectors of the school community participated actively in the processes of collecting, structuring and interpreting data. The resulting concept map showed a multifactorial matrix where six main issues intersected: ethnic differences and intercultural relations; the influences and encouragement of families; adolescent risk behaviours; studentsâ individual values, expectations and practices; the accumulation of learning gaps that make school progress harder for some students; and the effects of remedial programmes, particularly those of compensatory education, that seem to be reinforcing segregation without bridging gaps. The articulated knowledge that participants provided was comprehensive, detailed and insightful. There was much intercultural agreement on some explanations but considerable dissent on others. Non- Gitanos blame Gitano families for not doing enough for their childrenâs education and for maintaining gender and marriage institutions that clash with the values and aims of the school. Gitano families and students reject these reasons and point to racist attitudes and exclusionary processes as key reasons for dropping out of school.},

	abstract = {Background: Social marginalization and criminalization create health and safety risks for sex workers and reduce their access to health promotion and prevention services compared to the general population. Community empowerment-based interventions that prioritize the engagement of sex workers show promising results. Peer-to-peer interventions, wherein sex workers act as educators of their colleagues, managers, clients and romantic partners, foster community mobilization and critical consciousness among sex workers and equip them to exercise agency in their work and personal lives. Methods: A pilot peer health education program was developed and implemented, with and for sex workers in one urban centre in Canada. To explore how the training program contributed to community empowerment and transformative learning among participants, the authors conducted qualitative interviews, asked participants to keep personal journals and to fill out feedback forms after each session. Thematic analysis was conducted on these three data sources, with emerging themes identified, organized and presented in the findings. Results: Five themes emerged from the analysis. Our findings show that the pilot program led to reduced internalized stigma and increased self-esteem in participants. Participants' critical consciousness increased concerning issues of diversity in cultural background, sexual orientation, work experiences and gender identity. Participants gained knowledge about how sex work stigma is enacted and perpetuated. They also became increasingly comfortable challenging negative judgments from others, including frontline service providers. Participants were encouraged to actively shape the training program, which fostered positive relationships and solidarity among them, as well as with colleagues in their social network and with the local sex worker organization housing the program. Resources were also mobilized within the sex worker community through skills building and knowledge acquisition. Conclusion: The peer education program proved successful in enhancing sex workers' community empowerment in one urban setting by increasing their knowledge about health issues, sharing information about and building confidence in accessing services, and expanding capacity to disseminate this knowledge to others. This 'proof of concept' built the foundation for a long-term initiative in this setting and has promise for other jurisdictions wishing to adapt similar programs.},

This paper aims to explore how the Baby Mat Service and Baby Mat practitioners position and locate themselves in a culturally diverse community setting where multiple meaning systems are drawn on for making sense of health concerns. Two key components of the Baby Mat Service are discussed: i) the presence of an inter-racial therapeutic couple on the mat; and ii) the stance adopted by the Baby Mat practitioners in relation to culturally diverse understandings of a presenting problem. The therapeutic couple engages with culturally-informed frames of reference in an attitude of wondering and tentative thinking (âmhlawumbeâin isiZulu). When a respectfully curious stance was taken by practitioners, it was found to help those accessing the mat to find symbolic meaning in the presenting problem and integrate this with cultural understandings.},

While pursuing marketing approaches to WaSH to improve health outcomes is often narrowly associated with monetary exchange, marketing theory recognises four broad marketing exchange archetypes: market-based, non-market-based, command-based and culturally determined. This diversity reflects the need for parameters broader than monetary exchange when improving WaSH. This study applied a participatory action research process to investigate how impoverished communities in Melanesian urban and peri-urban informal settlements attempt to meet their WaSH needs through marketing exchange. Exchanges of all four archetypes were present, often in combination. Motivations for participating in the marketing exchanges were based on social relationships alongside WaSH needs, health aspirations and financial circumstances. By leveraging these motivations and pre-existing, self-determined marketing exchanges, WaSH practitioners may be able to foster WaSH marketing exchanges consistent with local context and capabilities, in turn improving community physical, mental and social health.},

Co- researchers administered 518 surveys and conducted focus groups with 34 Latino immigrants. Participants relied on community clinics for care more often than is seen in nationwide Hispanic samples. Results revealed significant health care barriers, which Latino immigrants attribute to language, lack of quality interpreters, documentation status, and discrimination.

Low participation rates in cancer screening have been identified among migrant communities internationally. Attempting to improve low rates of cancer screening, the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland developed a pilot Cancer Screening Education Program for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. This study determines the impact of education sessions on knowledge, attitudes and intentions to participate in screening for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities living in Brisbane, Queensland.Methods: Seven CALD groups (Arabic-speaking, Bosnian, South Asian (including Indian and Bhutanese), Samoan and Pacific Island, Spanish-speaking, Sudanese and Vietnamese) participated in a culturally-tailored cancer screening education pilot program that was developed using the Health Belief Model. A pre- and post-education evaluation session measured changes in knowledge, attitudes and intention related to breast, bowel and cervical cancer and screening. The evaluation focussed on perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness and the target population's beliefs about reducing risk by cancer screening.Results: There were 159 participants in the three cancer screening education sessions. Overall participants' knowledge increased, some attitudes toward participation in cancer screening became more positive and intent to participate in future screening increased (n=146).Conclusion: These results indicate the importance of developing screening approaches that address the barriers to participation among CALD communities and that a culturally-tailored education program is effective in improving knowledge, attitudes about and intentions to participate in cancer screening.So what?: It is important that culturally-tailored programs are developed in conjunction with communities to improve health outcomes.},

	abstract = {The "Know Hepatitis B" campaign was the first national, multilingual communications campaign to promote testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV) among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). This population comprises fewer than 5\% of the total U.S. population but accounts for more than half of the up to 1.4 million Americans living with chronic HBV infection. To address this health disparity with a national campaign, CDC partnered with Hep B United, a national coalition of community-based partners working to educate AAPIs about hepatitis B and the need for testing. Guided by formative research, the "Know Hepatitis B" campaign was implemented in 2013 with a twopronged communications strategy. CDC used available Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese media outlets on a national level and relied on Hep B United to incorporate campaign materials into educational efforts at the local level. This partnership helped facilitate HBV testing among the priority population.},

	abstract = {Indigenous peoples around the world endure health and social disparities. In the United States, such disparities are typically ameliorated through conventional care services and organizations. Purpose: To examine points of tension that characterize culturally pluralistic care services in the United States, specifically Alaska, within context of Indigenous colonial histories. Design and Methods: The research design is ethnographic and multisited, comprising 12Â months of fieldwork across urban, rural and remote village sites in Alaska. A conceptual lens that accounts for culturally diverse social spaces where relations of power are at stake frames research presented here. This work incorporates relational and participatory action research principles with Alaska Native Elders. Ethnographic evidence was collected through multiple methods, including field notes, documents, and interviews, with ethnographic analysis involving atlas.ti. Findings: Alaska Native Elders describe salient points of tension characterizing Alaskaâs conventional care services through the following insights:generational curses-âa pain,prejudice on both sidesâwounded, andvalue-systems clashâfighting. Conclusion: This article concludes with discussion about collective anxieties and implications for care services.},

	abstract = {Although routine screening reduces cervical cancer rates between 60\% and 90\%, thousands of women worldwide are diagnosed with the disease on an annual basis because of inadequate screening. Haitian women in South Florida experience a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, with disease rates 4 times higher than the average for women in Miami. An ongoing community-based participatory research initiative to assess and reduce this burden has revealed that a complex interplay of factors contributes to a lack of access to screening in this community, including socioeconomics, language barriers, and traditional understandings of health and disease. In an effort to address some of these barriers and encourage uptake of primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention strategies, 2 videos on cervical cancer prevention were created using a community-based participatory research framework. The video screenplays were created by a Haitian screenwriter using evidence-based medical information provided by academic researchers. The films feature Haitian actors speaking a Haitian KreyÃ²l dialogue with a storyline portraying friends and family discussing human papillomavirus disease and vaccination, Papanicolaou testing, and cervical cancer. Focus groups held with Haitian women in South Florida suggested that the films are engaging; feature relatable characters; and impact knowledge about human papillomavirus, cervical cancer development, and current prevention recommendations.},

Immigrant populations may face structural and individual barriers in the access to and navigation of healthcare services in a new country. The aims of the study were to (1) generate new understanding of the processes that perpetuate immigrant disadvantages in maternity healthcare, and (2) devise potential interventions that might improve maternity experiences and outcomes for immigrant women in Canada.Methods: The study utilized a qualitative research approach that focused on ethnographic research design and data analysis contextualized within theories of organizational behaviour and critical realism. Data were collected over 2.5Â years using focus groups and in-depth semistructured interviews with immigrant women (nâ=â34), healthcare providers (nâ=â29), and social service providers (nâ=â23) in a Canadian province. Purposive samples of each subgroup were generated, and recruitment and data collection - including interpretation and verification of translations - were facilitated through the hiring of community researchers and collaborations with key informants.Results: The findings indicate that (a) communication difficulties, (b) lack of information, (c) lack of social support (isolation), (d) cultural beliefs, e) inadequate healthcare services, and (f) cost of medicine/services represent potential barriers to the access to and navigation of maternity services by immigrant women in Canada. Having successfully accessed and navigated services, immigrant women often face additional challenges that influence their level of satisfaction and quality of care, such as lack of understanding of the informed consent process, lack of regard by professionals for confidential patient information, short consultation times, short hospital stays, perceived discrimination/stereotyping, and culture shock.Conclusions: Although health service organizations and policies strive for universality and equality in service provision, personal and organizational barriers can limit care access, adequacy, and acceptability for immigrant women. A holistic healthcare approach must include health informational packages available in different languages/media. Health care professionals who care for diverse populations must be provided with training in cultural competence, and monitoring and evaluation programs to ameliorate personal and systemic discrimination.},

Despite universal screening recommendations, screening rates in the United States remain suboptimal, especially among the poor, the uninsured, recent immigrants, and Hispanics. This article describes the development of a large community-based colorectal cancer screening program designed to address these disparities. Method. The Against Colorectal Cancer in our Neighborhoods program is a bilingual, evidence-based, theory-guided, multicomponent community screening intervention, targeting the uninsured and developed using a systematic planning process. It combines community health workerâled outreach, bilingual and culturally tailored community education, and no-cost screening with provision of the fecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy and navigation services. A detailed process and outcome evaluation is planned. Program development cost calculated prospectively (in 2011 dollars) using a societal perspective and micro-costing methods was \$243,278, of which \$180,344 was direct cost. Discussion. The detailed description of the development processes and costs of this health promotion program targeting low-income Hispanics will inform health program decision makers about the resource requirements for planning and developing new programs to reduce disease burden in communities.},

We aimed to determine associations of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) with incident HF and left ventricular mass.Methods and Results: Among 6459 participants in the community-based Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, all of whom were free of prevalent clinical cardiovascular disease, we measured serum concentrations of PTH and 25(OH)D at the baseline examination. In longitudinal analyses, we tested associations of PTH and 25(OH)D with incident HF events, adjudicated by a panel of physicians. In cross-sectional analyses of a subset of 4763 participants, we tested associations of PTH and 25(OH)D with left ventricular mass, measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard and linear regression models were adjusted for demographics, physical examination measures, comorbidity, kidney function, and other mineral metabolism markers. Mean age was 62 years and 53\% of participants were female. There were 180 incident HF events over a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 8.46 (7.67 to 8.63) years. Compared with participants with PTH {\textless}65 pg/mL, PTH â¥65 pg/mL was associated with a 50\% greater risk of incident HF (95\% CI: 3\% to 210\%) and a 5.3 g higher left ventricular mass (95\% CI: 2.6, 7.9 g). In contrast, there was no association of 25(OH)D with risk of incident HF or elevated left ventricular mass.Conclusions: In a racially/ethnically diverse population without prevalent cardiovascular disease, higher serum PTH concentration was associated with increased left ventricular mass and increased risk of incident HF. Further studies should be pursued to determine whether PTH excess may be a modifiable risk factor for HF.},

	abstract = {Australia has a high number of people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds whose primary language is not English. CALD population groups have comparatively lower levels of education and health literacy, and poorer health outcomes compared with the Australian-born population. The delivery of consumer health information to people from CALD backgrounds usually includes the use of translated resources. Unfortunately, the quality of translated resources available on health issues is highly variable and may impact efforts to address the disparities in health outcomes. Currently applied guides to translation focus on accuracy and literalness of the translation; however, for health translations, conveying meaning and incorporating culturally relevant information is essential. Minimum standards for developing translated resources are needed to provide an indication of quality for end users, including healthcare providers, the client and carer. This paper describes the development of a Translation Standard, led by a community nursing organisation in collaboration and consultation with CALD community members and peak community organisations in Melbourne, Australia. The Translation Standard includes 10 components that have been identified as necessary to ensure a minimum standard of translation that is of high quality and caters to the health literacy levels of the target audience. What is known about the topic? There are many people from CALD backgrounds who have worse health outcomes than people who are Australian born. There is a gap in guidance to health professionals on how to develop high-quality translations of consumer health information that consider culture and health literacy. Higher-quality translations are needed to better inform CALD groups about their health. What does this paper add? The description of a new Translation Standard to guide the development of culturally relevant consumer health translations, considering the cultural needs and health literacy level of the target audience. What are the implications for practitioners? The Translation Standard provides assurance to practitioners that any translation that has followed this Standard is of high quality and increases the likelihood that the target audience will find the information relevant and understandable. The Translation Standard can assist consumers to make more informed choices and decisions about their health. Future translations would benefit by using such a guide.},

Focus groups with stakeholders in two communities, one rural and one metropolitan, were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed by categorizing data according to each capital component. In addition to the concepts contained in the capacity framework a new category, informational capital (data specific to the community) emerged during the analysis. We suggest that by acting as a catalyst a community based interprofessional program can affect components of community resilience/capacity, primarily human, social, and informational capital.

A mixed-method approach was employed to examine these experiences using talking circles and a survey. The study contributes to anticolonial research in that it resists narratives of dis(ease) put forth through neocolonial research paradigms. A key focus was the development of strategies that address the aspirations of urban Aboriginal youth, laying foundations upon which their potential in health and wellness can be nurtured, supported, and realized. The study contributes to a new narrative of the health of urban Aboriginal youth within a culturally centred and culturally safe framework that acknowledges their strong connection to their Indigenous lands, languages, and traditions while also recognizing the spaces between which they move.},

	abstract = {The Genesee County Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) program is a community-based program designed to reduce African American infant mortality rates in Flint, Michigan. Genesee County REACH activities address three core themes: fostering community mobilization, reducing racism, and enhancing the maternal-infant health care system. The REACH Community Action Plan was generated using a community-based participatory approach, and is based on a socio-ecological model with interventions focused at the individual, organizational, health system, and community levels. Genesee County REACH's Community Windshield Tours were developed to raise awareness of social and environmental barriers to health promotion among health care system staff in Flint, Michigan. These tours provide a close-up examination of the community's environmental conditions and the experiences of mothers, children, and families at risk for poor birth outcomes. In this article, we report our findings from pre-/post-tour surveys, as well as long-term follow-up surveys, to assess the impact of this REACH activity on participants' knowledge and beliefs about Genesee County residents, and to determine any resultant individual, policy, system, or environmental changes. We used t tests to compare participants' responses before and after the tours. We found that several individual- and systems-level changes have resulted from these tours, reflecting greater cultural sensitivity and increased understanding of patients' circumstances. African American infant mortality rates in Genesee County declined to a historic low in 2005, and they remain lower than in previous years. Although REACH coalition partners recognize that this reduction cannot be attributed to a single intervention or activity, REACH activities such as the Community Windshield Tours addressing multiple levels of the socio-ecological model may have had a synergistic effect.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increases in the availability, affordability, and promotion of high-calorie foods and beverages and decreased obligations for routine physical activity have fostered trends of increased obesity worldwide. In high-income, plural societies, above average obesity prevalence is often observed in ethnic minority communities, suggesting that obesity-promoting influences are more prevalent or potent in these communities. METHODS: An interdisciplinary group of scholars engaged in multiple rounds of focused discussion and literature review to develop a Community Energy Balance Framework (CEB). The objective was to explore the nature of the excess obesity risk in African descent and other ethnic minority populations and identify related implications for planning and evaluating interventions to prevent obesity. RESULTS: A key principle that emerged is that researchers and programmers working with ethnic minority communities should contextualize the food- and physical activity-related sociocultural perspectives of these communities, taking into account relevant historical, political, and structural contexts. This perspective underscores the fallacy of approaches that place the entire burden of change on the individual, particularly in circumstances of social disadvantage and rapid cultural shifts. CONCLUSION: The CEB framework is proposed for use and further development to aid in understanding potential health-adverse effects of cultural-contextual stresses and accommodations to these stresses.},

	abstract = {Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. Mental illness prevalence is higher amongst communities that face multiple prejudices and disadvantages within society, including Black and minority ethnic communities who may experience migration trauma, racism, acculturation and adverse social circumstances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness. Participants suggested a new model for national campaigns placing greater emphasis upon community development, cultural events, positive contact and dialogue with families, faith leaders and youth groups. National anti-stigma programmes must develop more effective partnerships with communities or risk magnifying existing inequalities. Despite a range of national programmes to address stigma towards people with mental illness, it remains as the major barrier to social inclusion for people with mental illness living in communities. Stigma is particularly severe if people have a mental illness and are also economically disadvantaged or face multiple stigmas. By adopting community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches with three Black and ethnic minority communities in Scotland, this study makes the case that stigma can only be understood and effectively addressed with reference to its socio-cultural context.},

Concept mapping was used to enable members of racial/ethnic minority communities who were engaged in prevention research to identify issues to consider when adapting physical activity recommendations for use with and within racial and ethnic minority communities. Concept mapping resulted in ten issues to consider when adapting physical activity interventions. Areas of similarity and difference in how these issues were ranked among racial/ethnic groups were reviewed. The issues to consider when adapting evidence-based physical activity interventions with and within racial/ethnic minority communities were similar to those discussed in previous literature; however, the operationalization of many of these issues was seen as unique.},

This chapter focuses on the recruitment process undertaken to secure participants for two breast cancer prevention education studies. Spanish-speaking Latinas were recruited for both studies. Data collection took place at community-organized events tailored to Latino communities. Emphasis is placed on recruitment strategies used that follow community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles. We report several strategies utilized to contact and motivate Latinas to participate in research seeking to better understand factors that influence their breast cancer screening behaviors. We present recruitment strategies that were tailored to the target population, helped develop participants' trust and engaged the community and that were successful in encouraging and increasing research participation. Factors that challenge the recruitment of ethnic minorities in community settings call for flexible and culturally sensitive and culturally appropriate recruitment strategies. By utilizing strategies that follow CBPR principles, we took necessary steps to successfully recruit. Latinas into cancer prevention education research studies conducted in community settings.

Strategies included structured group exercise breaks and serving healthy refreshments at organizational functions. During the first 2 years, we subcontracted with 6 community-based organizations (primary partners) who disseminated these wellness strategies to 29 organizations within their own professional networks (secondary worksites) through peer modeling and social support. We analyzed data from the first 2 years of the project to evaluate our dissemination approach.Outcome: Primary partners had difficulty recruiting organizations in their professional network as secondary partners to adopt wellness strategies. Within their own organizations, primary partners reported significant increases in implementation in 2 of the 6 core organizational strategies for promoting physical activity and healthy eating. Twelve secondary worksites that completed organizational assessments on 2 occasions reported significant increases in implementation in 4 of the 6 core organizational strategies.Interpretation: Dissemination of organizational wellness strategies by trained community organizations through their existing networks (train-the-trainer) was only marginally successful.

Ethnic subgroup distribution included 22 African American, 20 English-speaking Caribbean-born, and 20 Haitian-born respondents.Methods: Community-based participatory research methods were used to conduct face-to-face individual interviews in the community.Main Research Variables: Ethnic subgroup, health access, perceptions of CRC (e.g., awareness of screening tests, perceived risk, perceived barriers to screening), healthcare provider recommendation, and self-reported CRC screening.Findings: Awareness of CRC screening tests, risk perception, healthcare provider recommendation, and self-reported use of screening were low across all subgroups. However, only 55\% of Haitian-born participants had heard about the fecal occult blood test compared to 84\% for English-speaking Caribbean-born participants and 91\% for African Americans. Similarly, only 15\% of Haitian-born respondents had had a colonoscopy compared to 50\% for the English-speaking Caribbean and African American subgroups.Conclusions: This exploratory, developmental pilot study identified lack of awareness, low risk perception, and distinct barriers to screening. The findings support the need for a larger community-based study to elucidate and address disparities among subgroups.Implications for Nursing: Nurses play a major role in reducing cancer health disparities through research, education, and quality care.

Twenty-seven Latino AYA survivors ({\textgreater}/=15 years of age) completed key informant interviews and 21 Latino parents participated in focus groups.Results: Both AYA survivors and parents identified two major facilitative factors for survivorship care: Involvement of the nuclear family in the AYA's survivorship care in the adult healthcare setting and including symptom communication in late effects discussions. Barriers to care included: perceived stigma of a cancer history and continued emotional trauma related to discussions about the childhood cancer experience.Conclusions: Barriers to survivorship care include cancer stigma for both patient and nuclear family, which can impact on seeking survivorship care due to constraints placed on discussions because it remains difficult to discuss 'cancer' years later. Future research can evaluate if these findings are unique to Latino childhood cancer survivors or are found in other populations of AYA cancer survivors transitioning to adult-centered healthcare. This community-based participatory research collaboration also highlights the opportunity to learn about the needs of childhood cancer survivors from the lens of community leaders serving culturally diverse populations.

American Indians and Alaska Natives face many unique health disparities and challenges and they confront many barriers when seeking care and treatment. These obstacles make it essential for healthcare professionals to engage the community in the development of culturally appropriate strategies with which to address health issues. This article describes a community-based participatory approach that was executed successfully by the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. By utilizing the Community Readiness Model, it effectively built on the culture and resiliency that exists in each of 10 communities to more successfully implement community-responsive health prevention and treatment.

Community-based programs have yet to demonstrate significant influence. Data on large-scale community-level interventions targeting minority communities are limited. The aim of this study is to measure the impact of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH 2010) project, a community-based intervention to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in blood cholesterol screening in minority communities. METHODS: Annual survey data from 2001 to 2006 were gathered in 22 communities. Trends in the prevalence of age-standardised blood cholesterol screening were examined for four racial/ethnic groups (black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian/Alaska Native), stratified by education level, and compared with national data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: The prevalence of cholesterol screening increased among persons in black, Hispanic and Asian REACH communities (p{\textless}0.001), whereas prevalence decreased in the total US and Hispanic populations (p{\textless}0.001) and remained similar among blacks and Asians nationwide. The relative disparity between the total US population and most REACH communities decreased (p{\textless}0.05). Relative disparity in cholesterol screening related to education level decreased (p{\textless}0.05) within REACH communities, whereas relative disparity related to education level nationwide remained similar in blacks and increased (p{\textless}0.001) in Hispanics.

	abstract = {The underlying psychosocial processes that produce immigrant mental wellbeing are understudied in anthropology and medicine. This paper provides insights into these processes by describing culturally diverse immigrants' perceptions of mental health and adaptation strategies. Qualitative data were collected from 21 focus groups as part of a large, multidisciplinary, participatory action research project about mental health with five ethnolinguistic groups (Mandarin-speaking Chinese, Polish, Punjabi Sikh, Somali and Spanish-speaking Latin American) in Ontario, Canada. In framing the analysis, transformative concepts are applied to address dimensions of power and culture - social liminality and cultural negotiation - to the ongoing psychosocial processes of coping with mental distress. 'Social liminality' describes how immigrants perceive themselves to be in a psychologically stressful, transitional state, whereas 'cultural negotiation' describes how they actively cope with cultural tensions and respond to mental health challenges. Study findings show that while social liminality and cultural negotiation are stressful, they also have the potential to help individuals adapt by producing a positive synthesis of ideas about mental health in new social and cultural contexts. The study contributes to the shift from problem identification using a biomedical model of mental illness to a more psychosocial and ecological approach that reveals the potential for resolving some mental health problems experienced in immigrant communities. Describing active psychosocial process of adaptation also reinforces the therapeutic and educational value of partnerships between practitioners and clients and immigrant communities and mental health systems.},

Yet, the growth of the Latino population in rural areas in the United States often results in isolation of these communities, fewer resources, and invisible barriers that lead to health disparities. Specifically, substance use is of growing concern in many rural Latino communities. To help eliminate health disparities, treatment must be provided by well-trained, qualified, and culturally competent health professionals. This article reviews the relevant literature that highlights health disparity issues, and discusses ways to reduce, and eventually eliminate, minority health inequities by building on and strengthening the community partners' ability to collaborate on intervention programs. The challenges of collaborating with trained bilingual clinicians along with issues of mental health promotion in rural Latino communities are identified.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine whether culturally diverse adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health care behaviors is associated with the following social and cognitive variables: health self-efficacy, value placed on health, perceived barriers to health promotion, and perceptions regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care behaviors.Procedure: A cross-sectional study involving 108 high school students in health education classes was conducted. The majority of these participants (59.3\%) identified as a racial minority, and 68\% of these participants were female.Results: Health self-efficacy, value placed on health, and perceptions regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care practices were all significantly correlated with the participating adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health care behaviors. Primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care behaviors emerged as significant predictors of the participating adolescents' preventative health care behaviors.Conclusions: Present findings suggest that family and peers are likely role models for adolescents in the area of preventative health care behaviors. Thus, interventions to promote these behaviors among adolescents similar to those in the present study need to be family, school, and community-based.},

Community involvement is crucial to interventions aimed at reducing health disparities, and local health departments increasingly are called upon to provide both leadership and funding. The Tacoma Pierce County Health Department (TPCHD), in conjunction with 13 key community-based organizations and healthcare systems, formed the Cross Cultural Collaborative of Pierce County (CCC) that successfully employs needs-assessment and evaluation techniques to identify community health initiatives. METHODS: Community leaders from six underserved populations of the CCC were trained in needs-assessments techniques. Assessments measured effectiveness of the collaborative process and community health initiatives by using key informant (n = 18) and group interviews (n = 3). RESULTS: The CCC, facilitated by its partnership with the TPCHD, built capacity and competence across community groups to successfully obtain two funded public health initiatives for six priority populations. Members expressed overall satisfaction with the training, organizational structure, and leadership. The CCC's diversity, cultural competency, and sharing of resources were viewed both as a strength and a decision-making challenge. CONCLUSION: Public health department leadership, collaboration, and evidence-based assessment and evaluation were key to demonstrating effectiveness of the interventions, ensuring the CCC's sustainability.},

	abstract = {Objective. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) was launched in 1998 to address the disproportionate rates of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an evaluation to assess the influence of MAI in four communities, and the extent to which these communities increased their capacity to meet the HIV prevention needs of racial and ethnic minorities. Design. Retrospective data were collected annually through individual interviews over three years. Individual interviews were conducted with community stakeholders across the three waves of data collection. Data were analyzed using standardized qualitative methods including codebook development, coding, inter-coder agreement assessments, and data interpretation. This paper will highlight one area of inquiry - community stakeholders' perceptions of the impact of MAI in their communities. Results. Community stakeholders reported that MAI increased capacity to respond to the HIV epidemic and provide services to racial and ethnic minorities. Specifically, MAI was perceived to have increased community empowerment, involvement, and awareness of HIV/AIDS; expanded HIV-related services and organizational self-sufficiency; and improved collaboration and the coordination of services in the community. Although recognizing MAI gave national focus to the impact of the epidemic on minority communities, respondents raised concerns about the implementation process and the lack of sustainability planning. Conclusion. MAI represented an initial national attempt to address the disproportionate rates of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. However, other strategies are also needed to address these significant health disparities. At CDC, steps are currently underway to develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. As community stakeholders are critical partners in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV, strengthening their capacity and promoting their involvement can help combat the epidemic.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Several Asian-American groups are at a higher risk of dying of liver diseases attributable to hepatitis-B infection. This culturally diverse community should be well informed of and protected against liver diseases. The present study assesses the knowledge of hepatitis B before and after a hepatitis-B educational program and determines the infection status of an Asian community. Methods: Nine Asian communities of Montgomery County, MD, enrolled in the hepatitis-B prevention program between 2005 and 2006. They attended culturally tailored lectures on prevention, completed self-administered pre- and posttests, and received blood screening for the disease. Results: More than 800 Asian Americans participated in the study. Knowledge of prevention was improved after educational delivery. The average infection rate was 4.5\%, with Cambodian, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean groups having higher infection rates. The age group of 36-45 had the highest percentage of carriers (9.1\%). Conclusion: Many Asian groups, particularly those of a southeast Asian decent, were subject to a higher probability of hepatitis-B infection. At an increased risk are first-generation Asian immigrants, groups with low immunization rates and those aged 36-45. The findings provide potential directions for focusing preventive interventions on at-risk Asian communities to reduce liver cancer disparities.},

METHODS: African American and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes from 3 health care systems in Detroit, Michigan, participated in diabetes lifestyle intervention of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Detroit Partnership. The intervention curricula were culturally and linguistically tailored for each population. Trained community residents delivered the curricula in 5 group meetings aimed at improving dietary, physical activity, and diabetes self-care behaviors of study participants. The aims of the process evaluation were to assess participant satisfaction with the intervention, utility, and applicability of information and cultural relevance of intervention materials. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Matrices were developed along thematic lines, and common themes were determined by grouping responses by question. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants attended 1 or more intervention classes; 41\% attended all 5 meetings. Attendance rates ranged from 59\% to 88\% for individual meetings. Participants reported that program information and activities were useful, culturally relevant, and applicable to diabetes self-management.

Formative research using focus groups and individual interviews elicited feedback from multiple community sectors: community members, task force and coalition members, administrators, service implementers, health care providers, and physical activity instructors. Using qualitative data analysis, 47 transcripts (N = 197) were analyzed. Most sectors identified needs for culturally diverse resources, promotion of existing resources, demonstration of future cost savings, and culturally tailored, proactive outreach. The program was viewed favorably, especially if integrated into existing resources. Linking sectors to connect resources and expertise was considered essential. Complexities of such large-scale collaborations were identified. These results may guide communities interested in diffusing health promotion interventions.},

A participatory action research design was used, involving people from BME communities who had experienced mental health problems and external stakeholders. The study relied largely on qualitative methodology. Findings reported here indicate that participants in the project valued the culturally and spiritually relevant support they received, but felt that more opportunities were needed for training and employment, greater representation on the project's management committee, and greater awareness of the project in the community. External stakeholders felt that the project gained credibility from its community base and valued its ability to work across faith traditions and cultures. It was also seen as successful in acting as a bridge between the communities and statutory services, although there were concerns about the project's relationship with frontline services. The paper proposes two models of community development that primary care trusts may wish to adopt - radical or consensus, or a mixture of both - in order to address inequalities in mental health service provision.},

To address this concern, several health entities in Nashville, Tennessee responded to a grant initiative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) demonstration project. The resulting award is the Nashville REACH 2010 Project, charged to develop sustainable methods to reduce and, in time, eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the North Nashville community, where mortality rates of these diseases are substantially higher than in other parts of the county. As one of its many interests, the project included potential health care providers to receive and disseminate messages about disease prevention and health education.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose. A curriculum-based service-learning (SL) project provided: (1) integration of SL principles; (2) a description of a viable SL model; and (3) a method to increase awareness of the profession of physical therapy for a diverse population of school-age students, promoting active participation and enhancing community linkages within a mentor/protege framework. Method/Model Description and Evaluation. SL is experiential education with community service, connecting theory and real-life practice with reflection opportunities. Through mentor/protege relationships, students were mentored by health care professionals, investigated theoretical constructs of mentoring and pluralism, and explored viable communities for diversity enhancement projects. Students proposed sites, then winnowed selections, identified resources, and developed curricular plans for SL. In concert with faculty and administrative staffs, mentoring plans were set in motion for two communities: (1) a hands-on museum attracting diverse K-6 students from six counties, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing and migrant farm workers' children of Hispanic descent and (2) an after-school program for African American children from low-income families. Evaluative data collected determined the effectiveness of mentoring interventions and experiences aligned with objectives. Illustrating the intended SL purposes, physical therapist (PT) students concluded with in-class presentations utilizing videotape vignettes, photographs, administrative evaluations, and self-assessments and team assessments. The implemented projects included age-appropriate interactive learning exhibits and skits, emphasizing PT roles and responsibilities. Outcomes. Artifacts and evaluations supported the nurturing potential of SL through these community-based mentor/protege encounters. Clearly achieving course objectives and community needs, PT students promoted the profession to a diverse student population and creative leadership roles were realized beyond the traditional classroom/clinic. Students were recognized with the National Student Assembly 'Student Outreach for Cultural Diversity Awareness' Award. Discussion and Conclusion. Through this SL model, additional professional implications were realized: (1) the unexpected outcomes of students as stewards and leaders; (2) an avenue to serve as mentors for at-risk school-age children, who otherwise might not have gained first-hand exposure and insight into the profession; (3) a positive and meaningful experience to allow students to provide community service while fulfilling university service outcomes; and (4) enhanced exposure to the profession beyond the classroom and clinical walls, nurturing the spirit of service. PT students assumed ownership of these projects bridging classroom theories and readings with real-life application, with faculty in the role of facilitators of the learning experience.},

	abstract = {AIM: This study set out to examine the socio-cultural, familial and environmental factors influencing health, eating habits and patterns of physical activity contributing to child and adolescent overweight and obesity. METHODS: Semi-structured, community-based interviews were conducted with contrasting key informant three-generation families; and generation by generation focus groups of grandparents, parents and children from four cultural communities in the state of Victoria, Australia. Purposive sampling occurred from Turkish, Greek, Indian and Chinese communities that have migrated to Australia within the last three generations (n = 160, eight families, 47 children aged 5-15 years, 29 parents, 42 grandparents). RESULTS: Evidence of two-way influences on eating and physical activity across three generations was evident, with children reporting the greatest cross-cultural diversity. A range of dietary restrictions was reported across all cultural groups. Efforts to foster healthy eating and lifestyle patterns within communities were evident. Parents, as a generation in particular, felt the need for more access to education and support regarding healthy limits for pre-puberty and puberty stages. CONCLUSION: There is a dynamic influence of culture on many aspects of family lifestyle across three generations. To achieve successful intervention design, childhood obesity researchers need to collaborate with diverse groups and communities. Considering the role and influence of extended family, a multigenerational, whole-of-community approach beyond that of parent and child populations ought to be considered.},

The participatory action research (PAR) paradigm is well suited to address these multilevel inequalities in research and evaluation experienced by many ethnic and racial communities. In this article, a case study of a project to reduce health disparities in breast and cervical cancer among seven Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Southern California is presented. The authors applied a PAR framework to the process of needs assessment and program planning to understand and address the complex and multilevel factors that contribute to the problem of disparate breast and cervical cancer screening rates in these communities. Finally, the authors describe the lessons that were learned about how to promote collaborative research as an essential element in the design of projects and studies to address ethnic disparities in health outcomes for breast and cervical cancer.},

This study used grounded theory methodology to examine how cultural factors regulate help seeking and social support in a sample of 25 Japanese sojourners' wives living in America. Culturally based social edicts such as mutual responsibility and in-group solidarity were found to promote help seeking and social support. In contrast, culturally specific factors such as enryo (polite deference) hierarchy, and the cultural rules governing reciprocity inhibited these behaviors. From these data, a cultural model of social exchange allowing for cultural diversity, is proposed. This model can increase the effectiveness of nursing interventions aimed at community-based health promotion.},

Women from diverse community groups in Marseille, France participated in a five-session group intervention seeking to educate women about their bodies, teach protection skills, develop solidarity, and prompt community diffusion of information and new norms. Intervention sessions were held weekly, and included visual and hands-on demonstration materials and free protection supplies. Knowledge scores on protection methods improved over the course of the study, and 56\% of respondents reported having tried the female condom at least once. The intervention was very highly rated, with the best-liked aspect (50\%) being the group process. Women of African or French territories' origin rated the female condom more positively than women born in continental France or Europe. Evidence suggests that the approach used is feasible and well-liked by women of diverse cultural backgrounds in south-eastern France. Longer follow-up is required to assess behavioural change.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: As part of a larger study exploring psychosocial factors that influence self-care and use of health care services during pregnancy, we investigated the process of pregnancy discovery and acceptance among a culturally diverse group of women who had given birth to their first child in the year preceding data collection. METHODS: Eighty-seven low-income women from four cultural groups (African American, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and white) participated in eight focus groups held in their communities. The focus groups were ethnically homogenous and stratified by early and late entry into prenatal care. A social influence model guided the development of focus group questions, and the study followed a participatory action research model, with community members involved in all phases of the research. RESULTS: Issues that emerged from the focus groups as possible influences on timing of pregnancy recognition include the role of pregnancy signs and symptoms and pregnancy risk perception in the discovery process, the role of social network members in labeling and affirming the pregnancy, concerns about disclosure, 'planning' status of the pregnancy, and perceived availability of choices for resolving an unintended pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnancy discovery process is complex, and when protracted, can potentially result in delayed initiation of both prenatal care and healthful pregnancy behaviors. Enhancing our understanding of pregnancy discovery and acceptance has clear implications for primary and secondary prevention. Future research is needed to further explain the trajectory of pregnancy discovery and acceptance and its influence on health behaviors and pregnancy outcome.},

Program activities evaluated included a series of 15 charlas, or group discussions, led by various health professionals, a telephone follow-up interview conducted after the charlas and a 21-segment radio program with distribution of educational materials. Data were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed by 200 people and from two telephone surveys of Latino men and women living in the Washington, DC area. Analyses included gender and age group comparisons of overall satisfaction with the charlas, diffusion of information from charlas and printed materials, participants' adoption of heart-healthy behaviors, and consumer satisfaction with the radio program and printed educational materials. Few gender and age differences were found and results showed that participants were satisfied with the charlas and the radio program. Between 54\% and 87\% of charla respondents reported sharing printed educational materials with others. The average number of bilingual booklets read by different gender and age groups was between four and five. The results demonstrate how programmatic activities of Salud para su Corazon were effectively disseminated in the Latino community of Washington, DC.},

The older adult is often stereotypically perceived as being only capable of certain types of leisure activities, such as bowls, bingo and cards. In multicultural Australia, activities need to be more diverse. Recreational folk dance provides an activity that is socially engaging, physically challenging, creative, and culturally and mentally stimulating. Involvement in the activity has general exercise benefits, which contribute to a healthy lifestyle. The participants can be empowered by their increased participation in community life, due to the classes, but also because of the public performance aspect that is offered with this activity. Exposure to folk costumes, customs, and traditions, can increase awareness of other cultures. Recreational folk dance has a beneficial effect on interpersonal and intrapersonal aspects of self. The language of dance crosses many cultures. Gesture and movement can be conveyed without words, thus making folk dance a good 'non-language' based activity to be used in a multicultural population.},

	doi = {10.31219/osf.io/hg6ea},
	abstract = {Aims and Objectives/Purpose/Research Questions: The connection between language contact and the bilingual speaker goes back to foundational authors in the field of contact linguistics. Yet there is very little work that combines these two levels in a single study. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to language contact by testing the role of cross-language priming on contact-induced change at the level of complex NPs.Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted three studies with different types of data. In Study 1, we analyse the Romani Morpho-Syntax database to identify word order preferences in Romani dialects from different countries. In Study 2, we examine a corpus of interviews in Romani from Romania. In Study 3, we conduct an experiment to test short-term priming in adjective/noun order from Romanian to Romani and within Romani.Data and Analysis: In Study 1, we examine the word order in approximately 3,000 NPs from 119 Romani speakers. In Study 2, we analyse a speech corpus of 9,400 words from four elderly Romani-Romanian bilinguals. In Study 3, 90 Romani-Romanian bilinguals participated in a priming experiment. We used multinomial mixed-effects logistic regression, Bayesian models and Random Forests to analyse the experimental results.Findings/Conclusions: Study 1 shows that Romani speakers from Romania stand out for their frequent use of postnominal adjectives. Study 2 confirms these uses in free speech. Study 3 reveals significant cross-language priming effects, whereby speakers favour the use of DET-N-ADJ order in Romani immediately following a NDET-ADJ sentence read in Romanian.Originality: Our study is the first to demonstrate cross-language priming effects on linguistic change in adjective/noun order.Significance/Implications: We illustrate a unified approach to language contact by introducing theoretical and methodological advances from the field of bilingualism into the study of contact-induced change.},

	abstract = {This study aims to investigate the perspectives of non-native English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers across mother tongue and gender, and their male and female adult students, regarding the use of Arabic in the EFL classrooms at the university level in Saudi Arabia. The study specifically seeks to investigate the perspectives of non-native Arab and non-Arab EFL teachers as they, working in the native Arab setting, often resort to Arabic (Al-Nofaie, 2010; Machaal, 2012). However, there are glaring research gaps about non-native EFL teachersâ and adult learnersâ beliefs on the use of first language (L1) in the classroom. For this purpose, the study used quantitative research design, and administered two questionnaires, one for the teachers and the other for the students. Studentsâ questionnaire complemented that of the teachers. Forty teachers and sixty students were selected based on stratified random sampling. The findings of the study revealed that all camps of teachers, Arab, non-Arab, male, female, and students were in favour of judicious bilingual approach. The study finds statistically significant difference between the beliefs of Arab and non-Arab EFL teachers about the use of L1. The findings suggest that Arab EFL teachersâ use of Arabic is extensive, while non-Arab EFL teachersâ use of Arabic is well-timed. The study suggested practical implications for the improvement of English Language Teaching (ELT) in Saudi Arabia by recommending planned, occasional and judicious use of L1 while teaching EFL adult learners.},

It aims to investigate whether bilingual speakers have an advantage over monolingual speakers in performing visual-spatial working memory tasks. The present study attempts to be a contribution to the discussion of how working memory performance is affected by bilingualism. It tries to find out whether Arabic-English bilingual speakers have advantages over Arabic monolingual speakers in performing visual-spatial working memory tasks. Two experiments were conducted to test the working memory performance of bilinguals and monolinguals by using verbal and non-verbal tasks. The two measures were completed online; the non-verbal measure involved a picture memorization task, whereas the verbal measure involved word retrieval. Eighty female college students voluntarily participated in the study. Half were Arabic-English bilinguals, and the other half were Arabic monolinguals. Both groups were divided into two subgroups; half performed a non-verbal working memory task, and the other half participated in a verbal working memory task. The results showed no advantages for bilinguals in the picture memorization task. However, a bilingual advantage was found in the verbal working memory task in which bilingual speakers performed better in word retrieval compared to monolingual speakers. The findings indicate a positive effect of bilingualism on working memory performance, particularly in the visual-spatial component.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between code-switching and language proficiency. The study also attempted to explain how Saudi bilingual female students view code-switching in relation to language proficiency and deficiency. A questionnaire and an elicited production task were used to collect data. A sample size of 24 Saudi female students from the English department at King Saud University participated in the questionnaire. In addition, six Saudi female students from the same department were taken for the purpose of carrying out the task. The collected data was analyzed by using percentages, a content analysis technique, and a simple frequency count. Findings and results indicated that there is a correlation between the type of code-switching and language proficiency. The results also revealed that the frequency of code-switching was not related to the level of language proficiency of participants. Positive attitudes towards using code-switching were found among the participants. Based on the results, it could be concluded that code-switching is not a sign of language incompetency. Instead, code-switching is a tool that the majority of participants preferred while speaking with bilinguals.},

The study aims to explore the potential benefits of utilizing bilingual public signage representing translational content to develop translation studentsâ critical literacy, language awareness, and translation skills through reflecting on the use of LL as a teaching and learning material. The study is significant as it addresses the gap in the literature on the use of LL to promote studentsâ critical literacy, language awareness, and translation skills in the EFL context of Oman. The samples of the study are 58 participants enrolled in undergraduate translation courses at Dhofar University. The data collection methods used in the study consist of focus group discussions, online surveys, and teacherâs retrospective reflection. The quantitative data were analyzed by IBM SPSS V26, while the qualitative data were analyzed by common themes that emerged from studentsâ feedback and teacherâs reflection. The findings of the study showed positive outcomes on the use of LL as a teaching and learning resource such as improved language awareness, language proficiency, translation skills, creativity, and critical thinking skills. The implication of the study is to draw attention to the existing quality of the learnersâ LL and invite them to actively and responsibly participate in improving the linguistic landscapes of their local communities.},

Hence, translation agencies thrive based on the fundamental principles and practices of the market. Competence defines the game, and training improves the performance of each player. It is the main objective of this study to identify the training needs of professional Saudi translators. Improving translation competency can be catered through effective training where needs analysis comes as its preliminary and integral requirement. This study has involved 166 professional translators and 20 owner-managers from the biggest translation agencies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Leaning on quantitative and qualitative data gathered from them, the essential factors for translator training were derived, to wit: translation fundamentals, extra-linguistic abilities, and bilingualism.

At the end, the expected results from this quality improvement exercise are: an increase in enrollment, higher schooling (average of number grades reached), and reduction in dropout and repetition rates. The outcome of such bilingual programs, based on some international experiences points to an improvement in learning and performance levels in children. The issue is controversial, because while Peru was short of funds for education in the past, and serving a dispersed population like in the Amazon is more expensive than working with the urban population, the argument of costs is not entirely correct. As previous research has proved that bilingual education for children who do not speak the official language, if properly implemented, has greater potential to improve their learning experience both in terms of speed and quality. The paper tests the positive returns of the proposed IBE program using two techniques: cost effectiveness and private benefits and provides ideas to engage the results in the current policy discussions in the Ministry, the rest of the public sector and the academia.},

It elucidates the linguistic dilemma of the present times and identifies space for bilingualism and pluriculturalism. To make the readers acquainted with Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), the authors corroborate the detailed theoretical framework by establishing links with growing trends of cross continent migration, rising globalisation and expansion of multicultural and multiethnic contexts in the educational arena. A brief prehistory of CLIL has also been explored to justify its birth in helping out the linguists and educationists in Europe and beyond. The paper delineates the theory of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) diagrammatically employing content, cognition and communication in a linguistic culture. It explicates the various nomenclatures, dimensions, functions and the developmental stages of CLIL pedagogy at the dawn of the new millennium. After exploring the theoretical, functional and futuristic facets of CLIL, it is concluded that CLIL is an apt, economical and timely framework of bringing diverse cultures and languages closer to one another and can help build cosmopolitan identity of learners in the Knowledge Age.},

Through rounds of deductive and inductive coding and analysis, family language policies regarding English and/or French were compared with policies regarding heritage languages. The participantsâ family language policies were further examined in light of Quebecâs official language policy of interculturalism. Findings indicate a complex co-existence of family and official language policy in which parents both support Quebecâs official language policy by converging towards French as a common public language and questioning the policyâs stance on official institutional support for heritage languages.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the myth of childrenâs monolingual brain by conducting a case study of a two-year-old Saudi-American girl, who is in the two-word stage of vocalization, by focusing on a certain speech act, viz., âgreetingâ and demonstrating how it is heavily code-switched into Arabic/English language(s) with regard to the context of the speech and the greeter/receiver of the greeting identity. The subject has been raised in an English-speaking country milieu (United States of America), while she has been used to speaking Arabic at home. In this regard, the paper highlights the aim of the encoded usage of code-switching utterances in term of addressing the monolingual brain hypothesis. This qualitative study is based on open observations of two continues months of a toddler as the participant of this study aiming at exploring whether childrenâs greeting differ from those of adults and whether this greeting differs between two languages with regard to monolingual brain hypotheses. So far, the study concluded that greeting has never been mixed upon context, though utterances are code-switched. Moreover, the greeting process is comprehended and acquired within the language context as a pragmatic speech act regarding greeterâs identity, context, and gender. Findings of this study significantly support the cognitive approach in term of greeting via using a high frequent greeting word among the American culture. As would cognitive linguists suggest, greeting speech act response varies regarding how greeters of each community greet the subject, but not how they greet each otherâs in a community. Therefore, surprisingly the two-year-old subject perceptually recognizes the fact of receiving two different languages regardless to the monolingual hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals, in their foreign language, are spared from common decision-making biases. Typically, this âForeign Language Effectâ results in increased accuracy. We examined the Foreign Language Effect in the context of logical reasoning, in which reasoners are required to track the logical status of a syllogism, ignoring its believability. Across three experiments, we found the reverse Foreign Language Effect; foreign language reasoners are less able to evaluate the logical structure of syllogisms, but no less biased by their believability. One path to succeeding in reasoning tasks is always engaging in reflective processing. A more efficient strategy is metacognitively tracking whether belief-based intuitions conflict with logic-based intuitions and only reflecting when such conflict is present. We provide evidence that foreign language reasoners are less accurate because they struggle to detect belief-logic conflict, and in turn fail to engage in reflective processing when necessary to override the incorrect, intuitive response. We propose that foreign language reasoners are less able to detect belief-logic conflict either due to weakened intuitions or due to a more conservative threshold for the detection of conflict between multiple competing intuitions.

Two groups of children are considered: those born in the US (native born) and foreign-born children who immigrated prior to age 14 (the 1.5 generation). The analyses are conducted overall, within genders, and within racial and ethnic groups. Bilingualism is more prevalent if the parents are foreign born, less proficient in English, of the same ancestry (linguistic) group, and if the child lives in an ethnic (linguistic) concentration area. Although the effects are relatively smaller, a foreign-born grandparent living in the household increases child bilingualism, while a higher level of parental education tends to decrease it. Children of Asian and especially of Hispanic origin are more likely to be bilingual than their white, non-Hispanic counterparts. Native-born Indigenous children are more likely to be bilingual. native born children, bilingualism, immigrant children, family},

Native born bilingualism is rare; only 6.5 percent report a non-English language, and of those 71 percent report Spanish. Most of the native born bilinguals report speaking English "very well" (85 percent), with most of the others speaking it "well" (10 percent). Other variables the same, bilinguals earn 4.7 percent less than monolingual English speakers, but the earnings differential varies sharply by the language spoken. Those who speak Native American languages, Pennsylvania Dutch and Yiddish have very low earnings, likely because they live in isolated geographic or cultural enclaves.

We hypothesized that because trilinguals have reduced input in French and English due to time spent hearing their third language, they would have smaller FrenchâEnglish vocabulary sizes than bilinguals. Trilinguals produced on average 2/3 of the number of words in these languages that bilinguals did, however this difference was not statistically robust due to large levels of variability. Follow-up analyses did, however, indicate a relationship between input quantity and vocabulary size. Our results indicate that similar factors contribute to vocabulary development across toddlers regardless of the number of languages being acquired.},

	abstract = {Although understanding the role of the environment is central to language acquisition theory, rarely has this been studied for childrenâs phonetic development; and receptive and expressive language experiences in the environment are not distinguished. This last distinction may be crucial for child speech production in particular because production requires coordination of low-level speech-motor planning with high-level linguistic knowledge. In this study, the role of the environment is evaluated in a novel wayâby studying phonetic development in a bilingual community undergoing rapid language shift. This sociolinguistic context provides a naturalistic gradient of the amount of childrenâs exposure to two languages and the ratio of expressive to receptive experiences. A largescale child language corpus encompassing over 500 hours of naturalistic South Bolivian Quechua and Spanish speech was efficiently annotated for childrenâs and their caregiversâ bilingual language use. These estimates were correlated with childrenâs patterns in a series of speech production tasks. The role of the environment varied by outcome: childrenâs expressive language experience best predicted their performance on a coarticulation-morphology measure while their receptive experience predicted performance on a lower-level measure of vowel variability. Overall these bilingual exposure effects suggest a pathway for childrenâs role in language change whereby language shift can result in different learning outcomes within a single speech community. Appropriate ways to model language exposure in development are discussed.},

	abstract = {Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter volume (GMV) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GMV for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.},

Research consistently finds no negative effects of bilingualism and highlights the potential for positive effects across cognitive and socio-cultural domains for autistic and non-autistic children. Yet parents of autistic children remain concerned that bilingualism will cause delays in both cognitive and language development and are still frequently advised by practitioners to raise their child monolingually. Evidently, findings from research are not reflected in practice or subsequent advice, and it is essential to identify ways to ensure equal access to additional language learning.We briefly summarise the existing literature on bilingualism and autism, considering perspectives from the bilingual autistic community, and experimental research. We identify the most pertinent barriers to participation for autistic bilingual children in terms of familial, clinical and educational perspectives. We propose novel solutions to promote additional language learning, and suggest changes to practice that will contribute to an evidence base for families and practitioners. This commentary makes innovative recommendations at both the individual and societal level to ensure that autistic bilingual people have equal rights and opportunities to language learning and are optimally supported in accessing them.},

	abstract = {Background: At least 25\% of autistic children worldwide have the potential to grow up in a bilingual environment. However, many autistic children are being denied opportunities to access additional languages and the cultural, familial and community connections that come with this. There is little evidence identifying the barriers to language learning and access, and no research addressing the perspectives of practitioners, who are crucial in supporting parents to make informed choices about bilingualism with their child.Aims: The aim of this research was to understand the experiences of speech and language practitioners working with autistic bilingual children, to understand the main considerations when working with families, and the opportunities and barriers for training, including the sources of information that current practice is based on.Methods and Procedures: Twelve speech and language practitioners from across the UK were recruited for this study. All participants were experienced in working with autistic bilingual children and their families (M=7 years, Range 4-23 years). Semi-structured interviews were conducted and focused on the experiences of practitioners regarding familial bilingual experiences, the effect of socio-cultural factors of practice, and the extent to which practice is based on current research.Outcomes and Results: Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Three central themes were identified from the interviews: (1) participants discussed parental uncertainties as to whether they were doing the right thing for their child, (2) practitioners highlighted a need to shift towards a more inclusive and culturally diverse practice, (3) participants discussed the limited opportunities to access additional cultural training after they qualified, and the difficulty in keeping up to date with relevant, evidence-based research.Conclusions and implications: This is the first qualitative study to understand the perspectives of speech and language practitioners working with autistic bilingual children. We identify several key difficulties in supporting access to language learning, and these findings have immediate and longer-term implications for supporting practitioners, and in turn, the children, and families they support.},

	abstract = {Background: While being bilingual (knowing 2 or more languages) is becoming a more common experience globally, little is known about the combined experience of bilingualism and autism. Research currently available focuses on quantifying language and cognitive development, and the only two qualitative accounts of first-hand experiences are from either bilingual children or highly multilingual adults (with 4 languages or more), which may not represent the wider autistic bilingual population. All other accounts focus on parents or practitioners. This qualitative study reports the experiences of autistic bi- and multilingual adults, focusing on barriers and enablers to language learning and reported benefits of bilingualism.Methods: Thirty-nine UK-based autistic bilingual adults (41\% female, mean age = 33.2 years, range = 16-61) with knowledge of 2 to 7 languages (mean = 3.6, SD = 1.4) completed an online Demographic and Language Questionnaire including three open-ended questions about the interplay between autism and bilingualism. A thematic analysis was conducted on the responses to these open-ended questions.Results: Participants perceived many opportunities and benefits brought by bilingualism, in terms of relationships, hobbies, mobility, employment, education, and cultural insight. Respondents reported social communication as being a major benefit of being bilingual, and discussed how bilingualism had broadened their mindset, while identifying factors that had enabled or challenged their language learning journey.Conclusions: This study builds upon the few reports available to highlight experiences that are shared by autistic bilingual people regardless of the number of languages they know. It is the first study to report the perspectives of UK-based autistic bilingual adults who, in most cases, grew up in a bilingual environment.

	abstract = {This study examines whether different types of bilingualism modulate memory capacity differently. More specifically, the study assesses the effects of age of acquisition, number of languages acquired and proficiency in the L2 on phonological short-term memory, visuospatial memory and semantic memory.DesignMemory capacity was measured by means of three tasks: digit span task (phonological short-term memory), Corsi block task (visuospatial memory) and word span task (semantic memory). Participants were divided into five groups based on the number of languages acquired, age of acquisition and proficiency: monolinguals, intermediate L2 learners, advanced L2 learners, simultaneous bilinguals and multilinguals.Data and analysisAnalyses of variance were used to analyze participantsâ scores for each of the memory tasks.Findings and conclusionsFor the word span task, no significant differences were found among the groups, which supports the notion that semantic memory is language independent. Furthermore, intermediate and advanced L2 learners and multilinguals presented significantly higher phonological short-term memory spans compared to simultaneous bilinguals. Finally, intermediate L2 learners and multilinguals significantly outperformed monolinguals on visuospatial memory spans. Results suggest that L2 acquisition might strengthen both visuospatial and phonological short-term memory, which in turn tend to improve as L2 proficiency increases.OriginalityWhile previous studies have provided evidence of a bilingual advantage in memory capacity, these studies have generally grouped different types of bilinguals together (e.g., L2 leaners and heritage speakers). This study takes a step forward by examining differences on memory capacity across different types of bilinguals and in comparison to their monolingual peers in order to better understand the cognitive effects of bilingualism.Significance and implicationsWhen considering age of acquisition, number of languages acquired and proficiency as grouping factors, different effects of bilingualism on memory capacity can be observed. Future studies on this matter should include bilingual participants that are comparable with regard to the aforementioned variables.},

Still, little is known about the language markers of mental health for materials written in Spanish. This study collected pro-anorexia (pro-ana) public Tumblr blog posts written in Spanish and analyzed their content using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. Pro-ana-specific words, pronoun use, and psychological linguistic properties were analyzed, and results indicated that reasons for anorexia was the most frequently occurring category within pro-ana posts. Words in this category were associated with intense and negative emotions commonly found in trauma narratives in the dominant language (Spanish). Usersâ pronoun use suggested an increased focus on people and objects, which has been linked to decreased likelihood of recovery. The psychological properties of the posts had a negative emotional tone and were marked by significant use of ingestion and health words, signaling the symptoms of anorexia. This research points to benefits in assessing bilingual clients for anorexia behaviors, symptoms, and online-posting behaviors, while also revealing the need for improved evidence-based treatment for trauma in bilingual individuals, as well as the need for Spanish and code-switching blog norms to inform and advance future research.},

Hispanic adolescents engage in NSSI at rates similar to or higher than their Caucasian counterparts, but little research exists on Spanish-language markers of mental health. This study, harnessing data from the social media platform Tumblr, collected pro-NSSI public blog posts written in Spanish and analyzed their content with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software. Pro-NSSI linguistic properties, psychological linguistic properties, and signature words were analyzed, and results revealed that, of pro-NSSI terms, reasons for NSSI was the most frequently used category in posts. This result aligns with the literature because words associated with negative emotions are commonly presented in the dominant language within trauma narratives. Evaluation of linguistic properties indicated that users could be code-switching to avoid encountering overwhelming emotions, a practice common among bilingual individuals. The psychological properties of these blog posts had an emphatically negative emotional tone when written in Spanish and a more concrete and less emotionally charged tone when users switched to English. This research suggests benefits to assessing bilingual clients for pro-NSSI and online-posting behaviors, while underscoring both the need for improved evidence-based practices for treating trauma in bilingual clients and, broadly speaking, the importance of Spanish and code-switching norms for blogs and social media platforms.},

The analysis uses Swiss data from two administrative databases covering the universe of formal LTC providers between 2007 and 2013. Switzerland is a multi-cultural confederation where state administrative borders do not always coincide with cultural groups. For this reason, we exploit the within-state variation in cultural groups to show evidence about cultural differences in LTC use. In particular, we use spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) at the language border between French-speaking and German-speaking individuals living in bilingual cantons to provide causal interpretation of the differences in formal LTC use between these two main cultural groups. Our results suggest a strong role of culture in shaping household decisions about formal LTC use. In particular, elderly people residing in regions speaking a Latin language (French, Italian and Romansh) use home-based care services more intensely and enter in nursing homes at older ages and in worse health conditions with respect to elderly people in German regions. This difference across the two cultural groups are driven by different preferences towards LTC arrangements. Long-term care, Culture, Spatial RDD},

There is disagreement regarding whether conceptually-based language switching is also possible in the listening modality. For example, can bilingual listeners perceptually adjust to changes in pronunciation across languages based on their conceptual understanding of which language theyâre currently hearing? We asked French- and Spanish-English bilinguals to identify nonsense monosyllables as beginning with /b/ or /p/, speech categories that French and Spanish speakers pronounce differently than English speakers. We conceptually cued each bilingual group to one of their two languages or the other by explicitly instructing them that the speech items were word onsets in that language, uttered by a native speaker thereof. Both groups adjusted their /bâp/ identification boundary in accordance with this conceptual cue to the language context. These results support a bilingual model permitting conceptually-based language selection on both the speaking and listening end of a communicative exchange.},

They rate local news as "good" in general, but say it does only a "fair" job of covering their ethnic community. The most common complaint, brought up by more than half the blacks and nearly one-third of the Latinos is that TV news focuses on the bad things in their community and rarely reports the good. African-Americans are three times more likely than Latinos to say local TV news hurts race relations in the city, though the largest number said it makes no difference. The two groups watch about the same amount of local TV news, averaging 5.6 days a week. African-Americans are significantly more likely than Latinos to have a favorite anchor and show a strong preference for black anchors. While 80\% of the Latinos surveyed also watch Spanish-language local TV news, they watch it less often than English-language stations. Main Report Methdology Appendix},

We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually via the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, âvoicelessâ responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency.

Specifically, the study aims at answering two research questions: Why Saudi do parents chose to speak English to their child/children? And What are the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language: Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English â L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss of their Arabic L1 language. The study concludes that parents should provide a linguistic balance for their bilingual children in order to preserve the native language. Additionally, the study recommends that further parallel research studies with bilingual children of various L1(s), are conducted.},

	abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) in the processing of grammatical violations typically investigate differences between natives and second language speakers by averaging the amplitude of a participantâs brain response in a pre-specified time window by condition. This approach suffers from the problem that time windows are defined arbitrarily, and that the result is sensitive to outliers as well as participant variation in latency. The latter is particularly problematic for studies on L2 processing. The size of the ERP response (i.e., amplitude difference) of an L2 speaker may not be the best indicator of near-native proficiency, either, with the consistency of the response potentially being a more valid indicator. We introduce a set of individual difference measures based on complete ERP waveforms using generalized additive modelling (GAM), extracted based on amplitude, area and peak effects. We illustrate the benefits of our method compared to the traditional Response Magnitude Index with data on the processing of grammatical gender violations in 66 Slavic L2 speakers of German and 29 German native speakers. One of our measures in particular appears to outperform the others in characterizing differences between natives and L2 speakers, and captures proficiency differences between L2 speakers: the âNormalized Modelled Peakâ, reflecting the height of the (modelled) peak, normalized against the uncertainty of the modelled signal. This measure reflects peak robustness, that is, how reliable a P600 effect is found, largely independently of its latency in the P600 window. We discuss implications of our results and offer suggestions for future studies on L2 processing.},

Using the LENA recording system, each family contributed three full days of recordings within a one-month period. A portion of these recordings (945 minutes) were manually transcribed, and the word counts from these transcriptions were compared against the LENA-generated adult word counts.Results: Data analyses reveal that the LENA algorithms were reliable in counting words in both Canadian English and Canadian French, even when both languages are present in the same recording. While the LENA system tended to underestimate the amount of speech in the recordings, there was a strong correlation between the LENA-generated and human transcribed adult word counts for each language. Importantly, this relationship holds when accounting for different-gendered and different-accented speech.Conclusions: The LENA recording system is a reliable tool for estimating word counts, even for bilingual input. Special considerations and limitations for using the LENA recording system in a bilingual population are discussed. These results open up possibilities for investigating caregiver talk to bilingual infants in more detail.},

Purpose Drawing on B2B Relationship Marketing and management theory, this research seeks to better understand customer-perceived value in B2B contexts, specifically what customers expect from their relationships with suppliers. The study therefore aims to explore the customerâs perspective of the key attributes of relationships, in the software sector, and with specific reference to SMEs in this sector.Design/Method/Approach A two level analysis of customer perspectives on relationship attributes was conducted. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the customers of two case study firms. This process was used both to identify key attributes, and to generate insights into the nature and importance of those attributes. Using these attributes, a second study was conducted; a survey based on an online questionnaire generated data that was analysed using Adaptive Conjoint Analysis in order to identify the relative significance of the attributes. Findings A new Customer Relationship Attributes Model (CRAM) is presented which encapsulates the major attributes customers consider when entering into a relationship with their software supplier. The CRAM identifies five product-related attributes (price, functionality, bilingual capability, location, and software quality), and seven service related attributes (communication, understanding of the customer, trust, relationship, service, professionalism, and employee expertise). The most important of these attributes are: software quality, professionalism, understanding of the customer, and functionality. Originality/value Too much of the research and rhetoric on relationship marketing and management takes a provider side approach. This paper contributes to theory by offering a customer perspective on business relationships in a specific sector. Further, the CRAM can be used by software SMEs to inform the actions that they need to take in order to enhance their relationships with their customers in pursuit of improved business performance.},

	abstract = {While language competition models of diachronic language shift are increasingly sophisticated, drawing on sociolinguistic components like variable language prestige, distance from language centers and intermediate bilingual transitionary populations, in one significant way they fall short. They fail to consider contact-based outcomes resulting in mixed language practices, e.g. outcome scenarios such as creoles or unmarked code switching as an emergent communicative norm. On these lines something very interesting is uncovered in India, where traditionally there have been monolingual Hindi speakers and Hindi/English bilinguals, but virtually no monolingual English speakers. While the Indian census data reports a sharp increase in the proportion of Hindi/English bilinguals, we argue that the number of Hindi/English bilinguals in India is inaccurate, given a new class of urban individuals speaking a mixed lect of Hindi and English, popularly known as "Hinglish". Based on predator-prey, sociolinguistic theories, salient local ecological factors and the rural-urban divide in India, we propose a new mathematical model of interacting monolingual Hindi speakers, Hindi/English bilinguals and Hinglish speakers. The model yields globally asymptotic stable states of coexistence, as well as bilingual extinction. To validate our model, sociolinguistic data from different Indian classes are contrasted with census reports: We see that purported urban Hindi/English bilinguals are unable to maintain fluent Hindi speech and instead produce Hinglish, whereas rural speakers evidence monolingual Hindi. Thus we present evidence for the first time where an unrecognized mixed lect involving English but not "English", has possibly taken over a sizeable faction of a large global population.},

In Experiment 1, highly proficient DutchâEnglish bilinguals (N = 29) and English monolinguals (N = 30) judged the semantic relatedness of word pairs that included a cognate (e.g. âwolfâââhowlâ; n = 50), an interlingual homograph (e.g. âangelâââheavenâ; n = 50) or an English control word (e.g. âcarrotâââvegetableâ; n = 50). In Experiment 2, another group of highly proficient DutchâEnglish bilinguals (N = 101) read sentences in Dutch that contained one of those cognates, interlingual homographs or the Dutch translation of one of the English control words (e.g. âwortelâ for âcarrotâ) approximately 15 minutes prior to completing the English semantic relatedness task.Results. In Experiment 1, there was an interlingual homograph inhibition effect of 39 ms only for the bilinguals, but no evidence for a cognate facilitation effect. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and also revealed that cross-lingual long-term priming had an opposite effect on the cognates and interlingual homographs: recent experience with a cognate in Dutch speeded processing of those items 15 minutes later in English but slowed processing of interlingual homographs. However, these priming effects were smaller than previously observed using a lexical decision task.Conclusion. After comparing our results to studies in both the bilingual and monolingual domain, we argue that bilinguals appear to process cognates and interlingual homographs as monolinguals process polysemes and homonyms, respectively. In the monolingual domain, processing of such words is best modelled using distributed connectionist frameworks. We conclude that it is necessary to explore the viability of such a model for the bilingual case.Data, scripts, materials and pre-registrations.

	abstract = {Poort, Warren and Rodd (2016) showed that bilinguals profit from recent experience with an identical cognate in their native language when they encounter the same word in their second language. We conducted two experiments employing the same cross-lingual long-term priming paradigm to determine whether this is also the case for non-identical cognates, as this would indicate they share an orthographic representation in the bilingual lexicon. In Experiment 1, DutchâEnglish bilinguals read Dutch sentences containing identical cognates (e.g. âwinterâââwinterâ), non-identical cognates (e.g. âbaardâââbeardâ) or the Dutch translations (e.g. âfietsâ) of English control words (e.g. âbikeâ). These words were presented again in an English lexical decision task approximately 19 minutes later. The analysis revealed only weak evidence, based both on p-values and Bayes factors, for a small 6-9 ms facilitative priming effect. Experiment 2 aimed to determine whether including interlingual homographs (e.g. âangelâââangelâ) in the experiment modulates the size of the priming effect. This time, the analysis revealed no evidence for a priming effect, either based on p-values or Bayes factors, in either version of the experiment for either the cognates or the interlingual homographs. In line with previous findings (Poort \& Rodd, 2017, May 9), we did find strong evidence for an interlingual homograph inhibition effect and no evidence for a cognate facilitation effect. We conclude that, since the cross-lingual long-term priming effect is largely semantic in nature, the lexical decision tasks we used were not sensitive enough to detect an effect of priming.},

He found that, other things being equal, indigenous people who acquire more human capital enjoy greater economic rewards than those who acquire less. Just giving ethnic groups basic education is bound to improve their position. This finding was supported by both within country and cross-country evidence: indigenous people fare better in Bolivia (where there is more education) than in Guatemala (where there is less). One possible (although controversial) intervention is to provide schooling in the child's first language. Such an intervention has been successfully implemented on a small scale in Guatemala.

In bilingual contexts, these strategies influence childrenâs language exposure and development (Macleod et al., 2022). In the more complex context of trilingualism, how families settle on strategies and their relationship with exposure may differ. Here, we studied 31 families raising trilingual toddlers aged 18-36 months living in Montreal with English, French â the cityâs two community languages â and various heritage languages. Familiesâ language strategy and language background, childrenâs exposure, and parentsâ attitudes and concerns towards childrenâs trilingualism were assessed. The most frequent strategies adopted involved mixed use of a community and heritage language with children. Strategies that excluded the community languages at home were associated with lower parent proficiency in the community languages and higher heritage language exposure. Mixed strategies led to more balanced exposure to the three languages. Attitudes towards trilingualism were favorable, concerns were weak, and neither showed a relationship with family language strategy choice. These findings shed new light on unique features of trilingual language environments and open future directions for research on how they relate to the development of three languages.},

	abstract = {Children have an early ability to learn and comprehend words, a skill that develops as they age. A critical question remains regarding what drives this development. Maturation-based theories emphasise cognitive maturity as a driver of comprehension, while accumulator theories emphasise childrenâs accumulation of language experience over time. In this study we used archival looking-while-listening data from 155 children aged 14â48 months with a range of exposure to the target languages (from 10\% to 100\%) to evaluate the relative contributions of maturation and experience. We compared four statistical models of noun learning: maturation-only, experience-only, additive (maturation plus experience), and accumulator (maturation times experience). The best-fitting model was the additive model in which both maturation (age) and experience were independent contributors to noun comprehension: older children as well as children who had more experience with the target language were more accurate and looked faster to the target in the looking-while-listening task. A 25\% change in relative language exposure was equivalent to a 4 month change in age, and age effects were stronger at younger than at older ages. Whereas accumulator models predict that the lexical development of children with less exposure to a language (as is typical in bilinguals) should fall further and further behind children with more exposure to a language (such as monolinguals), our results indicate that bilinguals are buffered against effects of reduced exposure in each language. This study shows that continuous-level measures from individual childrenâs looking-while-listening data, gathered from children with a range of language experience, provide a powerful window into lexical development.},

	abstract = {The ability to differentiate between two languages sets the stage for bilingual learning. Infants can discriminate languages when hearing long passages, but language switches often occur on short time scales with few cues to language identity. As bilingual infants begin learning sequences of sounds and words, how do they detect the dynamics of two languages? In two studies using the head-turn preference procedure, we investigated whether infants (n = 44) can discriminate languages at the level of individual words. In Study 1, monolingual and bilingual 8- to 12-month-olds were tested on their detection of single-word language switching in lists of words (e.g., âdogâ¦ lait [fr. milk]â). In Study 2, they were tested on language switching within sentences (e.g., âDo you like the lait?â). Infants detected language switching within sentences, but not in lists of words. Moreover, there was no difference between bilingual and monolingual infantsâ performance. Based on these contrasting effects for natural sentences versus lists of words, we conclude that infants may detect language switches more successfully if preceded by sequences of sounds and words in a single language. The ability to detect disruptions in such sequences is likely important in supporting the beginnings of bilingual proficiency.},

The dataset comprises responses to a language environment questionnaire, and scores on a sentence comprehension task and a sentence recall task in the bilingualsâ two languages. Questionnaire data revealed a richer Mandarin language environment for children in the COVID group compared to peers in the pre-COVID group. On both comprehension and production tasks, the two groups performed comparably in English but the COVID group showed better performance in Mandarin than the pre-COVID group. Within the pre-COVID group, English was stronger than Mandarin in both comprehension and production. Within the COVID group, the two languages were balanced in comprehension and Mandarin was stronger than English in production. Moreover, language use variables were correlated with production performance in both languages.

This study aimed to determine whether structural priming may have a part in the unconventional variation observed in subject pronoun use in Turkish in contact with Dutch. Twenty-eight Turkish-Dutch bilinguals listened to short stories and responded to subsequently presented instructive sentences. These sentences were prime sentences, which contained either an overt or a null subject pronoun. Priming effects were investigated in monolingual and bilingual settings by presenting the stories in Turkish in the former and in Dutch in the latter. Results yielded a higher likelihood of using overt subject pronouns in the bilingual than in the monolingual setting following a prime sentence with an overt rather than a null pronoun. Our findings, which are based on a structure and a language that have not yet been studied much in relation to structural priming (i.e., subject pronoun use in Turkish), strengthen the empirical basis of how structural priming influences syntactic choices in language contact settings.},

Using voxel-based morphometry, our primary goal was to identify and explore differences in regional patterns of grey matter sensitivity to performance on the sentence interpretation task, controlling for group variability in age, nonverbal reasoning and vocabulary knowledge. There was no group difference in performance but there was a significant group effect in grey matter sensitivity to task performance in our region of interest: stronger sensitivity in the paravermis in bilinguals compared to monolinguals in accuracy performance in the high (relative to low) verbal interference condition. This effect was observed when the linguistic interference was presented in an unfamiliar language (Greek) but not when presented in the familiar language (English). Our findings suggest that multilanguage acquisition mediates regional involvement within the language network, conferring enhanced functional plasticity within structures (including the paravermis) in the service of control of linguistic interference.},

The problem of detecting indications of interference becomes especially relevant, which is explained by many reasons, among them vague language and translation training of the translator, which is what causes the indications of harmful interference in intercultural communication and translation. Clarifying the indications of interference as a communicative barrier due to the convergence of linguistic and cultural codes of the contacting languages ââwill ensure a successful process of intercultural communication and translation. It will promote the development of relevant, significant professional translation activities in translators. When learning a language, try to find similarities or differences in language structures to better explain errors in differences or master the material by comparing the similarities of language structures. In intercultural communication and translation, the main aim is to convey information to the reader or listener in the most natural way possible, using all known stylistic, grammatical, lexical, and grammatical means. This research was conducted based on the methods of observation, comparison, analysis, functional and descriptive methods. In order to solve this problem, the achievements of linguistics, sociolinguistics, psychology, psycholinguistics, methods of teaching foreign languages were analyzed, as the study of the phenomenon of interference is based on them. The result is the formation of a linguistic personality, in particular, the bilingual personality of the translator in a dialogue that has the ability and skills to use the language in all its manifestations in different situations of intercultural communication; the ability to understand and assimilate someone else's way of life and behavior in order to break ingrained stereotypes; skills to expand the individual picture of the world by involving in the "language picture of the world" speakers of the studied language.Some prospects for further explorations in the development of a direct model of the bilingual personality of a translator in the context of intercultural dialogue and methods of linguistic and cultural formation competencies of translators in the aspect of mastering linguistic and cultural knowledge, skills and abilities in the studied areas of communication.},

Here, we approach this issue using a novel application of Network Science to map the conversational topics that MontrÃ©al bilinguals discuss across communicative contexts (e.g., work, home, family, school, social), in their dominant vs. non-dominant language. Our results demonstrate that all communicative contexts display a unique pattern in which conversational topics are discussed, but only a few communicative contexts (work and social) display a unique pattern of how many languages are used to discuss particular topics. We also demonstrate that the dominant language has greater network size, strength, and density than the non-dominant language, suggesting that more topics are used in a wider variety of contexts in this language. Lastly, using community detection to thematically group the topics in each language, we find evidence of greater specificity in the non-dominant language than the dominant language. We contend that Network Science is a valuable tool for representing complex information, such as individual differences in bilingual language use, in a rich and granular manner, that may be used to better understand brain and behavior.},

Infants were later trained to predict a different reward on the left based on another set of new rule structure (ABB pattern). Correct anticipation of reward locations indicates successful learning. If bilingualism improves infantsâ cognitive skills, bilingual infants would be better at learning a new pattern-reward association. However, we did not find evidence that bilinguals looked at the correct location more than monolinguals or learned the new pattern-reward association faster.

	abstract = {Prior studies using the event-related potential (ERP) technique show that integrating sentential code-switches in online processing lead to a broadly distributed late positivity component while processing semantically unexpected continuations instead lead to the emergence of an N400 effect. While the N400 is generally assumed to index lexico-semantic processing, the LPC has two different interpretations. One account suggests that it reflects the processing of an improbable or unexpected event while an alternative account proposes sentence-level reanalysis. To investigate the relative costs of semantic to language-based unexpectancies (i.e., code-switches), the current study tests 24 Spanish-English bilinguals in an ERP reading study. Semantically constrained Spanish frames either varied in their semantic expectancy (high vs low expectancy) and/or their language continuation (same language vs code-switch) while participantsâ electrophysiological responses were recorded. The Spanish-to-English switch direction provides a more naturalistic test for integration costs to code-switching as it better approximates the code-switching practices of the target population. Analyses across three time windows show a main effect for semantic expectancy in the N400 time window and a main effect for code-switching in the LPC time window. Additional analyses based on the self-reported code-switching experience of the participants suggested an early positivity linked to less experience with code-switching. The results suggest that not all code-switches lead to similar integration costs and that prior experience with code-switching is an important additional factor that modulates online processing.},

Does the L1 elicit a significantly stronger emotional arousal or can salient second language experience generate comparably strong associations between emotions and the L2? These questions were addressed through two measures of emotional arousal, (online) skin conductance responses (SCR) and (offline) emotionality ratings. Russian-English late bilinguals, UK university students, were presented different types of university-related expressions in English and Russian. The vocabulary types were university-related emotionally-laden expressions (âÐÐ»Ð°Ð³Ð¸Ð°Ñâ/âPlagiarismâ) and neutral words (âÐÑÑÐ³â/âCircleâ). Two main results emerged. First, in L1, SCRs showed a significantly increased electro-dermal activity when participants reacted to university-related words. Emotionality ratings showed contrasts based on stimulus type in both languages. These results indicate that university-related words qualify as a category of emotionally charged expressions. Second, between-language tests showed that electrodermal reactivity was not more reduced in L2 than in L1, which was also mirrored in emotionality ratings. These findings are located within the existing empirical context, and alternative interpretations are provided to further our understanding of how an emotionally salient L2 context contributes to shifts from mother tongue dominance to an increased emotional power of the second language.},

	abstract = {Bilinguals often codeswitch between languages mid-sentence. Do incongruent codeswitches, which follow the word order of only one language, occur? If so, how do bilinguals comprehend them, given the clash in grammaticality? First, we demonstrated that incongruent codeswitches occur, based on a corpus analysis of Spanish-English speech. Then, we measured bilingualsâ assessments of congruent codeswitches (Experiment 1) and incongruent codeswitches (Experiment 2) using an offline rating task. This task was sensitive to codeswitching costs and grammaticality. More importantly, the ratings for incongruent codeswitches supported the Current Word hypothesis, which predicts that codeswitches follow the word order of the language of the current word, but not the Matrix Language hypothesis (Myers-Scotton, 2002). These results can be understood within a bilingual comprehension theory in which activation spreads from words in the input to language-independent grammatical structures, leading bilinguals to make language-independent predictions about the syntactic category of upcoming words.},

	abstract = {In oneâs native language, visual word identification is based on early morphological analysis and is sensitive to the statistical structure of the mapping between form and meaning (OrthographyâtoâSemantic Consistency, OSC). How these mechanisms apply to a second language is much less clear. We recruited L1 ItalianâL2 English speakers for a masked priming task where the relationship between prime and target was morphologically transparent, e.g., employerâEMPLOY, morphologically opaque, e.g., corner-CORN, or merely orthographic, e.g., brothelâBROTH. Critically, participants underwent thorough testing of their lexical, morphological, phonological, spelling, and semantic proficiency in their second language. By exploring a wide spectrum of L2 proficiency, we showed that this factor critically qualifies L2 priming. Genuine morphological facilitation only arises as proficiency grows, while orthographic priming shrinks as L2 competence increases. OSC was also found to modulate priming and interact with proficiency, providing an alternative way of describing the transparency continuum in derivational morphology. Overall, these data illustrate the trajectory towards a fully consolidated L2 lexicon and show that masked priming and sensitivity to OSC are key trackers of this process.},

	abstract = {Morphological knowledge is known to be positively associated with reading ability. However, whether morphological knowledge affects childrenâs learning of new orthographic representations is less clear. Purpose: This study aims to investigate morphological effects on orthographic learning, and whether this effect, if any, is different for monolingual compared to Chinese-English-speaking bilingual children, who often have difficulty acquiring English morphology.Method: A total of 59 Year 2 children, including 29 English-speaking monolinguals and 30 Chinese-English-speaking bilinguals participated. We assessed childrenâs pre-existing inflectional morphological knowledge. The children learned twelve novel words that were either presented with morphological variation (e.g., vack, vacks, vacking, vacked) or pure repetition (e.g., vack x 4). Orthographic learning was measured by orthographic choice and spelling tasks. Results: 1) the monolinguals had better inflectional morphological knowledge than the bilinguals; 2) there were no differences in orthographic learning between the monolinguals and bilinguals; 3) orthographic learning was better in the repetition condition, but only evident in the spelling task. Conclusion: Chinese-English-speaking bilingualsâ weaker morphological knowledge does not seem to hinder their orthographic learning ability. We also provide initial evidence that novel written words are learned better when they are presented without morphological variation, supporting the item-based feature of the self-teaching hypothesis.},

Relying on a range of statistical techniques, the results across three experiments testing three different groups of bilinguals (i.e., Dutch-English, Arabic-English, and Chinese-English) showed no clear interaction between language switch costs and Stroop incongruency, and neither was this pattern influenced by language dominance. These results are more in line with the claim that different controlprocesses are implemented to reduce cross- and within-language interference.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/yqp8t},
	abstract = {The accumulating evidence suggests that prior usage of a second language (L2) leads to processing costs on the subsequent production of a native language (L1). However, it is unclear mechanism underlies this effect. It has been proposed that the L1 cost reflects inhibition of L1 representation acting during L1 production; however, previous studies exploring this issue were inconclusive. It is also unsettled whether the mechanism operates on the whole-language level or is restricted to translation equivalents in the two languages. We report a study that allowed us to address both issues behaviorally with the use of ERPs while focusing on the consequences of using L2 on the production of L1. In our experiment, native speakers of Polish (L1) and learners of English (L2) named a set of pictures in L1 following a set of pictures in either L1 or L2. Half of the pictures were repeated from the preceding block and half were new; this enabled dissociation of the effects on the level of the whole language from those specific to individual lexical items. Our results are consistent with the notion that language after-effects operate at a whole-language level. Behaviorally, we observed a clear processing cost on the whole-language level and a small facilitation on the item-specific level. The whole-language effect was accompanied by an enhanced, fronto-centrally distributed negativity in the 250â350ms time-window which we identified as the N300 (in contrast to previous research, which probably misidentified the effect as the N2), a component that presumably reflects retrieval difficulty of relevant language representations during picture naming. As such, unlike previous studies that reported N2 for naming pictures in L1 after L2 use, we propose that the reported ERPs (N300) indicate that prior usage of L2 hampers lexical access to names in L1. Based on the literature, the after-effects could be caused by L1 inhibition and/or L2 interference, but the ERPs so far have not been informative about the causal mechanism.},

To investigate how bilinguals monitor their speech errors and control their languages in use, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in unbalanced Dutch-English bilingual speakers in a cued language-switching task. We tested the conflict-based monitoring model by investigating the error-related negativity (ERN) and comparing the effects of the two switching directions (i.e., to the first language, L1 vs. to the second language, L2). Results show that the speakers made more language selection errors when switching from their L2 to the L1 than vice versa. In the EEG, we observed a robust ERN effect following language selection errors compared to correct responses, reflecting monitoring of speech errors. Most interestingly, the ERN effect was enlarged when the speakers were switching to their L2 (less conflict) compared to switching to the L1 (more conflict). Our findings do not support the conflict-based monitoring model. We discuss an alternative account in terms of error prediction and reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {Early evaluation of word reading skills is an important step in understanding and predicting childrenâs future literacy abilities. Traditionally, word reading evaluations are conducted using âstaticâ assessments (SA), which measure a childâs acquired knowledge and are prone to floor effects. Additionally, many of these tools are developed exclusively for English monolinguals, and therefore cannot be used equitably to evaluate the abilities of bilingual children. Dynamic assessment (DA), which evaluates the ability to learn a skill, is a potentially more equitable alternative. To establish that use of DAs is a valid alternative to traditional SAs, their concurrent agreement with gold standard SA measures and their predictive agreement with later word reading outcomes should be considered. In line with this, the primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the concurrent and predictive validity of DAs of word reading skills. Two secondary objectives are (i) to address which types of word reading DAs (phonological awareness, sound-symbol knowledge, or decoding) demonstrate the strongest relationships with equivalent concurrent static measures and later word reading outcomes, and (ii) to consider for which populations, defined by language status (monolingual vs. bilingual vs. mixed) and reading status (typically developing vs. at-risk vs. mixed) these DAs are valid. Thirty-four studies from 32 papers were identified through searching 5 databases, and the grey literature. Included studies provided a correlation between a DA and concurrent SA, or a DA and a later word reading outcome measure. Regarding concurrent validity, we observed a strong relationship between DAs and SAs in general (r=.60); however, subgroup analyses indicate that DAs of decoding (r=.54) and phonological awareness (r=.73) measures demonstrate greater strength of correlation with their static counterparts, compared to DAs of sound-symbol knowledge (r=.34). In terms of predictive validity, we observed a similarly strong relationship between DAs and word reading outcome measures (r=.57), independently of the type of measure. Subgroup analyses conducted based on participant language status suggested that there are significant differences between mean effect sizes for monolingual, bilingual and mixed language groups in terms of DAsâ concurrent validity with SAs, but no significant differences for predictive validity with word reading outcome measures. There were also no significant differences between mean effect sizes for at-risk, typically developing, or mixed groups in terms of DAs concurrent validity with SAs or predictive validity with word reading outcome measures. Results provide preliminary evidence to suggest that DAs of phonological awareness and decoding skills are a valid alternative to SAs of equivalent constructs and are valid for the future prediction of word reading outcomes across population groups regardless of their language or reading status.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis systematic review and meta-analysis is funded by a Canada Graduate Scholarship-Masterâs grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, at the Rehabilitation Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto and an Ontario Graduate Scholarship from the Ministry of Colleges and Universities, awarded to E.

	abstract = {Background Reading and language skills are important and known to be heritable, and dyslexia and developmental language disorder are commonly recognized learning difficulties worldwide. However, the genetic basis underlying these skills remains poorly understood. In particular, most previous genetic studies were performed on Westerners. To our knowledge, few or no previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted on literacy skills in Chinese as a native language or English as a second language (ESL) in a Chinese population.Methods We conducted GWAS and related bioinformatics analyses on 34 reading/language-related phenotypes in Hong Kong Chinese bilingual children (including both twins and singletons; N=1046). We performed association tests at the single-variant, gene, pathway levels, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to explore how imputed expression changes might affect the phenotypes. In addition, we tested genetic overlap of these cognitive traits with other neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as cognitive performance (CP) and educational attainment (EA) using polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis.Results Totally 9 independent loci (LD-clumped at r2=0.01) reached genome-wide significance (p{\textless}5e-08) (filtered by imputation quality metric Rsq{\textgreater}0.3 and having at least 2 correlated SNPs(r2{\textgreater}0.5) with p{\textless}1e-3). The loci were associated with a range of language/literacy traits such as Chinese vocabulary, character and word reading, dictation and rapid digit naming, as well as English lexical decision. Several SNPs from these loci mapped to genes that were reported to be associated with intelligence, EA other neuropsychiatric phenotypes, such as MANEA, TNR, PLXNC1 and SHTN1. We also revealed significantly enriched genes and pathways based on SNP-based analysis. In PRS analysis, EA and CP showed significant polygenic overlap with a variety of language traits, especially English literacy skills. ADHD PRS showed a significant association with English vocabulary score.Conclusions This study revealed numerous genetic loci that may be associated with Chinese and English abilities in a group of Chinese bilingual children.

Children completed the tasks in the auditory modality in each of their languages during functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging. Cross-linguistically, comparisons between bilinguals' two languages revealed that the task that was more central to reading in a given orthography, such as phonological awareness (PA) in English and MA in Chinese, elicited less activation in the left inferior frontal and parietal regions. Group comparisons between bilinguals and monolinguals in English, their shared language of academic instruction, revealed that the left inferior frontal was less active during phonology but more active during morphology in bilinguals relative to monolinguals. MA skills are generally considered to have greater language specificity than PA skills. Bilingual literacy training in a skill that is maximally similar across languages, such as PA, may therefore yield greater automaticity for this skill, as reflected in the lower activation in bilinguals relative to monolinguals. This interpretation is supported by negative correlations between proficiency and brain activation. Together, these findings suggest that both the structural characteristics and literacy experiences with a given language can exert specific influences on bilingual and monolingual children's emerging brain networks for learning to read.

To uncover sources of such heterogeneity in children's neural language networks, the present study examined the effects of bilingual proficiency on children's neural organization for language function. To do so, we took an innovative person-specific analytical approach to investigate young Chinese-English and Spanish-English bilingual learners of structurally distinct languages. Bilingual and English monolingual children (N = 152, M(SD)age = 7.71(1.32)) completed an English word recognition task during functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging, along with language and literacy tasks in each of their languages. Two key findings emerged. First, bilinguals' heritage language proficiency (Chinese or Spanish) made a unique contribution to children's language network density. Second, the findings reveal common and unique patterns in children's patterns of task-related functional connectivity. Common across all participants were short-distance neural connections within left hemisphere regions associated with semantic processes (within middle temporal and frontal regions). Unique to more proficient language users were additional long-distance connections between frontal, temporal, and bilateral regions within the broader language network. The study informs neurodevelopmental theories of language by revealing the effects of heterogeneity in language proficiency and experiences on the structure and quality of emerging language neural networks in linguistically diverse learners.

	abstract = {Longitudinal studies provide the unique opportunity to test whether early language provides a scaffolding for the acquisition of the ability to read. This study tests the hypothesis that parental language input during the first 2 years of life predicts emergent literacy skills at 5 years of age, and that white matter development observed early in the 3rd year (at 26 months) may help to account for these effects. We collected naturalistic recordings of parent and child language at 6, 10, 14, 18, and 24 months using the Language ENvironment Analysis system (LENA) in a group of typically developing infants. We then examined the relationship between language measures during infancy and follow-up measures of reading related skills at age 5 years, in the same group of participants (N = 53). A subset of these children also completed diffusion and quantitative MRI scans at age 2 years (N = 20). Within this subgroup, diffusion tractography was used to identify white matter pathways that are considered critical to language and reading development, namely, the arcuate fasciculus (AF), superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi, and inferior occipital-frontal fasciculus. Quantitative macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) mapping was used to characterize myelin density within these separately defined regions of interest. The longitudinal data were then used to test correlations between early language input and output, white matter measures at age 2 years, and pre-literacy skills at age 5 years. Parental language input, child speech output, and parent-child conversational turns correlated with pre-literacy skills, as well as myelin density estimates within the left arcuate and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Mediation analyses indicated that the left AF accounted for longitudinal relationships between infant home language measures and 5-year letter identification and letter-sound knowledge, suggesting that the left AF myelination at 2 years may serve as a mechanism by which early language experience supports emergent literacy.

The previous study explored the influence of a bilingual environment in the first months of life on resting-state functional connectivity and reported no significant difference between language groups., Methods: To further explore the influence of a bilingual environment on brain development function, we used the resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy public dataset of the 4-month-old infant group in the sleep state (30 Spanish; 33 Basque; 36 bilingual). Wavelet Transform Coherence, graph theory, and Granger causality methods were performed on the functional connectivity of the frontal lobes., Results: The results showed that functional connectivity strength was significantly higher in the left hemisphere than that in the right hemisphere in both monolingual and bilingual groups. The graph theoretic analysis showed that the characteristic path length was significantly higher in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere for the bilingual infant group. Contrary to the monolingual infant group, the left-to-right direction of information flow was found in the frontal regions of the bilingual infant group in the effective connectivity analysis., Discussion: The results suggested that the left hemispheric lateralization of functional connectivity in frontal regions is more pronounced in the bilingual group compared to the monolingual group.

	abstract = {Parental input is considered a key predictor of language achievement during the first years of life, yet relatively few studies have assessed the effects of parental language input and parent-infant interactions on early brain development. We examined the relationship between measures of parent and child language, obtained from naturalistic home recordings at child ages 6, 10, 14, 18, and 24 months, and estimates of white matter myelination, derived from quantitative MRI at age 2 years (mean = 26.30 months, SD = 1.62, N = 22). Analysis of the white matter focused on dorsal pathways associated with expressive language development and long-term language ability, namely, the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). Frequency of parent-infant conversational turns (CT) uniquely predicted myelin density estimates in both the AF and SLF. Moreover, the effect of CT remained significant while controlling for total adult speech and child speech-related utterances, suggesting a specific role for interactive language experience, rather than simply speech exposure or production. An exploratory analysis of 18 additional tracts, including the right AF and SLF, indicated a high degree of anatomic specificity. Longitudinal analyses of parent and child language variables indicated an effect of CT as early as 6 months of age, as well as an ongoing effect over infancy. Together, these results link parent-infant conversational turns to white matter myelination at age 2 years, and suggest that early, interactive experiences with language uniquely contribute to the development of white matter associated with long-term language ability. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Children's earliest experiences with language are thought to have profound and lasting developmental effects. Recent studies suggest that intervention can increase the quality of parental language input and improve children's learning outcomes. However, important questions remain about the optimal timing of intervention, and the relationship between specific aspects of language experience and brain development. We report that parent-infant turn-taking during home language interactions correlates with myelination of language related white matter pathways through age 2 years. Effects were independent of total speech exposure and infant vocalizations and evident starting at 6 months of age, suggesting that structured language interactions throughout infancy may uniquely support the ongoing development of brain systems critical to long-term language ability.

	abstract = {Additional neural substance for reading in a second language has been reported by prior studies. However, to date, there has been little investigation into whether and how the brain's adaptation to a second language is induced by specific linguistic tasks or is a general effect during reading in a new language. To address this issue, our study investigated Chinese children learning English as a second language by combining cross-sectional and longitudinal Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies. We compared brain activation across four reading tasks, orthographic tasks and phonological tasks in Chinese (the first language, L1) and English (the second language, L2). By comparing the activation pattern across languages, we observed greater activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) in English compared to Chinese, suggesting a functional preference of the LIPL to L2. In addition, greater correlation between LIPL-related FC and L2 was mainly observed in the phonological task, indicating that LIPL could be associated with phonological processing. Moreover, a proportion of the children were enrolled in an 8-week phonological-based reading-training program. We observed significant functional plasticity of the LIPL elicited by this training program only in the English phonological task and not in the orthographic task, further substantiating that the additional requirements of the LIPL in L2 are mainly associated with phonological processing. The findings provide new insights into understanding the functional contribution of the LIPL to reading in a second language. Copyright Â© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Dual language acquisition can yield common influences that may be shared across different bilingual groups, as well as language-specific influences stemming from a given language pairing. To investigate these effects, we examined bilingual English speakers of Chinese or Spanish, and English monolinguals, all raised in the US (N = 152, ages 5-10). Children completed an English morphological word processing task during fNIRS neuroimaging. The findings revealed both language-specific and shared bilingual effects. The language-specific effects were that Chinese and Spanish bilinguals showed principled differences in their neural organization for English lexical morphology. The common bilingual effects shared by the two groups were that in both bilingual groups, increased home language proficiency was associated with stronger left superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation when processing the English word structures that are most dissimilar from the home language. The findings inform theories of language and brain development during the key periods of neural reorganization for learning to read by illuminating experience-based plasticity in linguistically diverse learners.

We found greater similarity between L1 and L2 in adults than in children, supporting the convergence hypothesis which argues that when the proficiency of L2 increases, the L2's brain network converges to the L1's brain network. We also found greater differences between adults and children in the brain for L2 processing than L1 processing, even though there were comparable increase in proficiency from children to adults in L1 and L2. It suggests an elongated developmental course for L2. This study provides important insights about developmental changes in the bilingual brain.

	doi = {10.1117/1.NPh.8.2.025011},
	abstract = {Significance: Early monolingual versus bilingual experience induces adaptations in the development of linguistic and cognitive processes, and it modulates functional activation patterns during the first months of life. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is a convenient approach to study the functional organization of the infant brain. RSFC can be measured in infants during natural sleep, and it allows to simultaneously investigate various functional systems. Adaptations have been observed in RSFC due to a lifelong bilingual experience. Investigating whether bilingualism-induced adaptations in RSFC begin to emerge early in development has important implications for our understanding of how the infant brain's organization can be shaped by early environmental factors. Aims: We attempt to describe RSFC using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and to examine whether it adapts to early monolingual versus bilingual environments. We also present an fNIRS data preprocessing and analysis pipeline that can be used to reliably characterize RSFC in development and to reduce false positives and flawed results interpretations. Methods: We measured spontaneous hemodynamic brain activity in a large cohort ( N = 99 ) of 4-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants using fNIRS. We implemented group-level approaches based on independent component analysis to examine RSFC, while providing proper control for physiological confounds and multiple comparisons. Results: At the group level, we describe the functional organization of the 4-month-old infant brain in large-scale cortical networks. Unbiased group-level comparisons revealed no differences in RSFC between monolingual and bilingual infants at this age. Conclusions: High-quality fNIRS data provide a means to reliably describe RSFC patterns in the infant brain. The proposed group-level RSFC analyses allow to assess differences in RSFC across experimental conditions. An effect of early bilingual experience in RSFC was not observed, suggesting that adaptations might only emerge during explicit linguistic tasks, or at a later point in development.

Four groups of participants: monolingual English children, bilingual Chinese-English children, bilingual Chinese-English adults and monolingual English adults were given an agent selection syntactic processing task. Bilingual child participants were classified as simultaneous or sequential bilinguals to examine the impact of first language, age of second-language acquisition (AoL2A), and the length of second language experience on behavioral performance and cortical activation. Participants were asked to select the agent of four types of sentences: subject-verb-object (SVO), passive (PAS), subject-extracted relative clause (SR), and object-extracted relative clause (OR) adopted from the "Whatdunit" task by Montgomery et al. (2016). Semantic cues were removed by using inanimate nouns for agents and patients, which constrained participants to make decisions based on syntactic knowledge. Behavioral results showed greater accuracy for canonical SVO and SR sentence types than for noncanonical OR and PAS sentence types, which aligns with prior studies. Neuroimaging results revealed greater hemodynamic responses to relative clauses (i.e., SR and OR sentences) than to simple sentences (SVO and PAS), especially for Chinese-English bilinguals suggesting first-language transfer influencing sentence processing in English. The effects AoL2A and the length of second language experience showed no significant differences between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals or between bilingual adults and children for identifying the correct agent in each sentence. However, neuroimaging results demonstrated greater hemodynamic responses in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in simultaneous bilinguals compared to sequential bilinguals and greater hemodynamic responses in left and right DLPFC and left IPL among bilingual adults. Different behavioral and neural hemodynamic response patterns afford new insights into the effects of syntactic knowledge on sentence processing.

	abstract = {The home language and literacy environment (HLLE) in infancy has been associated with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLLE at preschool-age has been shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve pre-reading and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with both HLLE and white matter organization. It is important to understand whether the relationships between environmental factors such as HLLE and SES and white matter organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized that HLLE (1) relates to white matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2) mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses, infants (mean age: 8.6 +/- 2.3 months, N = 38) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging MRI during natural sleep. Image processing was performed with an infant-specific pipeline and fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) bilaterally using the baby automated fiber quantification method. HLLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the StimQ (StimQ-Reading) and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to our statistical models as a proxy for confounding genetic effects. StimQ-Reading positively correlated with FA in left AF and to maternal education, but did not mediate the relationship between them. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering HLLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity.

To uncover sources of variation in bilingual and monolingual brain function, the present study used standard analysis and innovative person-specific connectivity models combined with a data-driven grouping algorithm. Children (ages 7-9; N = 52) completed a visuo-spatial attention task while undergoing functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging. Both bilingual and monolingual groups performed similarly, and engaged bilateral frontal and parietal regions. However, bilinguals showed greater brain activity than monolinguals in left frontal and parietal regions. Connectivity models revealed two empirically-derived subgroups. One subgroup was composed of monolinguals and bilinguals who were more English dominant, and showed left frontal-parietal connections. The other was composed of bilinguals who were balanced in their dual-language abilities and showed left frontal lobe connections. The findings inform how individual variation in early language experiences influences children's emerging cortical networks for executive function, and reveal efficacy of data-driven approaches.

Neuroimaging studies measuring the spontaneous activity of the brain are conducted while the participants are not engaged in a particular task or receiving any external stimulation. This approach is particularly useful in developmental populations as brain activity can be measured without the need for infant compliance and the risks of data contamination due to motion artifacts. In this project we sought to i) characterize the intrinsic functional organization of the brain in 4-month-old infants and ii) investigate whether bilingualism, as a specific environmental factor, could lead to adaptations on functional brain network development at this early age. Measures of spontaneous hemodynamic activity were acquired in 4-month-old infants (n = 104) during natural sleep using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Emphasis was placed on acquiring high-quality data that could lead to reproducible results and serve as a valuable resource for researchers investigating the developing functional connectome.

	abstract = {A bilingual environment is associated with changes in the brain's structure and function. Some suggest that bilingualism also improves higher-cognitive functions in infants as young as 6-months, yet whether this effect is associated with changes in the infant brain remains unknown. In the present study, we measured brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy in monolingual- and bilingual-raised 6- and 10-month-old infants. Infants completed an orienting attention task, in which a cue was presented prior to an object appearing on the same (Valid) or opposite (Invalid) side of a display. Task performance did not differ between the groups but neural activity did. At 6-months, both groups showed greater activity for Valid ({\textgreater} Invalid) trials in frontal regions (left hemisphere for bilinguals, right hemisphere for monolinguals). At 10-months, bilinguals showed greater activity for Invalid ({\textgreater} Valid) trials in bilateral frontal regions, while monolinguals showed greater brain activity for Valid ({\textgreater} Invalid) trials in left frontal regions. Bilinguals' brain activity trended with their parents' reporting of dual-language mixing when speaking to their child. These findings are the first to indicate how early (dual) language experience can alter the cortical organization underlying broader, non-linguistic cognitive functions during the first year of life.

In this study, we analyzed data of over 1,000 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine whether monolinguals and multilinguals differ in executive function, functional brain connectivity, and brain-behavior associations. We observed significantly better performance from multilingual children than monolinguals in working-memory tasks. In one finding, we were able to classify multilinguals from monolinguals using only their whole-brain functional connectome at rest and during an emotional n-back task. Compared to monolinguals, the multilingual group had different functional connectivity mainly in the occipital lobe and subcortical areas during the emotional n-back task and in the occipital lobe and prefrontal cortex at rest. In contrast, we did not find any differences in behavioral performance and functional connectivity when performing a stop-signal task. As a second finding, we investigated the degree to which behavior is reflected in the brain by implementing a connectome-based behavior prediction approach. The multilingual group showed a significant correlation between observed and connectome-predicted individual working-memory performance scores, while the monolingual group did not show any correlations. Overall, our observations suggest that multilingualism enhances executive function and reliably modulates the corresponding brain functional connectome, distinguishing multilinguals from monolinguals even at the developmental stage.},

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is a useful source of data for evaluating this claim during childhood, as it involves data from a large sample of American children. Using the baseline ABCD Study data collected at ages nine and ten, the goal of this study was to identify differences in cortical thickness between bilinguals and monolinguals and to evaluate how variability in English vocabulary and English use within bilinguals might explain these group differences. We identified bilingual participants as children who spoke a non-English language and were exposed to the non-English language at home. We then identified a matched sample of English monolingual participants based on age, sex, pubertal status, parent education, household income, non-verbal IQ, and handedness. Bilinguals had thinner cortex than monolinguals in widespread cortical regions. Within bilinguals, more English use was associated with greater frontal and parietal cortical thickness; greater English vocabulary was associated with greater frontal and temporal cortical thickness. These findings replicate and extend previous research with bilingual children and highlight unexplained cortical thickness differences between bilinguals and monolinguals. Copyright Â© 2021.

	abstract = {Deficits have been documented in visuo-orthographic processing as well as phonological retrieval/manipulation during visual word reading in individuals with reading disability (RD); however, the relationship between these deficits remains unclear. Previously, we found that during word reading, visuo-orthographic deficit appears to be a neural signature of RD, but deficits in phonological retrieval/manipulation appears to be a consequence of being RD (Cao et al., 2020). Therefore, in the current study, we directly tested the hypothesis that during visual word reading, deficit in phonological retrieval/manipulation may result from weakened input from visuo-orthographic regions, and that this relationship tends to be universal across languages. We conducted a dynamic causal modelling analysis of fMRI data from Chinese-English bilingual children (9-11 years, N = 78) with or without RD during a visual word rhyming judgment task. We found a weaker connection from the left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) to the left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) in children with RD and reading controls than the connection found in age controls for both Chinese and English. This finding suggests that the phonological deficit at the dIFG may result from weak input from the visuo-orthographic region and this connection appears to be responsive to reading level rather than RD, because the reading-control children were similar to children with RD. We also found that the left ITG was selectively connected with language-specific regions (i.e., the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) for Chinese and the left ventral inferior frontal gyrus (vIFG) for English) depending on the language being processed; however, this language selectivity was reduced in children with RD, suggesting that decreased language specialization is associated with RD. Using a double control design, our study suggests that during reading, the visuo-orthographic deficit of RD constrains the development of the connection from orthography to phonology and to other language-specific processing due to distorted quantity and quality of reading.

	abstract = {Word learning is a significant milestone in language acquisition. The second year of life marks a period of dramatic advances in infants' expressive and receptive word-processing abilities. Studies show that in adulthood, language processing is left-hemisphere dominant. However, adults learning a second language activate right-hemisphere brain functions. In infancy, acquisition of a first language involves recruitment of bilateral brain networks, and strong left-hemisphere dominance emerges by the third year. In the current study we focus on 14-month-old infants in the earliest stages of word learning using infant magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imagining to characterize neural activity in response to familiar and unfamiliar words. Specifically, we examine the relationship between right-hemisphere brain responses and prospective measures of vocabulary growth. As expected, MEG source modeling revealed a broadly distributed network in frontal, temporal and parietal cortex that distinguished word classes between 150-900 ms after word onset. Importantly, brain activity in the right frontal cortex in response to familiar words was highly correlated with vocabulary growth at 18, 21, 24, and 27 months. Specifically, higher activation to familiar words in the 150-300 ms interval was associated with faster vocabulary growth, reflecting processing efficiency, whereas higher activation to familiar words in the 600-900 ms interval was associated with slower vocabulary growth, reflecting cognitive effort. These findings inform research and theory on the involvement of right frontal cortex in specific cognitive processes and individual differences related to attention that may play an important role in the development of left-lateralized word processing.

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility enables appropriate responses to a changing environment and is associated with positive life outcomes. Adolescence, with its increased focus on transitioning to independent living, presents particular challenges for youths with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who often struggle to behave in a flexible way when faced with challenges. This review focuses on brain mechanisms underlying the development of flexible cognition during adolescence and how these neural systems are affected in ASD. Neuroimaging studies of task switching and set-shifting provide evidence for atypical lateral frontoparietal and midcingulo-insular network activation during cognitive flexibility task performance in individuals with ASD. Recent work also examines how intrinsic brain network dynamics support flexible cognition. These dynamic functional connectivity studies provide evidence for alterations in the number of transitions between brain states, as well as hypervariability of functional connections in adolescents with ASD. Future directions for the field include addressing issues related to measurement of cognitive flexibility using a combination of metrics with ecological and construct validity. Heterogeneity of executive function ability in ASD must also be parsed to determine which individuals will benefit most from targeted training to improve flexibility. The influence of pubertal hormones on brain network development and cognitive maturation in adolescents with ASD is another area requiring further exploration. Finally, the intriguing possibility that bilingualism might be associated with preserved cognitive flexibility in ASD should be further examined. Addressing these open questions will be critical for future translational neuroscience investigations of cognitive and behavioral flexibility in adolescents with ASD.

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0851-20.2020},
	abstract = {Functional specialization and plasticity are fundamental organizing principles of the brain. Since the mid-1800s, certain cognitive functions have been known to be lateralized, but the provenance and flexibility of hemispheric specialization remain open questions. Language is a uniquely human phenomenon that requires a delicate balance between neural specialization and plasticity, and language learning offers the perfect window to study these principles in the human brain. In the current study, we conducted two separate functional MRI experiments with language learners (male and female), one cross-sectional and one longitudinal, involving distinct populations and languages, and examined hemispheric lateralization and learning-dependent plasticity of the following three language systems: reading, speech comprehension, and verbal production. A multipronged analytic approach revealed a highly consistent pattern of results across the two experiments, showing (1) that in both native and non-native languages, while language production was left lateralized, lateralization for language comprehension was highly variable across individuals; and (2) that with increasing non-native language proficiency, reading and speech comprehension displayed substantial changes in hemispheric dominance, with languages tending to lateralize to opposite hemispheres, while production showed negligible change and remained left lateralized. These convergent results shed light on the long-standing debate of neural organization of language by establishing robust principles of lateralization and plasticity of the main language systems. Findings further suggest involvement of the sensorimotor systems in language lateralization and its plasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The human brain exhibits a remarkable ability to support a vast variety of languages that may be acquired at different points in the life span. Language is a complex construct involving linguistic as well as visual, auditory, and motor processes. Using functional MRI, we examined hemispheric specialization and learning-dependent plasticity of three language systems-reading, speech comprehension, and verbal production-in cross-sectional and longitudinal experiments in language learners. A multipronged analytic approach revealed converging evidence for striking differences in hemispheric specialization and plasticity among the language systems. The results have major theoretical and practical implications for our understanding of fundamental principles of neural organization of language, language testing and recovery in patients, and language learning in healthy populations.

	abstract = {Although researchers generally agree that a certain set of brain areas underlie bilingual language processing, there is discrepancy regarding what effect timing of language acquisition has on these regions. We aimed to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of age of acquisition (AoA), which has been examined previously, but with inconsistent results, likely influenced by methodological differences across studies. We analyzed gray matter density, volume, and thickness using whole-brain linear models in 334 bilinguals and monolinguals. Neuroanatomical correlates of AoA differed depending on gray matter metric. Relative to early bilinguals, late bilinguals had thicker cortex in language processing and cognitive control regions, and greater density in multiple frontal areas and the right middle temporal and supramarginal gyri. Early bilinguals had greater volume than late bilinguals in the left middle temporal gyrus. Overall, volume was the least sensitive to AoA-related differences. Multiple regions not classically implicated in dual-language processing were also found, which highlights the important role of whole-brain analyses in neuroscience. This is the first study to investigate AoA and gray matter thickness, volume, and density all in the same sample. We conclude that cognitive models of bilingualism should consider the roles of development and neuroanatomical metric in driving our understanding of bilingual and monolingual language organization.

	abstract = {The potential effects of bilingualism on executive control (EC) have been heavily debated. One possible source of discrepancy in the evidence may be that bilingualism tends to be treated as a monolithic category distinct from monolingualism. We address this possibility by examining the effects of different bilingual language experiences on brain activity related to EC performance. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while they performed a Flanker task. Behavioral data showed robust Flanker effects, not modulated by language experiences across participants. However, differences in duration of bilingual experience and extent of active language use predicted activation in distinct brain regions indicating differences in neural recruitment across conditions. This approach highlights the need to consider specific bilingual language experiences in assessing neurocognitive effects. It further underscores the utility and complementarity of neuroimaging evidence in this general line of research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the variability reported in the literature.

	abstract = {Individuals with left temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have a higher rate of atypical (i.e., bilateral or right hemisphere) language lateralization compared to healthy controls. In addition, bilinguals have been observed to have a less left-lateralized pattern of language representation. We examined the combined influence of bilingual language experience and side of seizure focus on language lateralization profiles in TLE to determine whether bilingualism promotes re-organization of language networks. Seventy-two monolingual speakers of English (21 left TLE; LTLE, 22 right TLE; RTLE, 29 age-matched healthy controls; HC) and 24 English-dominant bilinguals (6 LTLE, 7 RTLE, 11 HC) completed a lexical-semantic functional MRI task and standardized measures of language in English. Language lateralization was determined using laterality indices based on activations in left vs right homologous perisylvian regions-of-interest (ROIs). In a fronto-temporal ROI, LTLE showed the expected pattern of weaker left language lateralization relative to HC, and monolinguals showed a trend of weaker left language lateralization relative to bilinguals. Importantly, these effects were qualified by a significant group by language status interaction, revealing that bilinguals with LTLE had greater rightward language lateralization relative to monolingual LTLE, with a large effect size particularly in the lateral temporal region. Rightward language lateralization was associated with better language scores in bilingual LTLE. These preliminary findings suggest a combined effect of bilingual language experience and a left hemisphere neurologic insult, which may together increase the likelihood of language re-organization to the right hemisphere. Our data underscore the need to consider bilingualism as an important factor contributing to language laterality in patients with TLE. Bilingualism may be neuroprotective pre-surgically and may mitigate post-surgical language decline following left anterior temporal lobectomy, which will be important to test in larger samples.Copyright Â© 2022},

	abstract = {Background: Effective family-school partnerships can improve outcomes for autistic students. Yet, we know little about what effective partnerships look like for parents of autistic children from different cultural backgrounds, especially in an Australian context. Here, we provide insight into the first-hand experiences of Vietnamese parents living in Australia as they navigated education for their autistic children. Method(s): Using participatory methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 Vietnamese parents of autistic children (3 - 18 years) attending Australian kindergarten/schools to understand their experiences of parent-teacher interactions. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified three key themes and associated subthemes. Result(s): Parent priorities were caregiving and their children's education. They were clearly respectful of, and deferential towards, teachers and were also concerned about the potential repercussions of advocating for their children. Parents expressed gratitude for what Australia afforded them, often feeling undeserving of additional supports. Not being proficient in English was challenging, especially during periods of pandemic-related remote learning. Stigma and discrimination were commonly experienced, especially towards mothers. Despite challenges, parents fought for what they felt was best for their children, but this advocacy took its toll with stress, exhaustion and isolation frequently described. Culturally-specific services were a key source of assistance. Conclusion(s): This work has implications for how teachers and schools can foster successful relationships with Vietnamese parents of autistic children. Recommendations for schools include supporting families' language preferences, explicitly scaffolding parent advocacy training as well as student self-advocacy strategies and ensuring that the wellbeing of both children and parents is prioritised by schools.Copyright Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Health promoters self-identify as being of Mayan Indian ethnicity. Most are bilingual, speaking Spanish and one of four indigenous Mayan languages native to Chiapas. They volunteer 11 h each week to conduct clinical and public health work in their communities. Over half (53\%) work with a botiquin, a medicine cabinet stocked with essential medicines. Fifty-three percent identify TB as a major problem affecting the health of their communities, with one-fifth (21\%) of promoters reporting experience caring for patients with known or suspected TB and 29\% having attended to patients with hemoptysis. One-third of health promoters have access to antibiotics (32\%) and one-half have experience with their administration; 55\% complement their biomedical treatments with traditional Mayan medicinal plant therapies in caring for their patients. We describe how health promoters employ both traditional and allopathic medicine to treat the symptoms and diseases they encounter most frequently which include fever, diarrhea, and parasitic infections.

While little is known about LDLs' perceptions of their own vulnerability at the workplace, less is known about the strategies they adopt to confront these risks. The purpose of this qualitative study was to assess LDLs' perceptions of their workplace dangers and to document the strategies they adopt and endorse to confront them. Guided by a participatory research approach, four focus groups stratified by age were conducted with 34 LDLs in Houston, Texas. Main focus group themes were identified using a combination of qualitative analysis methods involving a thematic analysis conducted by the interview team, LDL advisors, and bilingual Latino researchers. All participants were Latino males (mean age = 40), the majority reported having completed sixth grade or less (64.2\%) and having lived in the United States for an average of 12.7 years. We described three categories of strategies to reduce risk for workplace injury generated by local LDLs (practical knowledge and job experience, interpersonal, and personal). These strategies should be explored and encouraged to assist in planning risk-reduction programs, presented in the voice and language of Latino "inside experts" with firsthand experience. The findings of the focus group suggest that LDLs already possess a broad repertoire of strategies to cope with risks at work that can be incorporated in safety programs for LDLs and other immigrant Latino workers.},

	doi = {10.1093/heapro/daac132},
	abstract = {To investigate a health promotion strategy to improve oral health among former refugees in New Zealand. Former refugees were recruited (n = 63) and answered a questionnaire about their oral home care, smoking, sugar consumption and use of dental services. Participants then joined either focus group sessions to co-design oral health educational material (n = 39) or to be dentally examined for oral hygiene, periodontal health, gingivitis and dental caries and receive motivational instructions to improve their oral health habits (n = 20). Health messages using dual-language leaflets (covering oral home care, smoking, diet and access to services) were subsequently individually delivered monthly to all participants via a mobile phone application. After 6 months, follow-up questionnaires were sent to all participants and those who had been dentally examined were re-examined. Half of those who did not brush twice daily at baseline (54.1\%) had increased brushing to at least twice daily by follow-up; 76.9\% of those who consumed sugary drinks at least twice daily, reduced their sugar intake. No smokers quit smoking, however, 52.4\% reported reducing the number of cigarettes or engaging in smoking cessation activities. Among those who had been dentally examined, plaque scores, gingivitis and periodontal pocketing all decreased significantly. Culturally and linguistically tailored oral health promotion interventions led to improved oral health behaviours for this group of former refugees over a 6 months follow-up period. We expect this to not only improve the oral health quality of life for this population, but also reduce the burden on the health system.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed to identify community assets from the perspective of Latinx immigrant families with youth with disabilities. Latinx immigrant families (n=21) participated in the mapping, followed by a reflection session and an open forum (n=30). The findings revealed that families identified faith-based organizations and social service agencies as some of the main assets in their communities, while they identified mental health services as the most needed. The results also showed that participants preferred to utilize services and resources that are within walking distance of their homes, provide safe spaces, treat them well, offer bilingual services, do not require documentation, and are affordable. This study has important implications for community scholars and practitioners interested in implementing asset-based methodologies that focus on participants as experts of their own realities and agents of change and that promote advocacy and empowerment actions.Copyright Â© 2021 Society for Community Research and Action.},

Through youth participatory action research (yPAR), this study qualitatively examined how a class of Emerging Bilingual (EB) students aimed to promote more inclusive learning environments by designing, implementing, and evaluating a school-wide program. Here, we consider how the students experienced growth in their civic development as well as how they contended with resistances encountered during the project. Method(s): The current study took place at amajority I-O, northeastern high school and was led by an EB class (n = 20) and its teacher. Participants were as follows: on average 16.5 years; 60\% female; and 65\% Latinx, 30\%Black, and 5\% mixed-race (Black-Latino).Multiple data sources documenting the students' experiences were collected (including weekly student reflections and ethnographic field notes) and then thematically analyzed using open coding. Result(s): Participating students demonstrated civic development as evidenced through: growing confidence that the program could generate positive change; enhanced sense of connection toward their classmates; and increased commitment to future civic engagement. Nonetheless, some participants demonstrated initial trepidation in both disclosing their migration stories as well as the potential efficacy of engaging in the project. Furthermore, otherswere disappointed by the disinterest displayed by some of their peers and teachers. Conclusion(s): Collaborative research can support I-O youths' civic development, though, the resistances encountered and engendered illuminate possible challenges to ensure its benefits.Copyright Â© 2021.

	abstract = {Obesity and being overweight are major public health concerns that health coaching can assist people to manage through encouraging self-management and behaviour change. The Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service (GHS) is a telephone health coaching service in Australia that has effectively improved the health of the general population but has had less participation of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) populations. The Chinese population is the largest migrant group in Australia with increased risk of diabetes but had reduced access to the GHS program due to communication barriers. The GHS developed a pilot program for Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese-speaking) communities using bilingual coaches and translated material to address these barriers. Qualitative research was undertaken with Chinese stakeholders (14 interviews) and 11 program participants from the group which had completed the program (2 focus groups in Mandarin and Cantonese) to understand their experiences and the success of promotional activities. This research does not contain the experiences of the people that withdrew from the program. The bilingual program was culturally and linguistically appropriate and addressed risk factors for chronic conditions. Participants formed positive relationships with bilingual coaches who they preferred to interpreters. They felt the program promoted healthy eating, weight and physical activity. Although Chinese stakeholders had concerns about participants' ability to goal set, participants said they met their health goals and were committed to the GHS program. Strategies to enhance the program included promoting the bilingual GHS to the communities and stakeholders. Factors to consider beyond language in adapting the program to the Australian Chinese communities include meeting the heterogenous needs of the older population, ensuring community engagement and addressing cultural beliefs and practices.Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2021.

This increased diversity highlights the need for clinicians to be educated early in their careers about best practices to serve patients and clients from diverse backgrounds. In this clinical focus article, the authors present the development, implementation, and preliminary perceptions of a culturally responsive clinical experience for speech-language pathology graduate students designed to engage them early in their learning career. METHOD(S): The pilot program was based on pillars of experiential learning and community engagement. Graduate students attended trainings aligned with a model of culturally relevant care to prepare them to conduct speech and language screenings and small group language enrichment in English and Spanish. RESULT(S): Preliminary analyses of student reflections indicated themes of positive perceptions about the experience and provided preliminary support for students learning about working with culturally and linguistically diverse populations in an early, intentional, and focused experience. CONCLUSION(S): Early personnel preparation to culturally responsive care is crucial to meet the needs of future caseloads. Further research into the effectiveness of this kind of program is necessary to identify which variables may have the most impact on a student's cultural sensitivity, awareness, knowledge, and skills.},

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey administered by postal mail and bilingual telephone interviewers. METHOD(S): Patients were randomly selected within strata by race, ethnicity, and language proficiency. A total of 224 patients (response rate: 63.5\%) who had recently experienced a hospital stay completed the survey. RESULT(S): Overall, 1 in 4 patients were alone at discharge. More than half of patients with limited English proficiency reported lack of access to medical interpreters and translated materials. We noted significant differences by race, ethnicity, and language in technology access and in patient-reported worries in the posthospital period. Hispanic or Latino patients and patients with limited English proficiency were less likely to report access to a computer and less likely to access the Patient Gateway portal. Black or African American patients were also less likely to use the Patient Gateway portal. Asian patients were more likely to be worried about getting home health services. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings highlight the enhanced difficulties that diverse patients may experience when transitioning from hospital to community-based settings. When considering how to best address the complex needs of diverse populations, interventions must be sensitive to the presence or absence of others, potential digital divides, and medical interpretation.Copyright Â© 2021 Ascend Media.

Objective To explore community pharmacists' experiences serving culturally and linguistically diverse patients who have low English proficiency. Setting Community pharmacists in Australia. Method Focus group discussions with practising community pharmacists were conducted. Participants were recruited from metropolitan Sydney. Discussion centred around their current experiences and practice changes needed to enhance the provision of culturally competent pharmaceutical care. Thematic analysis using the constant comparison method within a grounded theory approach was performed on the data collected. Main outcome measure Participants' experiences in providing culturally competent care to culturally and linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency. Results Thirty community pharmacists participated in six focus group discussions. Inadequate provision of culturally competent care was found to be primarily due to the issue of language incongruence between pharmacist and patient. Participants proposed various means with which such care may be provided to ensure patient safety. Conclusion Pharmacist participants expressed being inadequately equipped to provide culturally competent care in the community setting and identified potential means by which such care may be delivered. Addressing identified barriers that hinder community pharmacists' capacity to engage in culturally competent practice can potentially improve provision of pharmaceutical care to culturally and linguistically diverse patients with low English proficiency.Copyright Â© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

OBJECTIVE(S): Develop a culturally-tailored advance care planning (ACP) tool to understand the EOL preferences of this underserved minority group. METHOD(S): Informed by the Cultural Appropriateness Theory, the Chinese American Coalition for Compassionate Care (CACCC) developed Heart to Heart (HTH) Cards using a 3-step approach. First, CACCC created and refined a list of bilingual, culturally relevant EOL issues. Next, CACCC organized the EOL issues into a card deck. Finally, CACCC developed a unique playstyle of the cards-the HTH Cafe. From 2014-2019, CACCC recruited Chinese American volunteers and participants for HTH Cafes. Following each Cafe, participants completed an anonymous survey describing their sociodemographics, top 3 cards, and cafe evaluation. RESULT(S): The 54 HTH Cards were organized into 4 suits (spiritual, physical, financial/legal, and social). Each card displayed a culturally-tailored EOL issue in English and Chinese. Playstyles included one-on-one and group formats (ie. HTH Cafe). CACCC volunteers conducted 316 HTH Cafes for 2,267 Chinese American adults. Most participants were female (61.6\%), between 18-50 years old (56.7\%), lived in California (80.2\%) and born in Asia (74.3\%). The top priority (25.5\%) was "If I'm going to die anyway, I don't want to be kept alive by machines." Participants thought the session was pleasant (99.5\%) and expressed intent to complete advance directives (86.5\%). CONCLUSION(S): HTH Cards represents the first, theory-driven, culturally-tailored ACP tool for Chinese Americans. More research is needed to establish its impact on ACP conversations and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Although many diabetes self-management apps exist, these are not tailored for people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. This study aimed to explore GP perceptions of how diabetes app features could help GPs better support their patients from CALD backgrounds. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews with GPs in Western Sydney explored attitudes towards a proposed app's suitability for CALD patients. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using Framework Analysis. Theme 1 explored the implications of perceptions that patients' health literacy is dependent on the language used. Theme 2 explored the influence of messaging from sources that share the patient's language and culture (including misinformation from community sources). Theme 3 described the suitability of the app platform for CALD patients, and its potential challenges in this group. GPs perceived that a diabetes app could be useful for providing support to patients from CALD backgrounds. Findings suggest app features should be optimised to address existing challenges that GPs face and carefully consider strategies for recruiting CALD patients. It is important that GPs feel comfortable promoting an app to their CALD patients to help increase participation rates by people in the CALD community.Copyright Â© 2020 La Trobe University.},

	doi = {10.1111/dar.12895},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Increasing treatment uptake among people who inject drugs (PWID) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is integral to eliminating viral hepatitis. This study explored the role of community-based outreach in engaging and retaining Australian PWID in the testing component of the HCV care cascade. DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 PWID, including new initiates to injecting and those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, who acquired HCV infection while enrolled in a community-based prospective observational study of hepatitis C vaccine preparedness in Sydney. Participants were interviewed at diagnosis and 12 months later. Transcripts were thematically analysed using constant comparative techniques. RESULT(S): Community-based outreach was effective in engaging newly infected participants in HCV monitoring and decision-making about seeking interferon-based treatment. Key factors in the acceptability of outreach were privacy and discretion, and opportunities to build trust with non-judgmental staff. Retaining participants in the HCV cascade of care required more than a one-off session of post-test counselling. Ongoing discussions with staff enabled paced and tailored delivery of information about HCV prevention, testing and treatment. Increased understanding of the role of HCV ribonucleic acid viremia in determining the need for treatment, and access to this testing, was pivotal in making HCV monitoring salient for participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION(S): Outreach is an effective strategy for engaging new initiates to injecting and CALD PWID in HCV testing and decision-making about treatment. Findings highlight the need to increase availability and access to HCV ribonucleic acid testing for PWID.Copyright Â© 2019 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Despite substantial investments in research, asthma continues to pose a significant health burden for Hispanics in the US. In NYC, Hispanics have higher asthma prevalence than non-Hispanics (10.9\% vs. 7.4\%), and more than double the rate of ER visits (33.8\% vs.12.8\%). Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) works with community members to define research questions and collaborate on the conduct of the research in order to derive more pertinent research questions with results that may be more readily adopted. We describe the results of collaboration with a community outreach organization to understand Hispanic asthma research needs and misconceptions, and the resulting intervention to improve asthma knowledge. Method(s): Partnering with the community outreach organization, El Poder de Decidir, we conducted 12 Hispanic community asthma meetings to identify research priorities. This was augmented by asthma education literature, and discussions with organizations experienced with Hispanic asthma outreach. Six Hispanic Asthma Community Leaders (ACLs) were trained using educational modules highlighting misconceptions about asthma. Modules were summarized in a brief asthma education card. At the completion of training, ACLs were also asked to react to 4 hypothetical asthma patient scenarios to test their knowledge. ACLs then assembled members from their community for teaching using the brief asthma education card, and observed by members from El Poder de Decidir and a bilingual pulmonologist. Participants completed preand post- asthma knowledge surveys, and results were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test. Result(s): The development of the intervention including the community workshops, education modules and brief asthma education card for ACLs was collaboratively developed over two years. The 6 ACLs were trained over the course of 3 months and were then observed as they taught a total of 104 participants. Among all participants, the mean knowledge score increased from 0.56 (sd 0.18) to 0.85 (sd 0.13) pre- and post- teaching by ACLs (0.282 (95\%CI 0.25-0.31) t(103)=17.62); p=0.0001). At baseline the most commonly missed questions were about asthma symptoms and triggers, and that daily need to use asthma indicated the need for controller medication. Conclusion(s): We have successfully developed and tested an asthma education intervention for the Hispanic community which includes tailored education materials to build on identified misconceptions, and Hispanic ACLs to teach to their own community members. Further studies are warranted to determine whether these results persist among a larger group, what the comparative effectiveness is versus other education-based interventions and the longer term health benefits.},

The purpose of this study was to conduct a community needs assessment and inform the development and implementation of culturally appropriate primary prevention strategies for community-based interventions, specifically related to medication disposal practices. Three data collection techniques were utilized: key informant interviews (n=4), intercept surveys (n=71), and focus group discussions (n=8; 61 participants). To accommodate linguistically diverse subpopulations, surveys and focus groups were available in English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, and Hindi. Participants were overwhelmingly female (survey: 70\%/FGD: 84\%), ethnic minorities (survey: 61\%/FGD: 66\%), and, on average, middle-aged [survey: 52 years (SD: 19)/FGD: 54 (15)]. Approximately one in three survey respondents (30\%) had heard of drug-take back events, and one in ten (10\%) had participated. Non-English speakers were less likely to both perceive a community problem with prescription drugs (beta=-.35; p{\textless}.001) and be aware of take-back opportunities (beta=-.23; p=.038). Focus group participants expressed confusion about appropriate medication disposal methods, identifying potential sources of conflicting information. Recent media coverage and political events have heightened stigma towards non-English speaking and non-native peoples, increasing their fear of law enforcement and other perceived threats. To encourage community engagement in take-back events, we identified multiple ways, such as multilingual materials and marketing campaigns, which may help marginalized suburban subpopulations feel less threatened and more included in prescription drug misuse prevention activities.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess factors associated with HPV vaccine-related awareness and knowledge among caregivers of adolescents from five ethnic community groups in Utah. Design(s): For this community-based participatory research study, we surveyed N=228 caregivers of teens aged 11-17 years from African American, African refugee, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community groups in Utah about their HPV vaccine awareness and knowledge. Result(s): Participants exhibited high awareness of cervical cancer (71.05\%), moderate awareness of HPV (53.95\%), and low awareness of the HPV vaccine (46.49\%). HPV vaccine-related knowledge was mostly worse, with fewer than half the participants reporting knowing that HPV can cause cervical cancer (46.93\%), that most people are infected with HPV at some point in their lives (28.95\%), that HPV is asymptomatic in females (36.40\%) and males (37.28\%), that the HPV vaccine is recommended for adolescent females (41.67\%) and males (36.40\%), and that the HPV vaccine requires more than one dose (27.19\%). HPV vaccine-related awareness and knowledge were significantly associated with race/ethnicity, educational attainment, income, occupation, birthplace, parents' birthplace, English usage, health insurance coverage, type of health insurance, and child having a primary care provider (all p{\textless}0.05). HPV vaccine-related knowledge (p{\textless}0.05) and awareness (p{\textless}0.05) of caregivers were associated with a child in the household receiving the HPV vaccine. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate a need to develop educational interventions in collaboration with diverse communities in Utah. We underscore the importance of promoting knowledge about the existence of the HPV vaccine, as well as deeper HPV vaccine-related issues (e.g. HPV risks, treatment, and recommendations).},

Peer programs have been effective in HIV outreach and prevention but effectiveness of such programs for retention in care and viral suppression is understudied. Subjects (n = 348) were randomized in equal allocation to a peer navigation and education intervention versus standard clinical care at three urban clinics in the United States. The intervention group received seven structured interventions plus weekly contact to address medical and social needs. Primary outcomes included time-to-first 4-month gap in HIV care and viral suppression up to 12 months of follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between groups on 4-month gap in HIV primary care, but subgroup analysis showed a suggestive effect of the peer intervention in reducing gaps in care among stably housed subjects. Fully compliant subjects in the peer intervention experienced significantly fewer 4-month gaps in HIV primary care (p {\textless} 0.0001). Those in the peer group who had more clinical face-to-face encounters in the first 3 months were also significantly more likely to have better retention in care (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences between any study subgroups in viral suppression at 12 months. Peer interventions may improve retention in primary care among subgroups of people living with HIV from racial/ethnic minority communities, although such improved retention may not increase viral load suppression. Attending and completing structured educational sessions along with early, intensive contact with peers could improve retention in HIV primary care for patients. Future peer programs should consider training on housing referral systems to help increase retention for patients who are not stably housed. clinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT01616940.},

RESULT(S): (a) The value of respect among Hispanic/Latino families is a risk factor for unplanned teen pregnancy. (b) Contextual aspects (i.e. local ideology, Mexican media, underfunded schools, permissive law enforcement in bars, lack of bilingual providers) place Hispanic/Latina female adolescents at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy. (c) Gender roles perpetuate inequality and deepen Hispanic/Latina females' vulnerability to unplanned pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE(S): To describe 1) the formation of Insure Detroit, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership aimed at addressing health insurance and Affordable Care Act (ACA) literacy challenges in economically disadvantaged areas, 2) the development of Insuring Good Health, a novel, multimedia, health information technology-focused intervention to address the health aims of the partnership, and 3) the evaluation plan for the intervention. METHOD(S): Insure Detroit, a partnership between researchers and community-based organizations, was established. Principles of CBPR were followed closely in the conduct of this project. The Insure Detroit partnership developed the intervention and evaluation plan through an iterative process. The Insuring Good Health intervention is multilingual and composed of a responsive website. It includes nine short, animated videos informed by storytelling techniques that communicate key learning points pertaining to health insurance navigation and use. LESSONS LEARNED: Lessons learned included narrowing learning points for the intervention, balancing the volume of work to comply with the study timeline, and balancing the political climate with the development of the intervention. CONCLUSION(S): The Insure Detroit partnership demonstrates that a CBPR approach can develop media-based health communications to address health insurance literacy. Our experiences highlight that CBPR principles that encourage shared decision making and co-learning can result in high-quality, innovative interventions that have the potential to resonate well with communities of color.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Milwaukee, a city characterized by high rates of racial segregation and a growing immigrant population, has large race-based breast cancer survival disparities. To address these disparities, breast health education workshops were offered through a community-academic partnership (CAP) to women from various ethnic backgrounds. This paper explores attendance, satisfaction, and rates of screening mammography among workshop attendees. Method(s): Partnerships were formed with community-based organizations, a mobile mammography unit, and the Wisconsin Well Woman Program, a state-supported program providing free mammograms. Multilingual staff provided monthly breast health education workshops at community settings and coordinated transportation. Participants completed surveys that included demographics, prior screening history, barriers to screening, and program evaluation. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and analyze data. Result(s): Over a 24-month period, 493 women-most of whom sought services at partnering organizations that serve primarily immigrants, refugees, and racial minorities-attended breast health workshops, with 374 participants completing surveys (mean age = 45 years). A total of 360 were {\textgreater}= 40 years old. Among these women, 188 (113 insured [60\%], 75 uninsured [40\%]) reported no prior mammogram in the past 2 to 5 years. After attending the workshop, mammogram uptake was 100\% among the insured and 80\% among the uninsured. Satisfaction with the workshops was high; 73\% of attendees rated them highly informative. Conclusion(s): Our CAP offered culturally tailored breast health education and access to screening via a mobile unit that was well attended, highly rated, and increased screening mammography.Copyright Â© 2018 Wisconsin Medical Society.},

Academics from China, Australia and UK developed a Summer School EBM course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) students in China. Method(s): An action research approach was used to evaluate the effects of an international collaborative approach to improve learning and teaching. A systematic analysis of an EBM course conducted in 2015 with (66) students and (16) teacher/assistants was used to inform the 2016 course design. Before and after implementation of the 2016 course, (10) teacher/assistant and (20) student pre-/post-course survey responses were recorded to measure attitudes, knowledge and intention to apply EBM in TCM practice. Focus groups, teachers' diaries, field notes and survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data. Result(s): Changes made in the 2016 course include changing topic focus, catering for different language abilities and varying the learning format. Students and teachers found the course engaging and relevant. Chinese teachers adopted interactive teaching methods and believed they improved student engagement and learning. Teachers reported teaching EBM to TCM students in English was challenging but benefited from the experience. Students embraced the concepts of EBM and performed beyond their and their teachers' expectations. Conclusion(s): Cross-cultural collaboration in teaching a culturally challenging topic in a foreign language using unfamiliar teaching methods is demanding However, utilisation of an action research model can result in positive student evaluation and change in teacher beliefs and practice through sharing reflections and ideas.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Purpose of study Racial/ethnic health disparities are preventable differences in health outcomes between different races/ethnicities that are closely linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantages. Geography continues to be a predictor of health disparities where infant mortality and chronic health outcomes appear to be intensified in high poverty tract areas in which African Americans and Latinos tend to live, compared to poor non-Hispanic whites. Watts is perpetually constructed as an under-resourced neighbourhood of Los Angeles where residents experience the poorest health. Resources and community health fairs have been identified as effective approaches to reach residents, ensuring health screenings, resource sharing, and gathering data. The primary objective of this study was to provide basic screenings and resources, while assess effectiveness of the fair and gather residents' healthrelated seeking behaviours to identify community-driven strategies to improve overall health. Methods used Using community based participatory research, this study developed and administered a bilingual survey to capture residents' perspectives on the effectiveness of the fair, personal health seeking behaviours, and suggestions to improve health and wellbeing in the community. The surveys were deidentified and coded for frequency analysis of responses using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Summary of results Of the 200 attendees, 107 completed the survey: 71 Latinos, 28 African Americans, 73 Females, 26 Males, 31 between the ages of 36-45, and 51 with a household income under \$15 000. Respondents determined their primary reason for attending was health screenings and identified transportation as a barrier to making their doctor's appointment. The park and library were resources accessed the most, and community-driven recommendations included nutritional education and more health fairs. Conclusions Resources and health fairs in low-income communities serve as immediate approaches for low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. However, health fairs are not able to follow-up with most participants and may be inconsistent. Therefore, large-scale interventions should address limitations to ensure wellbeing in these areas.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore multilevel factors affecting older Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviours. BACKGROUND: Although studies have documented significant issues related to healthcare access and utilisation issues among older immigrants, a noted limitation of current research is its failure to explore multiple factors related to their health-seeking behaviours. DESIGN: A qualitative study using interview data from two previous studies. METHOD(S): We performed a qualitative analysis of focus groups and individual interviews using inductive coding methods. The socioecological model provided a useful framework to guide this study. The sample included 17 community-dwelling older Korean immigrants aged {\textgreater}=65 years living in the metropolitan area of Seattle, WA, USA. RESULT(S): Findings revealed various factors at the individual (e.g., perception of health and illness, mistrust, cultural values and norms, length of residency in the United States, language barriers and ageing experiences), interpersonal (e.g., peers, family and primary care physicians), community (e.g., ethnic community centres and organisations, home care helpers and interpretation services) and policy (e.g., lack of affordability and health benefits coverage) levels. Each of these factors played a role as either a barrier to or facilitator of older Korean immigrants' health-seeking behaviours. Several factors, such as language barriers and lack of available information, were intertwined. CONCLUSION(S): Findings indicate the importance of considering four major areas when designing culturally appropriate, community-based interventions for older immigrants. Also, utilising peers or trusted human resources in the community is critical to the design and implementation of health promotion interventions for older immigrants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Examining intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and policy level factors that affect older immigrants' health-seeking behaviours informs the design of community-based health promotion interventions for older immigrants.Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Minorities and older adults are particularly vulnerable to receiving suboptimal healthcare. Method(s): In collaboration with community organizations and a Federal government grant through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Geriatric Resource Interprofessional Program (GRIP) was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). It spearheaded an educational initiative on cognitive dysfunction targeting minority communities in Queens County. Four sessions were conducted at community centers. An additional session was conducted to address the needs of caregivers of older adults with dementias. Consecutive interpretation of the lectures was performed to the predominant language of the group. Two sessions discussing the assessment and management of cognitive syndromes in older cancer patients were delivered to clinical staff at regional locations of MSKCC. Result(s): A total of 171 people who spoke 15 different primary languages attended the community sessions. Their median age was 66 (28-99 years) and 65\% were women. 53\% were born in Bangladesh, the rest in 16 other countries. 34 providers-nurses, case managers, social workers and oncologists attended the two clinical sessions. Their median age was 57.5 (31-73 years). 90\% were female (N=31) and 82\% identified as white (N=28).

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older Chinese Americans have a disproportionately higher rate of undertreated hypertension (HTN) compared to non-Latino Whites, and Asian Americans report weaker patient-provider engagement than desired. As patient activation can be a powerful driver of improved HTN control, we assessed the efficacy of a culturally tailored clinical pharmacist intervention on patient activation among immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. METHOD(S): We conducted a pre-post, prospective intervention with repeated measures in Los Angeles County. We screened and recruited patients from 8 community health centers and private practice clinics between 2015-2016. Eligible patients (age 60+, medically insured, past year visit at study clinic, at least 2 of 3 systolic blood pressure [BP] readings above JNC-8 goal in past year) were invited to a study information session through mailings and telephone calls in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Enrolled participants had 3 visits within 3 months with bilingual study pharmacists, who were trained to elicit HTN explanatory models when providing HTN education and use motivational interviewing (MI) and shared decision-making (SDM) when counseling patients on lifestyle changes and BP medications. Study participants' physicians received a brief summary of each visit and signed pharmacist recommendations for medications or lab orders if in agreement. Participants completed baseline and final surveys before their first and after their last pharmacist visit, including demographic information and the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). We also conducted chart reviews to obtain clinical information. We estimated a sample size of 50 patients would detect a clinically significant 3 to 5-point difference in our primary outcome, PAM scores, with 80\% power. We tested for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULT(S): We screened 415 potential participants to enroll 50 immigrant Chinese American seniors who received the intervention. The average age was 71 years, and 23 (47\%) were female. Participants had resided in the U.S. for an average of 30 years, but only 10 (20\%) were comfortable speaking English. Median baseline level of trust in pharmacists was "somewhat" to "strongly trust". The mean baseline PAM score was 58.8 signifying "beginning to take action," with a mean change of -2.04 +/- 13.9 (p = 0.48) at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): While clinical pharmacist HTN interventions have shown success in some settings, our intervention utilizing MI and SDMstrategies was not associated with increases in PAM scores for immigrant Chinese American seniors with uncontrolled HTN. Despite strong project involvement of community partners in these predominantly Asian neighborhoods, eligible seniors frequently declined to enroll. We will continue to work closely with our community partners to identify other team-based care approaches which may be more appealing and successful at increasing patient activation for HTN control in this population.},

	abstract = {DESIGN: A descriptive correlational study was used that employed community partnership and empowerment strategies. One year postintervention, in the summer of 2015, a bilingual, interdisciplinary research team conducted a house-to-house survey with families who received water filters., METHODS: Survey data were gathered from the head of household on family demographics, current family health, water filter usage, and type of flooring in the home. Interviews were conducted in Spanish and in partnership with a village leader. Each family received a food package of household staples for their participation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all responses. Fisher's exact test and odds ratios were used to determine relationships between variables., FINDINGS: Seventy-nine percent (n = 56) of the 71 households that received a water filter in 2014 participated in the study. The majority of families (71.4\%; n = 40) were using the water filters and 16 families (28.6\%) had broken water filters. Of the families with working water filters, 15\% reported diarrhea, while 31\% of families with a broken water filter reported diarrhea. Only 55.4\% of the homes had concrete flooring. More households with dirt flooring and broken water filters reported a current case of diarrhea. A record review of attendees at an outreach clinic in this village noted a decrease in intestinal infections from 2014 (53\%) to 2015 (32\%)., CONCLUSIONS: A trend suggests that water filter usage was both practically and clinically significant in reducing the incidence of diarrheal disease in this sample. Some homes did not have flat surfaces for water filter storage. Housing conditions should be taken into consideration for future diarrheal disease prevention initiatives., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Point-of-use water filters using a community-university partnership can reduce diarrheal disease in rural regions of Guatemala., PURPOSE: Infants and children in developing countries bear the burden of diarrheal disease. Diarrheal disease is linked to unsafe drinking water and can result in serious long-term consequences, such as impaired immune function and brain growth. There is evidence that point-of-use water filtration systems reduce the prevalence of diarrhea in developing countries. In the summer of 2014, following community forums and interactive workshops, water filters were distributed to 71 households in a rural Maya community in Guatemala. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the uptake of tabletop water filtration systems to reduce diarrheal diseases.Copyright Â© 2016 Sigma Theta Tau International.},

	abstract = {Depression frequently negatively affects patient overall self-care and social stress management within United States safety net care systems. Rates of major depression are significantly high among low-income predominantly Hispanic/Latino with chronic illness, such as diabetes and heart disease. The study design of the A Helping Hand to Activate Patient-Centered Depression Care among Low-income Patients (AHH) randomized clinical trial aims to enhance patient depression care receipt and overall bio-psychosocial self-care management. The AHH trial is conducted in collaboration with three Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) safety net clinics that provide Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) care. The study compares AHH intervention (AHH) in which community-based bilingual promotoras provide in-person or telephone patient engagement and intervention aimed to reduce the burden and strain on patients, families, and care providers by assessing, enhancing, and facilitating patient depression and co-morbid illness self-care management skill, and activating patient communication with clinic medical providers versus DHS PCMH team usual care (PCMHUC). AHH independent bilingual recruiters screened 1957 and enrolled 348 predominantly Hispanic/Latino patients, of whom 296 (85\%) had diabetes, 14 (4\%) with heart disease, and 38 (11\%) with both diseases. Recruiters identified depressed patients by baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores of 10 or more, completed baseline assessments, and randomized patients to either AHH or PCMHUC study group. The comprehensive assessments will be repeated at 6 and 12 months by an independent bilingual follow-up interviewer. Baseline and outcome data include mental health assessment and treatment receipt, co-morbid illness self-care, social relationships, and environmental stressor assessments.Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Issue addressed: Recently arrived migrants and refugees from a culturally and linguistically diverse background (CALD) may be particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. Participation in sport is endorsed as a vehicle to ease the resettlement process; however, in Australia, this is often thought as a simple matter of integration into existing sport structures (e.g. clubs). This approach fails to place actual community needs at the centre of sport engagement efforts. Method(s): A consultation framework was established with South Australian CALD community leaders and organisations to scope needs for community-based alternatives to participation in traditional sport (e.g. clubs), co-design a suitable community sport program and pilot it in five communities. Interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted with participants, community representatives, stakeholders and volunteers. Result(s): Regular, free soccer activities engaged 263 young people from a great variety of nationalities, including over 50\% refugees, in secondary state school and community-based sites. Conclusion(s): Alternative community sport programs can provide a basic but valuable forum to promote physical activity and associated well being in CALD and refugee communities.So what?: Alternative approaches can extend the health benefits of sport participation to disadvantaged children and youth who are excluded from traditional sport participation opportunities.},

	doi = {10.1177/0194599815593310f},
	abstract = {Objectives: Despite increasing evidence of hearing impairment in older adults being associated with a decline in cognitive and physical function, hearing health care remains complex and expensive for most older adults. Navigating the hearing health care system is challenging for minorities with language and cultural barriers, including older Korean Americans who are predominantly first-generation immigrants. This study aims to develop and test the feasibility of a pilot intervention to provide hearing counseling and affordable amplification devices to older Korean Americans with hearing impairment. Method(s): Our study consisted of 3 stages: (1) development of the intervention through exploratory focus groups, (2) trial of intervention to 10 to 15 older Korean Americans and their communication partners, and (3) qualitative evaluation. Preand postintervention changes were measured in communication, social isolation, depression, quality of life, stigma, and third-party disability. Result(s): We have learned that many older Korean Americans do not seek help for hearing or adopt the use of listening devices due to language and financial barriers along with sociocultural factors related to stigma toward aging and disability. We have developed a culturally tailored program that consists of a 1-hour session that teaches how to use an amplification device and communication tips followed by a group practice session. Preliminary implementation has demonstrated positive responses from the participants. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to report a hearing health care model using a community outreach program in a population of Korean American older adults. A community-based hearing health intervention can be an effective way to address poor access to hearing health care among minority older adults.},

	abstract = {In this article, we analyze qualitative data from a purposeful sample of limited English proficiency (LEP) asthma health caregivers. We used ethnically concordant, semistructured, in-depth Spanish-language interviews and a follow-up focus group to explore issues related to communication during pediatric asthma encounters in medical settings. Inductive coding of Spanish transcripts by a bilingual research team was performed until thematic saturation was reached. Several key findings emerged. LEP caregivers encountered significant asthma burdens related to emotional stress, observed physical changes, and communication barriers. Language-discordant communication and the use of ad hoc interpreters were common. This finding is complex, and was influenced by perceptions of interpreter availability, delays in care, feelings of mistrust toward others, and individual emotional responses. Language-concordant education and suitable action plans were valued and desired. We discuss a revealing depiction of the LEP caregiver experience with asthma health communication and recommend areas for further inquiry. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dissemination of trusted disaster information to limited English proficient (LEP) communities may mitigate the negative effects these higher risk communities experience in disasters. For immigrant communities, disaster messages may be perceived with skepticism, and fear of public officials may affect compliance with disaster messages. This study explores whether medical interpreters (MIs) and bilingual school staff (BSS) are already informal information sources for LEP communities, and could their connection to both public service organizations and LEP communities make them ideal efficient, trusted disaster information conduits for LEP communities., DESIGN: The authors conducted a mixed methods study, which included MI individual interviews, Latino community focus groups, an MI employer survey, and school administrator interviews., SETTING: To ensure diversity in the sample, data were collected in both Los Angeles and Seattle., RESULTS: MIs, MI employers, and schools are willing to communicate disaster information to LEP communities. MIs and BSS are connected to and share information with LEP communities. Latino LEP communities are eager for more disaster information and sources., CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that a multipronged approach that includes collaborating with professionals linked to immigrant communities, such as MIs and BSS, could be an effective method of disaster information dissemination. Working with MIs and BSS as part of a wider dissemination strategy would promote a community-based interpersonal flow of information that would contribute to LEP community's trust in the message.},

Studies have rarely examined interethnic differences in the resilience factors for depression in this diverse population. Greater understanding is needed as the number of older Southeast Asians in the United States increases., OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the association between social connectedness and depressive symptoms in Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian elders., METHODS: Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, bilingual/bicultural staff collected demographics, the Lubben Social Network Scale, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Univariate and multivariate regression models were constructed for the full aggregated sample and for each ethnic subgroup., RESULTS: In the full aggregated sample analysis, Southeast Asian elders were at increased risk for depression and had low social connectedness. Marriage and English proficiency were resilience factors, whereas social connectedness did not play a significant role. In disaggregated analyses, high social connectedness, marriage, and younger age were resilience factors for Vietnamese elders. English proficiency was the only significant resilience factor for Laotians, and age at the time of immigration was the only significant resilience factor for Cambodian elders., CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the need for researchers to disaggregate data for ethnic subgroups in the Asian American population. Southeast Asian elders are at increased risk for depression and have low social connectedness. There exist important interethnic differences in resilience factors for geriatric depression, suggesting the need for more studies and interventions that are sensitive to subtle cultural differences among Southeast Asian subgroups.},

With accumulating research evidence suggesting that falls can be prevented through exercise, there is an increased public health effort among organizations serving older adults to translate and disseminate evidence-based programs into the community. Such efforts, however, face additional challenges if they are implemented in communities with older adults from different cultural backgrounds and languages. This paper briefly describes a pilot community-based dissemination project, including the initiation, implementation, process, and outcomes, of an evidence-based fall prevention (Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance formerly known as Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance) through a local Area Agency on Aging in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota (USA). Overall, the program was successfully implemented resulting in adoption by local community organizations serving Asian and, to a lesser degree, East African non-English speaking older adults. Bilingual community instructors were trained to lead the classes resulting in broad participation and improved physical performance by the older adults targeted for the intervention. The results from this pilot study indicate that Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance can be implemented with positive results in non-English speaking community settings using bilingual leaders.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose is to provide an overview of a 20-year research program aimed at testing diabetes self-management education interventions culturally tailored for Mexican Americans residing in an impoverished rural community on the Texas-Mexico border., METHODS: The research program involved focus group interviews to obtain community input, pilot testing to refine instruments and interventions, and community-based randomized controlled trials to examine intervention effects. Here the authors summarize lessons learned related to the (1) overall effects of culturally tailored diabetes self-management education; (2) impact of culture on study design, intervention development, health outcomes, and community acceptance; (3) benefits of and findings from multiple focus groups held over time in the community; and (4) personal and cultural motivators for behavioral change that were evident among study participants., RESULTS: Postintervention reductions in A1C ranged from 1.4 to 1.7 percentage points. Individuals who attended {\textgreater}= 50\% of intervention sessions achieved a 6-percentage point reduction in A1C. Intervention teams included bilingual Mexican American nurses, dietitians, and promotoras, all recruited from the local community. Focus group interviews indicated that a traditional promotora model was not acceptable to the participants who wanted knowledgeable health professionals, or perceived authority figures, to lead intervention sessions while promotoras provided logistical support. Free glucometers and strips, family participation, and interpersonal dynamics within intervention groups motivated individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices., CONCLUSIONS: Culturally tailored diabetes interventions are effective in improving the health of socially disadvantaged minorities who bear a disproportional burden of type 2 diabetes, and these interventions are cost-effective.Copyright Â© 2014 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This was a model of community engagement for a Hispanic population in East Harlem, New York City to assess health care decision-making processes, with a focus on end-of-life decisions, among older men and women. The design involved two senior center-based semi-structured focus groups conducted in Spanish and English followed by a series of bilingual skills-building workshops focusing on situational decision-making. All program aspects were conducted between April and June of 2013. The themes for the workshops included: "Getting the most from your pharmacist encounter;" "How to prepare for your primary care visit;" and "I am getting discharged from the hospital: what do I do?" For the two focus groups, 21 community members participated, each of whom self-identified as Hispanic or Latina/o. Ten common themes emerged from a two-stage/two coder, grounded theory-based qualitative analysis and included: Where Community Members Receive Care; General Challenges, Cultural Challenges, and Benefits of Health Care in New York City/East Harlem; Key Facilitators in Health Care Decision Making; Key Facilitators in End-of-Life Decision Making; and Perceptions of Health Care Disparity. Themes and their subcategories, discussed herein, may offer guidance for area health providers and health care delivery entities.

PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid, and PsycINFO were searched for analyses and syntheses of primary research published since 2000 that described interventions tailored for the cultures of Asian immigrants with diabetes. This search yielded a total of 9 articles published from 2005 to 2013. The Amsterdam-Maastricht Consensus List for Quality Assessment was used to assess the quality of the studies., RESULTS: Retrieved studies' populations were foreign-born adults {\textgreater}50 years of age with type 2 diabetes.

VCOs recruited 151 participants from existing service users in three groups: Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) communities, older people ({\textgreater}75yrs) and families with young children. Researchers conducted two semi-structured interviews with each participant, a week apart. The first interview asked about demographics, current energy supplier, financial situation, previous experience of tariff-switching and barriers to switching. Researchers then provided the 'intervention' - advice on tariff-switching, printed materials, access to websites. The second interview explored usefulness of the 'intervention', other information used, remaining barriers and information needs. Researchers kept case notes and a reflective log. Data was analysed thematically and collaboratively between the research coordinator and researchers. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS, with descriptive statistics and Chi-squared tests. A total of 151 people were interviewed: 47 older people over 75 years, 51 families with young children, 51 BME (two were missing demographics). Result(s): The majority were not White British or UK-born. Average household weekly income was 230. Around half described 'difficult' financial situations, 94\% were receiving state benefits and 62\% were in debt. Less than a third had tried to find a better energy deal; knowledge was the main barrier. After the intervention 19 people tried to switch, 13 did. Young families were most likely to switch, older people least. The main reasons for not switching were apathy ('can't be bothered'), lack of time, fear or scepticism and loyalty. Older people were particularly affected by apathy and scepticism. The personalized advice and help with websites was especially valued. Conclusion(s): Low-income consumers appear to have considerable apathy to switching energy tariffs, despite potential savings and health benefits, in part due to their complex lives in which switching is not a priority. An independent, one-on-one, personalized 'intervention' encouraged switching, particularly for young families. However, older people still experience significant barriers to switching with specific interventions needed, which take account of their status quo bias, energy use habits and scepticism. The recent integration of public health and local government in the UK may provide the ideal environment for providing similar services which are desperately needed to reduce fuel poverty in these groups in line with the new Public Health Strategy.

	volume = {128},
	abstract = {Background: Great strides have been made in improving the nation's heart health during the last two decades, health disparities still exist within many ethnic minority populations. These individuals often suffer from insufficient health literacy, which severely limits their ability to make appropriate health decisions. In particular, as a member of first generation immigrant groups, Korean American seniors (KAS) with chronic disease such as hypertension encounter very stiff language and cultural barriers to accessing the complicated U.S health care system and have only limited personal resources. Purposes/ methods: To address this unmet health need of this underserved group, we designed a community-based clinical trial to test the efficacy of a comprehensive HBP management program that focused on health literacy among Korean American senior (KAS). The health literacy self-help intervention program for HBP (HL-SHIP-HBP) was a community-based, prospective controlled trial targeting KAS with hypertension in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Using an adaptive stratified randomization method, we selected a total of 22 ethnic Korean churches and senior centers in the region for use as study sites on the basis of their size and location, then randomly assigned each of them as either an intervention group site or control group site. Eligible members from each site were then screened and enrolled in the study. Eligibility criteria: Participants were Korean Americans 60 years of age or older, with systolic BP (SBP) {\textgreater} 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) {\textgreater} 90 mm Hg on two separate measurements or on antihypertensive medication. Result(s): A total of 369 KAS (mean age, 70.9 +/- 5.3 years) completed the program: 184 in the intervention and 185 in the control group. Main outcomes were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. The findings indicate that the program (HL-SHIP-HBP) was effective in controlling BP in this ethnic/linguistic minority population. The BP control rates of the intervention and control groups were 49.5\% vs. 43.2\% at baseline, 58.5\% vs. 42.4\% at 6 months, 67.9 vs. 52.5 at 12 months, and 54.3\% vs. 53.0\% at 18 months. The potential contribution of health literacy to the long-term sustainability of HBP control will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, health scientists are becoming aware that research collaborations that include community partnerships can be an effective way to broaden the scope and enhance the impact of research aimed at improving public health. Such collaborations extend the reach of academic scientists by integrating a variety of perspectives and thus strengthening the applicability of the research. Communication challenges can arise, however, when attempting to address specific research questions in these collaborations. In particular, inconsistencies can exist between scientists and community members in the use and interpretation of words and other language features, particularly when conducting research with a biomedical component. Additional challenges arise from differing perceptions of the investigative process. There may be divergent perceptions about how research questions should and can be answered, and in expectations about requirements of research institutions and research timelines. From these differences, misunderstandings can occur about how the results will ultimately impact the community. These communication issues are particularly challenging when scientists and community members are from different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds that may widen the gap between ways of talking and thinking about science, further complicating the interactions and exchanges that are essential for effective joint research efforts. Community-driven research that aims to describe the burden of disease associated with Helicobacter pylori infection is currently underway in northern Aboriginal communities located in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, with the goal of identifying effective public health strategies for reducing health risks from this infection. This research links community representatives, faculty from various disciplines at the University of Alberta, as well as territorial health care practitioners and officials. This highly collaborative work will be used to illustrate, from a researcher's perspective, some of the challenges of conducting public health research in teams comprising members with varying backgrounds. The consequences of these challenges will be outlined, and potential solutions will be offered.},

	abstract = {Background: Chinese Americans are the largest Asian subgroup in the U.S., and many are recent immigrants with high rates of cancer, a leading cause of death for this population. Although Chinese American patients frequently present with advanced illness and poorly controlled pain, information on symptom burden in this population is very limited. As part of an ongoing community study to test the effectiveness of a rapid-cycle quality improvement (QI) intervention to enhance symptom management, we evaluated the prevalence and burden of cancer symptoms in a large sample of first-generation, non-English speaking, ethnic Chinese patients. Method(s): A consecutive sample of Chinese American patients in two large community-based oncology practices and one hospital-based practice in New York were screened for cancer symptoms. Eligible adults who self-identified as ethnic Chinese, spoke Cantonese or Mandarin as their primary language, and had a history of cancer completed translated instruments assessing symptom prevalence, severity, and distress administered by bilingual research assistants. The study was approved by the IRB at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Result(s): Of 1,018 cancer patients screened to date (62.2\% women; M age = 64.0 years (SD = 13.7, range = 23 to 101); 20.6\% reported persistent cancer pain for the past month. The most common cancers were breast (34.3\%) lung (12.6\%), and head and neck (11.8\%) and 41.9\% were undergoing active treatment. The mean worst pain intensity on a 0-10 numeric scale was 5.5 (SD = 2.2), with 34.4\% rating their worst pain as {\textgreater} 6 of 10. Many (84.5\%) reported other symptoms, including fatigue (54.4\%), dry mouth (52.4\%), difficulty sleeping (44.8\%), and drowsiness (37.5\%). Overall, 32.7\% rated their symptoms as "quite a bit" or "very much" distressing, with sleep disturbance (33.1\%), lack of appetite (31.3\%), and constipation (29.2\%) causing the most severe distress. Conclusion(s): Symptom burden is high among community-dwelling, economically-disadvantaged ethnic Chinese cancer patients. Our ongoing QI intervention may alleviate the high symptom rate in this population and clarify potential patient, provider, and system-related factors that are associated with symptom control outcomes.},

	abstract = {Effective rural hygiene and sanitation promotion (RHSP) is a major challenge for many low-income countries. This paper investigates strategies and stakeholders' roles and responsibilities in RHSP implementation in a multi-ethnic area of northern Vietnam, in order to identify lessons learned for future RHSP. A stakeholder analysis was performed, based on 49 semi-structured individual interviews and one group interview with stakeholders in RHSP in a northern province of Vietnam. Participants came from three sectors (agriculture, health and education), unions supported by the Vietnamese government and from four administrative levels (village, commune, district and province). The study villages represented four ethnic minority groups including lowland and highland communities. Stakeholders' roles, responsibilities and promotion methods were outlined, and implementation constraints and opportunities were identified and analysed using thematic content analysis. Effective RHSP in Vietnam is severely constrained despite supporting policies and a multi-sectorial and multi-level framework. Four main barriers for effective implementation of RHSP were identified: (1) weak inter-sectorial collaborations; (2) constraints faced by frontline promoters; (3) almost exclusive information-based and passive promotion methods applied; and (4) context unadjusted promotion strategies across ethnic groups, including a limited focus on socio-economic differences, language barriers and gender roles in the target groups. Highland communities were identified as least targeted and clearly in need of more intensive and effective RHSP. It is recommended that the Vietnamese government gives priority to increasing capacities of and collaboration among stakeholders implementing RHSP activities. This should focus on frontline promoters to perform effective behaviour change communication. It is also recommended to support more participatory and community-based initiatives, which can address the complex socio-economic and cultural determinants of health in multi-ethnic population groups. These lessons learned can improve future RHSP in Vietnam and are also of relevance for health promotion in other minority population groups in the region and globally.},

Consequently, there have been calls for culturally appropriate services for people with chronic disease in CALD populations. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of culturally appropriate interventions to manage or prevent chronic disease in CALD communities. Evidence was sought from randomized controlled trials and controlled studies that examined strategies for promoting cultural competence in health service delivery to CALD communities. The outcomes examined included changes in consumer health behaviours, utilisation/satisfaction with the service, and the cultural competence of health-care providers. Of the 202 studies that were identified only 24 met the inclusion criteria. The five categories of intervention that were identified included: (1) the use of community-based bi-lingual health workers; (2) providing cultural competency training for health workers; (3) using interpreter service for CALD people; (4) using multimedia and culturally sensitive videos to promote health for CALD people and (5) establishing community point-of-care services for CALD people with chronic disease. The review supported the use of trained bi-lingual health workers, who are culturally competent, as a major consideration in the development of an appropriate health service model for CALD communities.

Methodology: Comments regarding community learning experiences were gathered from year three and four students using mixed methods. Data was themed using a grounded theory approach. Result(s): Students' perceptions of non-English language consultations were frequently negative. They suggested that little learning was possible in this environment and the overall experience was viewed poorly. Students enjoyed talking to patients but this was much harder if they had no shared language. Discussion and Conclusion(s): Implications of students' perceptions of medical interactions with patients who do not speak English are important in a globally mobile population. Concepts such as cultural competency, professionalism,2 and patient centredness3 may be lost without addressing this issue.

	abstract = {With 28\% of Australia's population having a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background, the health system faces an increasing challenge to provide accessible and culturally competent health care. The view that all CALD communities are homogenous and solutions can be developed for the entire nation is detrimental. Despite available health services, CALD communities are reluctant to use them due to cultural differences, perceived racism and misunderstandings leading to the existing health disparities. Therefore, gathering data from four prominent CALD communities, such as the Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese communities in Logan, Queensland, about how they perceive and use health services can provide insightful information towards development of a service model that will better suit these CALD communities. The objective of the study was to examine the extent to which four prominent CALD communities (Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese) access and use health services in Logan, Queensland. Six focus group interviews using interpreters were conducted in English with Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese people. The results indicated that even long-standing CALD communities, such as the Pacific Islander people, were unfamiliar with health services and experienced difficulties accessing appropriate health care. Most wanted doctors to use traditional healing methods alongside orthodox medicine, but did not feel respected for their beliefs. Language difficulties impeded communication with health professionals who were hindered by ineffective use of interpreters. In conclusion, a clear role for bilingual community-based navigators was identified by CALD participants to address concerns about the health system, and to improve accessibility and health service usage.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Support of organ donation among Asian Americans has been limited, but lack of access to information and prevalence of misinformation are 2 barriers that might be counteracted by public education. OBJECTIVE(S): To solicit advice from 4 Asian American communities on the design of a culturally appropriate educational campaign on organ donation and transplantation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional, multilingual survey administered at community festivals and supermarkets. PARTICIPANTS: 201 Asian American respondents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The components of an effective public education outreach campaign on organ donation were defined for 4 Asian American communities. RESULT(S): Media venues ranked highest for information dissemination on organ donation/transplantation were, in descending order, mainstream television, ethnic newspapers, mainstream newspapers, and ethnic television. Most respondents preferred a spokesperson of Asian American descent, but opinions differed by ethnicity as to whether an effective spokesperson needed to be of the same Asian ethnicity as the respondents. Respondents were further divided by ethnicity on their preference for a locally or nationally well-known spokesperson. The most compelling scenario to promote organ donation was an Asian American waiting for a transplant, followed by an organ donor family or individual, and, last, a transplant recipient. Different advertisements for organ donation appealed to different Asian ethnic groups. CONCLUSION(S): Community-based research gives communities the opportunity to collaborate with health professionals in designing health education programs that target their own populations. Because key aspects influencing campaign efficacy can vary by ethnicity, these important differences need to be taken into account in outreach planning.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The workforce in all areas of United States agriculture and forestry is becoming increasingly diverse in language, culture, and education. Many agricultural workers are immigrants who have limited English language skills and limited educational attainment. Providing safety and health training to this large, diverse, dispersed, and often transient population of workers is challenging. This review, prepared for the 2010 Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conference, "Be Safe, Be Profitable: Protecting Workers in Agriculture," is divided into five sections. First, we describe the occupational and demographic characteristics of agricultural workers in the United States to highlight their safety and health training needs. Second, we summarize current research on the social and cultural attributes of agricultural workers and agricultural employers that affect the provision of safety and health training. Worker and employer attributes include language, literacy, financial limitations, work beliefs, and health beliefs. Third, we review current initiatives addressing safety and health training for agricultural workers that consider worker language and literacy. These initiatives are limited to a few specific topics (e.g., pesticides, heat stress); they do not provide general programs of safety training that would help establish a culture of workplace safety. However, several innovative approaches to health and safety training are being implemented, including the use of community-based participatory approaches and lay health promoter programs. Fourth, the limited industry response for safety training with this linguistically diverse and educationally limited workforce is summarized. Finally, gaps in knowledge and practice are summarized and recommendations to develop educationally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate safety and health training are presented.},

	abstract = {There are few data on the relationships of anxiety and depression to insomnia among immigrants in the United States. Observations of high rates of symptoms of these associated conditions among older Russians indicate the need to focus clinical atention on this population. Relationships of self-reported depression and anxiety to insomnia complaints were investigated in a community-based sample of older Russian immigrants. Volunteers (N = 307) were urban community-residing Russians (ages 50 to 95 years; 54\% women). Surveys were conducted in a semistructured environment by bilingual educators in various community centers. 93\% reported a major health problem, 83\% experienced pain, and 62\% had problems engaging in daily activities. Of the sample, 61\% reported an insomnia complaint, and 43\% considered depression and/or anxiety to be a major impairment. Logistic regression analysis showed that insomnia was the most important predictor of perceived anxiety and depression; the corresponding multivariate-adjusted odds ratio was 4.37. Insomnia complaints and perceptions of depression and anxiety among older Russians may have a synergistic effect. Both patients and primary-care physicians should be beter educated regarding the recognition of barriers limiting access to adequate health care among older Russians. Â© Psychological Reports 2010.},

	volume = {141},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.023},
	abstract = {Background: Compared with Whites, many ethnic minority groups have higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The reasons for these ethnic inequalities in health are incompletely understood. The main objective was to examine whether socio-economic position (SEP) as measured by education was related to the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in different ethnic groups in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Method(s): A random sample of healthy adults aged 35-60 years. SEP was measured by educational level (secondary school and below (low), and vocational school and above (high)). Metabolic syndrome was measured according to the International Diabetic Federation guidelines. Result(s): Low education was negatively related to metabolic syndrome but only in White-Dutch people. Among White-Dutch men, the age adjusted prevalence ratio (95\% confidence intervals) for low education was 1.46 (95\% CI: 1.01-2.10) versus high education. Among White-Dutch women, the adjusted odds ratios for low education was 2.26 (95\% CI: 1.39-3.68) versus high education. In both White-Dutch men and women, low education was related to several components of metabolic syndrome. Among African-Surinamese and Hindustani-Surinamese, no significant associations were found between low education and metabolic syndrome and its components. Conclusion(s): Low education is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome among White-Dutch people but not among other ethnic groups. Community-based strategies to improve metabolic profiles may have to be ethnically devised. Among White-Dutch, targeting people with lower SEP may have an impact. However, among ethnic minority groups, both low and high socio-economic groups may have to be equally targeted to have an impact in reducing ethnic inequalities in health.

	volume = {34},
	doi = {10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.01.009},
	abstract = {Objective: To survey the self-perceived capability of medically oriented child maltreatment teams in the US to provide mental health referrals and services when needed and to evaluate children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Method(s): Mailed questionnaire with 5 items related to mental health, 12 items on services for CSHCN, and 28 items on financial issues previously reported. Result(s): Responses were received from 320 of 472 organizations (67.8\%); 153 respondents had at least 1 physician or nurse practitioner and were included in the analysis; 91 were hospital-based teams (HBTs); and 62 were community-based teams (CBTs). CBTs were significantly more likely to offer mental health treatment (65.0\% vs 35.6\%). When mental health services were needed in another language, only half (50.7\%) indicated that services were available in Spanish, less than a third (29.3\%) could find services in sign language, and only 20.3\% expected to find services for patients who used other languages. Of all children evaluated, 31.2\% had special health care needs. CBTs reported seeing significantly more CSHCN than HBTs (38.3\% vs 26.5\%). Over two-thirds (67.7\%) did not have a special program or specialized staff to serve CSHCN. Overall, teams had some training and experience with CSHCN. Children who were deaf were evaluated by 84.5\% of teams, while only 50.5\% reported using professionally trained sign language interpreters. Most teams (82.2\%) indicated that more time was needed to evaluate CSHCN, and 69.1\% found arranging for mental health treatment for CSHCN more difficult than children without special needs. Conclusion(s): Medically oriented child maltreatment teams are generally able to arrange for mental health services for the children served, and most feel capable of serving CSHCN. Significantly more mental health service providers are needed for children and families who communicate in languages other than English (e.g., Spanish, American Sign Language [ASL]). Practice implications: Our results suggest that medically oriented child maltreatment teams and mental health services for maltreated children would improve gaps in services by: (1) recruiting and training bilingual professionals, (2) ensuring that children or family members who are deaf receive professional ASL services, and (3) ensuring that training is provided related to the needs of CSHCN.

	volume = {17},
	url = {http://www.radcliffehealth.com/shop/quality-primary-care},
	abstract = {Background: Consumer participation in primary health care is important in providing quality consumer-focused care, but challenging when working with disadvantaged groups of diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Women's Health Services (WHS) works with women from over 60 different nationalities, including many newly arrived migrants and refugees. New arrivals access a wide range of WHS programmes including medical services, counselling, information, community talks and workshops, referral, and outreach, but few ethnic women attended the alcohol and other drug (AOD) services offered by the organisation. Aim(s): To establish an active consumer reference group to assist understanding and reducing the barriers to AOD services for a heterogeneous disadvantaged group that includes individuals from different cultural, language and educational backgrounds. Result(s): Leaning heavily on experiences from the mental health field, WHS overcame many practical and philosophical considerations which included: agreeing upon the purpose of the group and how it would operate within the structure of the organisation; the level of English language required by participants for the group to function; issues of resourcing the group; and ensuring an appropriate, workable demographic mix in terms of age, language, and migration experiences. Conclusion(s): The process and the outcome of establishing a consumer reference group (CRG) in a primary healthcare setting has been valuable for consumers' and health service providers within the organisation.

	abstract = {The presence of Latinos in Virginia is a new phenomenon and as a result, less is known about the health needs of these newest community members. We formed a community-university partnership to identify health concerns and service needs as they relate to Latino youth living in Richmond, Virginia and the surrounding area. Using a mixed-method approach, survey data was obtained from 212 Latino adults, qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 community leaders and focus groups with 23 Latino parents (16 mothers, 7 fathers) and 6 Latino boys. Participants expressed concern about sexually transmitted infections/pregnancy among youth (76\%), youth behavior problems at home/school (75\%), and mental health problems (75\%). Participants also expressed worry that youth would lose their connection to their Latin culture (83\%). Qualitative data provided more information regarding these concerns by linking them with inter-ethnic tensions, and immigration and acculturation-related stressors. Survey participants also indicated a need for bilingual mental health services (88\%) and after-school programs for youth (94\%). This study provided the local community with information on the health concerns and service needs of a new group of community youth-Latino youth. Findings were presented to local community and City organizations that used the information to respond to the identified needs and/or concerns. The process in which the data was obtained may prove useful to other individuals interested in obtaining local level health information in emerging communities.

	doi = {10.1016/j.canep.2009.10.001},
	abstract = {Background: Despite evidence of a decline in both incidence and prevalence of colorectal cancer nationwide, it remains the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third highest cause of mortality among Asian Americans, including Korean Americans. This community-based and theoretically guided study evaluated a culturally appropriate intervention program that included a bilingual cancer educational program among Korean Americans including information on CRC risks, counseling to address psychosocial and access barriers, and patient navigation assistance. Method(s): A two-group quasi-experimental design with baseline and post-intervention assessment and a 12-month follow-up on screening was used in the study. Korean Americans (N = 167) were enrolled from six Korean churches. The intervention group received culturally appropriate intervention program addressing accessibility and psychosocial barriers, and navigation assistance for screening. The control group received general health education that included cancer-related health issues and screening. Result(s): There was a significant difference (p {\textless} 0.05) between the post-intervention and control groups in awareness of CRC risk factors. There was also a significant improvement in the pre-post across HBM measures in the intervention group for perceived susceptibility (p {\textless} 0.05) and benefits and barriers to screening (p {\textless} 0.001). At baseline, 13\% of participants in the intervention group and 10\% in control group reported having had a CRC cancer screening test in the previous year. At the 12-month post-intervention follow-up, 77.4\% of participants in the intervention group had obtained screening compared to 10.8\% in the control group. Conclusion(s): While health disparities result from numerous factors, a culturally appropriate and church-based intervention can be highly effective in increasing knowledge of and access to, and in reducing barriers to CRC screening among underserved Koreans.

	abstract = {Prevention remains key in the fight against HIV/AIDS. However, prevention requires understanding the sociocultural and economic context in which HIV-risk behaviors occur. This qualitative, descriptive study was part of the initial phase of a larger project to adapt and test a community-based HIV-prevention intervention. We conducted individual interviews with rural Malawian community leaders and focus groups with adult community residents to elicit perceptions of both sexual and non-sexual HIV-risk behaviors and their sociocultural context. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in Chichewa, audio-taped, transcribed and translated into English by bilingual co-investigators. Content analysis of transcripts was done collaboratively by US-based and Malawian co-investigators to confirm culturally accurate interpretation of data. Participants identified sexual and non-sexual HIV-risk behaviors and contextual factors that influence these behaviors, including gender relations, cultural practices, economic conditions and religion. Community leaders and residents voiced similar perspectives on risk behaviors, except that community leaders were much less likely than residents to discuss sexual transmission through participation in traditional cultural practices. We incorporated these study results in adapting our HIV-prevention intervention to the sociocultural context of rural Malawi.

	abstract = {Objective: To increase Aboriginal participation with mainstream health professionals in an Aboriginal health and well-being centre. Design(s): Participatory Action Research using Aboriginal traditional symbolism to depict aspects of the research process, interview surveys and a document review. Setting(s): A regional town with 629 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander residents and a newly established Aboriginal health and well-being centre (Nunyara). Participant(s): Thirty Aboriginal community members were interviewed about their involvement with Nunyara and their health issues. Participants were selected through purposive 'pass-me-around' sampling to ensure that all family groups were included. Result(s): The results are presented in two areas: the structure of the Aboriginal community that affects participation and community views about health issues. Aboriginal people living in the town come from 10 or more different language groups and relate almost exclusively within their own groups. Activities at Nunyara were seen as individual family group events and not for everyone. Aboriginal community participants had a broad view of health as they reported problems that included smoking and alcohol use. Almost all would like more involvement in health issues through Nunyara. Conclusion(s): Aboriginal community members are willing to get involved in health issues in collaboration with Nunyara. However, fundamental to increasing participation is to bring people together from different family groups and increase social cohesion. This can be done through developing relationships with groups enabling different points of view to be heard and valued.

	abstract = {In the United States, approximately 78\% of agricultural farmworkers are immigrants. In Oregon, a growing number of these farmworkers are indigenous and speak an indigenous language as their primary language. This group of farmworkers suffers from linguistic, cultural and geographic isolation and faces a unique set of challenges yet little has been done to identify their health needs. Using data from focus groups, partners from this community-based participatory research project examined indigenous farmworkers' concerns regarding occupational injury and illness, experiences of discrimination and disrespect, and language and cultural barriers. The data revealed examples of disrespect and discrimination based on the languages and cultures of indigenous farmworkers, and a lack of basic occupational health and safety information and equipment. For example, participants mentioned that occupational safety information was inaccessible because it was rarely provided in indigenous languages, and participants felt there were no legal means to protect farmworkers from occupational hazards. Community-based strategies designed to address the occupational health status of farmworkers must consider the unique circumstances of those farmworkers who do not speak Spanish or English.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define the prevalence and overlap of symptom patterns traditionally associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and incontinence among men and women in a racially and ethnically diverse, community-based population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In all, 5506 men and women aged 30-79 years were recruited to participate in the Boston Area Community Health Survey, using a stratified-cluster sampling technique to obtain roughly similar representative samples by age group, gender and race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic). Survey data were collected by bilingual interviewers in subjects' homes. Scales measuring symptom patterns were derived from validated instruments, with minor changes to eliminate different recall periods and overlap in items that might have confused subjects. RESULT(S): About a quarter of men and women of all ages met the definition for one or more of the target symptom patterns; there was no significant variation in the prevalence of any of the symptom patterns by race/ethnicity. Overall, =16\% of men and women had one symptom pattern, while 7\% had overlap patterns. Except for urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in both men and women, the prevalence of all symptom complexes were associated with one another significantly more often that would be expected by chance. CONCLUSION(S): Overlapping patterns of lower urinary tract symptoms and pelvic pain are common. These overlapping patterns present challenges for clinical practice and research, and require further investigation of their causes, diagnosis and optimum treatment. Â© 2007 The Authors.},

	volume = {35},
	abstract = {To address disparities in access to health care information, we developed a model program of community-based, health education workshops to be delivered in English and Spanish to older urban adults from diverse ethnic, cultural, and language backgrounds. The workshops were created through an interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty from seven health care professions and focused on three healthcare topics identified in Healthy People 2010: dementia and depression, stress reduction, and physical activity. The development of workshop content and structure, including didactic and interactive components, an approach to interdisciplinary student involvement, and program evaluation by clients and community center staff, are presented as a model for other educators. The workshops presented at five senior centers were attended by 1110 mostly female clients with an average age of 74 yrs and with a large proportion self-identified as of minority background. One hundred seven students from seven healthcare programs helped deliver the workshops. Interviews and surveys of the clients demonstrated that most had a positive learning experience, whereas the evidence of intent to take action on health care issues was less definitive. Analysis of student essays demonstrated increased student understanding of older adults and of community services. A website, Geriatric Educational Resources for Instructors and Elders (www.GERIE.org), was created to provide access to the instructional and resource materials used for the workshops, including presentation materials in Spanish. This model program may help address the substantial health education needs of a growing population of older adults from diverse ethnic, cultural, and language minorities.},

Comparisons of participants by primary language (Asian language vs. English) and immigration status (undocumented vs. documented/citizen) show that Asian-primary-language and undocumented participants at baseline had a significantly lower rate of receipt of primary care services and experienced significantly more barriers per service than English-primary-language and documented participants. At follow-up, however, differences by primary language and immigration status disappeared, indicating that the Bridges Project was effective in improving service utilization and reducing barriers for the Asian-primary-language and undocumented participants. Barriers to services reported most frequently by participants were language and cost barriers, not knowing where to go for services, and confidentiality concerns. Study findings indicate that the capacity to address multiple API languages and cultures is essential in providing culturally competent care to APIs living with HIV.},

	title = {A process for developing community consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder},
	volume = {115},
	abstract = {There remain large discrepancies between pediatricians' practice patterns and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the assessment and treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several studies raise additional concerns about access to ADHD treatment for girls, blacks, and poorer individuals. Barriers may occur at multiple levels, including identification and referral by school personnel, parents' help-seeking behavior, diagnosis by the medical provider, treatment decisions, and acceptance of treatment. Such findings confirm the importance of establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that children of both genders and all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups receive appropriate assessment and treatment. Publication of the AAP ADHD toolkit provides resources to assist with implementing the ADHD guidelines in clinical practice. These resources address a number of the barriers to office implementation, including unfamiliarity with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, difficulty identifying comorbidities, and inadequate knowledge of effective coding practices. Also crucial to the success of improved processes within clinical practice is community collaboration in care, particularly collaboration with the educational system. Such collaboration addresses other barriers to good care, such as pressures from parents and schools to prescribe stimulants, cultural biases that may prevent schools from assessing children for ADHD or may prevent families from seeking health care, and inconsistencies in recognition and referral among schools in the same system. Collaboration may also create efficiencies in collection of data and school-physician communications, thereby decreasing physicians' non-face-to-face (and thus nonreimbursable) elements of care. This article describes a process used in Guilford County, North Carolina, to develop a consensus among health care providers, educators, and child advocates regarding the assessment and treatment of children with symptoms of ADHD. The outcome, ie, a community protocol followed by school personnel and community physicians for {\textgreater}10 years, ensures communication and collaboration between educators and physicians in the assessment and treatment of children with symptoms of ADHD. This protocol has the potential to increase practice efficiency, improve practice standards for children with ADHD, and enhance identification of children in schools. Perhaps most importantly, the community process through which the protocol was developed and implemented has an educational component that increases the knowledge of school personnel about ADHD and its treatment, increasing the likelihood that referrals will be appropriate and increasing the likelihood that children will benefit from coordination of interventions among school personnel, physicians, and parents. The protocol reflects a consensus of school personnel and community health care providers regarding the following: (1) ideal ADHD assessment and management principles; (2) a common entry point (a team) at schools for children needing assessment because of inattention and classroom behavior problems, whether the problems present first to a medical provider, the behavioral health system, or the school; (3) a protocol followed by the school system, recognizing the schools' resource limitations but meeting the needs of community health care providers for classroom observations, psychoeducational testing, parent and teacher behavior rating scales, and functional assessment; (4) a packet of information about each child who is determined to need medical assessment; (5) a contact person or team at each physician's office to receive the packet from the school and direct it to the appropriate clinician; (6) an assessment process that investigates comorbidities and applies appropriate diagnostic criteria; (7) evidence-based interventions; (8) processes for follow-up monitoring of children after establishment of a treatment plan; (9) roles for central participants (school personnel, physicians, school nurses, and mental health professionals) in assessment, management, and follow-up monitoring of children with attention problems; (10) forms for collecting and exchanging information at every step; (11) processes and key contacts for flow of communication at every step; and (12) a plan for educating school and health care professionals about the new processes. A replication of the community process, initiated in Forsyth County, North Carolina, in 2001, offers insights into the role of the AAP ADHD guidelines in facilitating development of a community consensus protocol. This replication also draws attention to identification and referral barriers at the school level. The following recommendations, drawn from the 2 community processes, describe a role for physicians in the collaborative community care of children with symptoms of ADHD. (1) Achieve consensus with the school system regarding the role of school personnel in collecting data for children with learning and behavior problems; components to consider include (a) vision and hearing screening, (b) school/academic histories, (c) classroom observation by a counselor, (d) parent and teacher behavior rating scales (eg, Vanderbilt, Conner, or Achenbach scales), (e) consideration of speech/language evaluation, (f) screening intelligence testing, (g) screening achievement testing, (h) full intelligence and achievement testing if discrepancies are apparent in abbreviated tests, and (i) trials of classroom interventions. (2) Use pediatric office visits to identify children with academic or behavior problems and symptoms of inattention (history or questionnaire). (3) Refer identified children to the contact person at each child's school, requesting information in accordance with community consensus. (4) Designate a contact person to receive school materials for the practice. (5) Review the packet from the school and incorporate school data into the clinical assessment. (6) Reinforce with the parents and the school the need for multimodal intervention, including academic and study strategies for the classroom and home, in-depth psychologic testing of children whose discrepancies between cognitive level and achievement suggest learning or language disabilities and the need for an individualized educational plan (special education), consideration of the "other health impaired" designation as an alternate route to an individualized educational plan or 504 plan (classroom accommodations), behavior-modification techniques for targeted behavior problems, and medication trials, as indicated. (7) Refer the patient to a mental health professional if the assessment suggests coexisting conditions. (8) Use communication forms to share diagnostic and medication information, recommended interventions, and follow-up plans with the school and the family. (9) Receive requested teacher and parent follow-up reports and make adjustments in therapy as indicated by the child's functioning in targeted areas. (10) Maintain communication with the school and the parents, especially at times of transition (eg, beginning and end of the school year, change of schools, times of family stress, times of change in management, adolescence, and entry into college or the workforce).},

METHOD(S): This was a community-based telephone survey with subjects randomly selected from the population of specific cultural languages in Sydney. RESULT(S): Results indicated that Chinese and Arabic speaking parents or caregivers perceived the road environments as significantly less hazardous for their 4-12 year old children as pedestrians when compared with Vietnamese and English speaking parents. This was true even after adjusting for the age of child, socioeconomic status, and the living environments of respondents. CONCLUSION(S): The implication of the results was discussed in light of possible application to childhood safety behavior across different cultures. IMPACT TO THE INDUSTRY: The results obtained have highlighted the importance of cultural factors in risk perceptions, and safety behaviors. Cultural differences in risk perceptions should be taken into consideration in the design of safety education programs.},

Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to problem identification and exploration, a total of 74 Latino men (mean age 22.3, range 18-37) residing in an urban city in northwest North Carolina participated in one of eight focus groups on sexual health. Among the findings of this study, {\textgreater}75\% of participants reported Mexico as their country of origin; other participants reported being from Central and South American countries. Qualitative data analysis identified 13 themes, which were grouped into the following three domains: 1) psychosocial factors identified as influencing sexual risk health behaviors; 2) system-level barriers to sexual health; and 3) characteristics of potentially effective HIV prevention intervention approaches. The study findings suggest that community-based, male-centered interpersonal networks that provide individual and group education and skill-building and incorporate curanderos (Latino healers) and bilingual experts may be important elements of potentially effective intervention approaches to reach Latino men, who have been inaccessible to conventional HIV prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Objective: The Covering Kids and Families (CKF) program seeks to expand health insurance coverage for children by supporting community-based outreach and enrollment. For the evaluation of CKF, researchers conducted focus groups to explore parents' experiences accessing health care for their children, and to assess whether these experiences affected decisions to enroll their children in Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Method(s): In May and June 2003, 13 focus groups were conducted in 5 cities - Everett, MA; Denver, CO; Los Angeles, CA; Mena, AR; and San Antonio, TX. In each community, groups were conducted with parents of children insured under Medicaid or SCHIP and parents of uninsured children. Three groups were conducted with Spanish-speaking parents in two communities - Denver and Los Angeles. Result(s): Access to primary care was considered good by most parents with children in Medicaid and SCHIP. Among parents of uninsured children, there was more variation in perceptions of access to care. For parents of both uninsured and insured children, access to dentists and specialists was more problematic. Spanish-speaking families reported numerous barriers to care due to language differences and perceived discrimination. All focus group participants said that they placed great value on health insurance. Conclusion(s): Even when parents encountered problems accessing care, very few indicated that this discouraged them from enrolling their children into Medicaid or SCHIP, or from renewing their children's public coverage.

	abstract = {Context: Racial/ethnic differences in androgen levels could account for differences in prostate cancer risk, body composition, and bone loss. Objective(s): The objective of the study was to investigate racial/ethnic variations in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), SHBG, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels. Design(s): The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey was a multistage stratified cluster random sample, recruiting from 2002 to 2005. Setting(s): The study was a community-based sample of Boston. Participant(s): Participants included black, Hispanic, or white individuals, aged 30-79 yr, competent to sign informed consent and literate in English/Spanish. Of 2301 men recruited, 1899 provided blood samples (538 black, 651 Hispanic, 710 white). Intervention(s): Intervention consisted of data obtained during inperson at-home interview, conducted by a bilingual phlebotomist/ interviewer. Main Outcome Measure(s): Testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, DHT, DHT to testosterone ratio, SHBG, and DHEAS were measured. Result(s): With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity. DHEAS levels differed by race/ethnicity before covariate adjustment; after adjustment this difference was attenuated. Before adjustment, DHT and DHT to testosterone ratios did not significantly differ by racial/ethnic group. After adjustment, there was evidence of racial/ethnic differences in DHT (P = 0.047) and DHT to testosterone (P = 0.038) levels. Black men had higher DHT levels and DHT to testosterone ratios than white and Hispanic men. Conclusion(s): Because there are no racial/ethnic differences in testosterone levels, normative ranges need not be adjusted by race/ethnicity for androgen deficiency diagnosis for men aged 30-79 yr. Further investigation is needed to determine whether differences in DHT levels and DHT to testosterone ratio can help explain racial/ethnic variations in prostate cancer incidence, body composition, and bone mass.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop bilingual health advocate (BHA)-led group education and support groups for South Asian patients with diabetes, based on a storytelling format. The design and setting were action research in a deprived inner London district. The research team worked developmentally with BHAs, service users and other stakeholders to assess need, train staff, and set up and evaluate the storytelling groups. Stories were chosen as the main vehicle for education because of their universal appeal, memorability, holistic perspective, ethical dimensions, and potential for multiple interpretations. Key challenges in the project were: high burden of need; multiple stakeholders; a shifting baseline of policy directives; frequent staff changes; resource constraints; and resistance of top and middle management to new service models. These difficulties made progress slow, and several early initiatives failed to take root. However, we succeeded in developing a nationally accredited training programme ('Storytelling for group work in health and care') for BHAs, and in supporting the graduates from this course to set up two groups for South Asian patients with diabetes - one in a hospital and one in a community centre. The patient storytelling groups, once established, were popular and well evaluated. Blood glucose levels in regular attenders fell, but changes did not reach statistical significance. An action research approach allowed us successfully to develop an innovative training programme for BHAs and support them in developing and mainstreaming new service models. BHA-led diabetes storytelling groups, supported by health professionals, are feasible and popular with non-English speaking Asian patients. Their impact on diabetes outcomes should now be formally evaluated in clinical trials. Copyright Â© 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The project is also being promoted as a model of best practice in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community engagement. Listening to Ethnic Communities about Diabetes focused on Type 2 diabetes by developing, piloting and evaluating culturally appropriate primary and secondary prevention health promotion strategies with Maltese, Filipino and Vietnamese communities in the municipality of Brimbank, Victoria. One of the critical success factors for the project was that, while the project was grounded in a health promotion framework, the lead agency did not have a great deal of health expertise. Rather, the focus of its expertise was on relationships with ethnic communities. This allowed for a shift in traditional power structures as the communities were given a real voice and decision-making powers. While the health service providers had the clinical and practical knowledge and expertise in diabetes, it was the involvement of the ethno-specific organisations and ethnic community representatives that enabled the project to develop and pilot models of service provision which had relevance and accessibility to the target community. The project also demonstrated the value in utilising a diverse range of strategies that reflect the cultural practices and preferences of the target communities through being developed and tested in partnership with the communities.},

Data were obtained by group discussion and through the media using a structured format. Fifteen themes emerged which were grouped under three broad themes: firstly, the identification by group members of their perception of the 'differences' in social and cultural beliefs and behaviours of their individual community; secondly, the identification of characteristics of a culturally sensitive doctor; and lastly, recommendations for changes in medical training. New teaching has been introduced to the medical curriculum that incorporates the themes raised by the communities and which reflects consciousness raising and communication issues.

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for Latinos living in the United States. This population is generally unaware of important lifestyle or behavioral changes that can prevent CVD. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) designed and implemented Salud para su Corazon (Health for Your Heart), a culturally appropriate, community- based, theory-driven intervention model. NHLBI's goals were: (1) to design an intervention model appropriate to Latino populations; (2) to pilot test the model in a specific community with the objectives of increasing awareness about heart disease, raising knowledge about CVD prevention, and promoting heart-healthy lifestyles; and (3) to disseminate the model and the materials developed to other communities with similar needs. An agency-community partnership, under the leadership of the Community Alliance for Heart Health, guided all stages of the community intervention project. The multimedia bilingual community intervention included television telenovela format public service announcements (PSAs), radio programs, brochures, recipe booklets, charlas, a promotores training manual, and motivational videos. An evaluation survey assessed the impact of the intervention. A pre-post intervention survey was conducted with more than 300 participants, and results showed that the respondents were substantially more aware of risk factors for CVD, and had greatly increased their knowledge of ways to prevent heart disease. Dissemination efforts have resulted in numerous requests by health organizations, universities, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) for educational materials and communication strategies produced by Salud para su Corazon. In addition, Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcast television network, is airing the initiative's PSAs. Also, training seminars for promotores are being conducted in different regions of the United States, and several locations are planning to replicate this study.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to identify barriers to cancer prevention and evaluate the effectiveness of a cancer prevention project to screening for cervical and breast cancer among Spanish-speaking farmworkers in California's Central Valley. Bilingual health educators met with farmworkers communities near Merced and Modesto, CA, to determine barriers that prevented women from seeking screening for breast and cervical cancer. Using information from focus groups and health fairs, a targeted outreach protocol was developed that will eventually enroll 2,500 farmworkers in a cancer education and screening program. Participants received a presentation in Spanish on breast and cervical cancer that included a pretest and post-test to assess increases in knowledge. Clients were encouraged to attend Golden Valley Health Centers Inc. (GVHC) to receive free breast and cervical cancer screening. Vouchers, redeemable for modest personal hygiene gifts by clients, were tracked to assess prevention behavior when appointments were kept at GVHC. Sixty farmworkers attended focus groups and 363 attended health fairs to provide input to the cancer prevention program. As of December 1, 1995, 1,732 female farmworkers were enrolled in an outreach program designed to increase knowledge and promote cancer screening. Data from pretests and post-tests indicated a statistically significant increases in knowledge about cancer and its prevention among participants. Furthermore, 317 participants redeemed vouchers for cancer screening at GVHC. Active community collaboration and culturally appropriate intervention strategies, employed in conjunction with clinical services, can be successful in increasing cancer prevention awareness and screening among female farmworkers.},

	abstract = {This article examines strategies and methodologic issues for researchers to consider when conducting community-based research within a racial/ethnic minority community. Members of minority communities have considerable skepticism about the health care system and researchers who work under its auspices. To facilitate quality research, it is necessary to build a mutually beneficial partnership between the community and researchers. Suggested strategies for accomplishing this goal, such as seeking out information on the social and political forces shaping the community and developing the community's capacity to undertake research of this type, are described. Methodologic issues include the importance of community input in defining the minority population group and its leadership, the benefits and limitations of conducting comparative analysis, and the need for measurement tools and techniques that are culturally and socially appropriate. Minority and nonminority researchers must make a concerted effort to gain knowledge of and respect for a community whose culture, values, and beliefs may differ from their own.},

Immigrant families, those using English as a second language, and parents of children with severe behaviour problems were significantly more liklely to enrol in Community/Groups than Clinic/Individual PT. Parents in Community/Groups reported greater improvements in behaviour problems at home and better maintenance of these gains at 6-month follow up.

Survey results from women in three communities in the Greater Los Angeles Area were used to identify baseline information on knowledge, beliefs and practices regarding screening mammography. This needs assessment indicated significant differences in the rate of mammography screening by race, preferred language, community, age, education, imcome and predisposing attitudes and perceptions. For instance, Spanish-speaking women were much less likely to have heard about breast cancer in the past 12 months compared with their English-speaking counterparts. Hispanic women were also half as likely as White women to ever have a mammogram. The intervention activities being implemented in this education program respond to the various findings. A quasi-experimental design consisting of two treatment communities and one control community is used to evaluate the effects of the program. Formative evaluation methods are used as well. The details of the community interventions and the implications for health education practice are discussed.},

	volume = {104},
	abstract = {The Office of Minority Health (OMH) was established in December 1985 in response to recommendations developed by the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health. Originally, OMH's mission emphasized six health problems identified by the Task Force as priority areas: cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke; chemical dependency; diabetes; homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries; and infant mortality and low birth weight. OMH added HIV infection to the six health prioty areas after epidemiologic data showed that the representation of blacks and Hispanics was disproportionately high among persons reported with AIDS. Strategies to eliminate or reduce high-risk behaviors associated with HIV infection need to mobilize racial and ethnic minority communities and rebuild social networks in order to foster sustained behavioral changes. OMH created the Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program to demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies to expand the activities of minority community-based and national organizations involved in HIV education and prevention, as well as to encourage innovative approaches to address appropriately the diversities within and among minority populations. In 1988, grants totalling \$1.4 million were awarded to four national and 23 community-based minority organizations. Project workers conduct information, education, and prevention interventions directed to specific groups within racial and ethnic minority communities. Interventions include education and prevention training, information activities, developing educational materials, and providing technical assistance. Project innovations include conducting HIV education and prevention training for families at home, presenting a play produced and performed by local teenagers, and developing a workshop and a manual to help minority service organizations to recruit and train volunteer staff members. Working with minority community-based and national organizations is an essential component of effective strategies for preventing HIV infection among racial and ethnic minorities. OMH's Minority HIV Education/Prevention Grant Program encourages minority groups to participate as partners in Federal, State, and local HIV prevention efforts.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated disparities in mental health treatment for people of color in the USA. Meeting the needs of those most burdened by this disparity will require swift and tactical action in partnership with these communities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a community-based participatory research approach was employed to assess the priorities and needs of four communities of color (African immigrant, Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, and Pacific Islander) in a major U.S. city. A brief quantitative survey devised jointly by community leaders and the research team was deployed to community members (N = 59) in the fall of 2020. The most endorsed mental health issues across the communities were excessive worry (51\%) and stress regarding COVID-19, racism, and immigration policies (49\%). The most endorsed physical health concerns included sleep difficulties (44\%), headaches, and backaches (each 39\%). Physical symptoms predicted the endorsement of a mental health issue above and beyond COVID-19-related hardships, multiplying the odds of reporting an issue by 1.73 per physical health concern endorsed. Based on these findings, the community-research team conceptualized and proposed an evidence-based, effectiveness-implementation hybrid type-2 intervention approach for chronic worry and daily stress. This paper highlights detail on how the community-research team arrived at the proposed multilevel intervention that addresses community-stated barriers to mental health treatment (e.g., preferring trusted health workers to deliver emotional health treatments) and considers the burden of the additional stressful context of COVID-19.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Integrating best practices for health disparities to adapt evidence-based treatments is imperative to adequately meet the needs of diverse cultures, particularly ones that therapists can apply flexibility across multiple diverse communities., METHOD: Using a mixed-methods, community-engaged approach, we examined how a range of community participants (N = 169) defined mental health, perceived barriers to treatment, and used culturally based coping methods to manage their mental health. Phase 1 (n = 49) included qualitative focus group data from five distinct racial/ethnic communities (African immigrants/refugees, Black/African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, and American Indians). Phase 2 included quantitative surveys from members of four of these communities (n = 59) and the frontline providers serving them (n = 61)., RESULTS: The communities and providers highlighted chronic worry and distress related to daily activities as primary treatment concerns. Further, this mixed-methods data informed our proposed best practice treatment adaptation framework using chronic worry as an example., CONCLUSION: The main aims of this study were to exemplify best practices for addressing mental health inequities in communities of color in terms of (a) conducting health disparities research and (b) applying a treatment adaptation framework for culturally responsive clinical care. Specific features of how this framework was conceived and applied provide a unique and critical view into integrating best practices to address health disparities in diverse communities.

We used descriptive statistics to summarize provider characteristics and survey responses and univariate analysis to determine associations between them., RESULTS: Fifteen surgeons and 19 surgical residents completed the survey (49\% response rate). Most respondents were aware of and had a positive attitude toward SDM (91\% and 76\%, respectively); 35\% reported having SDM training. Providers had varying levels of engagement with different SDM practices, and there were inconsistent associations between provider characteristics and the use of SDM. Often providers thought the patient's health literacy, foreign primary language, clinical condition, and socioeconomic factors were barriers to the SDM process., CONCLUSIONS: Although most general surgery faculty and residents at our institution had a positive view of SDM, they engaged in SDM behaviors inconsistently, with no clear association between clinician characteristics and specific behaviors. We identified several barriers to SDM consistent with those identified by providers in other specialties. This highlights the need for further research to study live general surgery provider-patient interactions, as well as structured SDM education to train general surgery providers to reliably engage their patients in effective SDM.

Literature suggests that health communication inequalities play an important role in infant health knowledge gaps, thus contributing to the disparate IM rates. We sought to understand preferred methods of communication among expectant or mothers of young children of varying sociodemographics. We hypothesized that methods of communication would vary by sociodemographics., METHODS: A bilingual questionnaire, developed using community based participatory research principles was offered at pre-selected women's health agencies in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Participants chose from a researched list of 22 methods of communication and also designated their "top three choices." Communication methods were compared across sociodemographics using chi-squared statistical tests., RESULTS: A total of 292 participants completed the questionnaire at the various sites. Participants were predominantly White (60\%) or Hispanic/Latina (30\%), and lived in Frederick county/Winchester city (77\%). Of the 22 communication methods, the five most prevalent were: talking with a healthcare provider (91\%), family or friends (85-87\%), using internet (84\%), and handouts/booklets (80\%). Communication methods most frequently chosen as a "top three choice" were: internet (46\%), talking with healthcare providers (33\%), and talking with family (32\%). A higher preference for talking with a healthcare provider was noted among higher income individuals (100\%) compared to lower income (82\%; p-value=0.0062), a higher preference for call-in hotlines among Hispanic (49\%) vs. non-Hispanic women (15\%; p-value{\textless}0.0001), and a higher preference for placemats at fast-food restaurants among older women (42\%) compared to younger (16\%, p-value=0.0361)., CONCLUSION: Results suggest the incorporation of multiple methods may be a practical approach to reaching different segments of the population including those identified as most vulnerable for infant mortality.},

Most of these studies focused on individual-level factors predicting screening, but we are unaware of any that directly examined community and ecological influences. The goal of this project, Promoting Access to Health for Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian Women (PATH for Women), was to increase community capacity for breast and cervical cancer screening and follow up in Los Angeles and Orange counties. We focused on Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women because, although they have the lowest rates for cancer, compared to all other ethnic groups, relatively few programs have specifically targeted Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women to promote and sustain screening practices. The PATH for Women project involved a partnership between 5 community-based organizations and 2 universities, and included 7 Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities: Cambodians, Chamorros, Laotians, Thais, Tongans, Samoans, and Vietnamese. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing a Geographic Information System (GIS)-mapping evaluation component that was used to explore availability and accessibility to culturally responsive breast and cervical cancer screening services for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women in all 7 communities. We describe the methods used to develop the maps, and present the preliminary findings that demonstrate significant geographic and language barriers to accessing healthcare providers, services for breast and cervical cancer screening, and follow up, in each of the communities.

They viewed providers' knowledge, inquiry, and nonjudgmental acceptance of traditional Asian medical beliefs and practices as part of quality care. Patients also considered the quality of interpreter services to be very important. They preferred using professional interpreters rather than family members, and preferred gender-concordant translators. Furthermore, they expressed the need for help in navigating health care systems and obtaining support services., CONCLUSIONS: Cultural and linguistically appropriate health care services may lead to improved health care quality for Asian-American patients who have limited English language skills. Important aspects of quality include providers' respect for traditional health beliefs and practices, access to professional interpreters, and assistance in obtaining social services.},

Adapting the intervention for community-based delivery, and to address additional social determinants, may facilitate participation and increase acceptability and engagement among Latinx immigrant families. Purpose: To engage a stakeholder network in planning adaptations of an evidence-based weight management intervention for community-based implementation. Method: Guided by the intervention mapping-adapt process, we solicited feedback from a stakeholder network from August 2018 to March 2020. The stakeholder network assessed fit, planned adaptations and identified essential intervention components using photovoice, a Participatory Action Research method, and meetings incorporating user-centered design approaches. Results: The stakeholder network membership included Latinx immigrant families, community leaders, health care delivery experts, and researchers. Planned adaptations included curriculum changes to discuss social determinants barriers to behavior change and goal setting to mitigate them. Conclusions: We successfully engaged a stakeholder network and, using a systematic process, identified adaptations of an evidence-based weight management intervention to allow for community-based implementation. Sustainably addressing obesity disparities for Latinx children also requires addressing structural factors to reduce social determinants of health barriers at the population level.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Previous international research indicates that people with severe mental illness often experience lower levels of activity participation and may therefore be marginalized from occupational opportunities that support recovery. This study aimed to describe activity and participation patterns of consumers of mental health services living in the community and identify significant relationships with demographic characteristics. Method: A cross-sectional observational study design was utilized, via data mining of the Activity and Participation Questionnaires completed while receiving services from an area mental health service. Data for 282 consumers, who submitted 333 questionnaires, were included. Results: Consumers were mostly engaged in home-based and unpaid work, and their participation in these tasks significantly increased over time. Significant relationships were found between activity participation and age, gender and primary language. Consumers who were older were less likely to participate in employment, education and physical activity, while female and culturally and linguistically diverse consumers were less likely to engage in activities in the community. Conclusion: Demographic factors may have a significant impact on the ability of consumers to participate in activities. This may require targeted approaches to activity and participation interventions for specific groups of consumers.},

	abstract = {Group-based physical activity (PA) in community-based settings represents a promising avenue for promoting healthy ageing, however, lower levels of adherence have been found to be associated with aspects of social disadvantage. Providers are in a key position to provide important insights about strategies to improve adherence, however, few studies have examined their perspectives. In this study, 30 community service providers were interviewed, and 42 older people participated in focus groups to identify actions perceived as effective for promoting adherence to organised PA, with a focus on factors relevant to older people experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, social isolation, living with a disability or from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Data were analysed thematically. Adherence barriers included deteriorating health, lack of belonging and loss of motivation. Helpful strategies for addressing deteriorating health included maintaining programme flexibility, facilitating access to health and other services, and supporting participants to adapt to acquired limitations. Belonging can be fostered by creating positive and inclusive experiences, ensuring safe and stigma-free environments, providing opportunities to forge personal connections and demonstrating care. Motivation may be enhanced by ensuring activities are of interest and functional benefit, programme settings are suitable and appealing, and enjoyment is prioritised. In conclusion, a range of strategies is likely to be necessary to mitigate risks to adherence and support continued participation in organised PA among socially disadvantaged older people.},

Purpose: To examine points of tension that characterize culturally pluralistic care services in the United States, specifically Alaska, within context of Indigenous colonial histories. Design and Methods: The research design is ethnographic and multisited, comprising 12Â months of fieldwork across urban, rural and remote village sites in Alaska. A conceptual lens that accounts for culturally diverse social spaces where relations of power are at stake frames research presented here. This work incorporates relational and participatory action research principles with Alaska Native Elders. Ethnographic evidence was collected through multiple methods, including field notes, documents, and interviews, with ethnographic analysis involving atlas.ti. Findings: Alaska Native Elders describe salient points of tension characterizing Alaskaâs conventional care services through the following insights:generational curses-âa pain,prejudice on both sidesâwounded, andvalue-systems clashâfighting. Conclusion: This article concludes with discussion about collective anxieties and implications for care services.},

A community resilience/capacity framework, consisting of catalysts (primarily the creation of awareness) and capital components: human (workforce development), social (networking and empowerment) and economic (volunteer labor and money spent by the program), provided the conceptual underpinnings for the study. Focus groups with stakeholders in two communities, one rural and one metropolitan, were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed by categorizing data according to each capital component. In addition to the concepts contained in the capacity framework a new category, informational capital (data specific to the community) emerged during the analysis. We suggest that by acting as a catalyst a community based interprofessional program can affect components of community resilience/capacity, primarily human, social, and informational capital. Using the community resilience/capacity framework facilitated exploration of the perceived impact of an educational program on one rural and one urban underserved community beyond assessing student outcomes or number of clients served.},

Genesee County REACH activities address three core themes: fostering community mobilization, reducing racism, and enhancing the maternal-infant health care system. The REACH Community Action Plan was generated using a community-based participatory approach, and is based on a socio-ecological model with interventions focused at the individual, organizational, health system, and community levels. Genesee County REACH's Community Windshield Tours were developed to raise awareness of social and environmental barriers to health promotion among health care system staff in Flint, Michigan. These tours provide a close-up examination of the community's environmental conditions and the experiences of mothers, children, and families at risk for poor birth outcomes. In this article, we report our findings from pre-/post-tour surveys, as well as long-term follow-up surveys, to assess the impact of this REACH activity on participants' knowledge and beliefs about Genesee County residents, and to determine any resultant individual, policy, system, or environmental changes. We used t tests to compare participants' responses before and after the tours. We found that several individual- and systems-level changes have resulted from these tours, reflecting greater cultural sensitivity and increased understanding of patients' circumstances. African American infant mortality rates in Genesee County declined to a historic low in 2005, and they remain lower than in previous years. Although REACH coalition partners recognize that this reduction cannot be attributed to a single intervention or activity, REACH activities such as the Community Windshield Tours addressing multiple levels of the socio-ecological model may have had a synergistic effect.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increases in the availability, affordability, and promotion of high-calorie foods and beverages and decreased obligations for routine physical activity have fostered trends of increased obesity worldwide. In high-income, plural societies, above average obesity prevalence is often observed in ethnic minority communities, suggesting that obesity-promoting influences are more prevalent or potent in these communities. METHODS: An interdisciplinary group of scholars engaged in multiple rounds of focused discussion and literature review to develop a Community Energy Balance Framework (CEB). The objective was to explore the nature of the excess obesity risk in African descent and other ethnic minority populations and identify related implications for planning and evaluating interventions to prevent obesity. RESULTS: A key principle that emerged is that researchers and programmers working with ethnic minority communities should contextualize the food- and physical activity-related sociocultural perspectives of these communities, taking into account relevant historical, political, and structural contexts. This perspective underscores the fallacy of approaches that place the entire burden of change on the individual, particularly in circumstances of social disadvantage and rapid cultural shifts. CONCLUSION: The CEB framework is proposed for use and further development to aid in understanding potential health-adverse effects of cultural-contextual stresses and accommodations to these stresses.},

Twenty-seven Latino AYA survivors ({\textgreater}/=15 years of age) completed key informant interviews and 21 Latino parents participated in focus groups.Results: Both AYA survivors and parents identified two major facilitative factors for survivorship care: Involvement of the nuclear family in the AYA's survivorship care in the adult healthcare setting and including symptom communication in late effects discussions. Barriers to care included: perceived stigma of a cancer history and continued emotional trauma related to discussions about the childhood cancer experience.Conclusions: Barriers to survivorship care include cancer stigma for both patient and nuclear family, which can impact on seeking survivorship care due to constraints placed on discussions because it remains difficult to discuss 'cancer' years later. Future research can evaluate if these findings are unique to Latino childhood cancer survivors or are found in other populations of AYA cancer survivors transitioning to adult-centered healthcare. This community-based participatory research collaboration also highlights the opportunity to learn about the needs of childhood cancer survivors from the lens of community leaders serving culturally diverse populations.

The overall purpose of the Community University Research Alliance (CURA) study was to explore, develop, pilot, and evaluate how best to provide community-based mental health supports that are effective for people from culturally diverse backgrounds. Using a participatory action research approach within a multimethod design, the study partnership has developed an emerging framework that synthesizes the ideals of previous culture-oriented and power-oriented models. The emerging framework has 3 main components: values that guide concrete actions that in turn produce desired outcomes. Central to the emerging framework is the need for reciprocal collaboration between the mental health system and cultural-linguistic communities.Les services de santÃ© mentale des pays anglophones de l'Occident se dÃ©mÃ¨nent pour rÃ©pondre Ã  une diversitÃ© culturelle et raciale grandissante.

	abstract = {The underlying psychosocial processes that produce immigrant mental wellbeing are understudied in anthropology and medicine. This paper provides insights into these processes by describing culturally diverse immigrants' perceptions of mental health and adaptation strategies. Qualitative data were collected from 21 focus groups as part of a large, multidisciplinary, participatory action research project about mental health with five ethnolinguistic groups (Mandarin-speaking Chinese, Polish, Punjabi Sikh, Somali and Spanish-speaking Latin American) in Ontario, Canada. In framing the analysis, transformative concepts are applied to address dimensions of power and culture - social liminality and cultural negotiation - to the ongoing psychosocial processes of coping with mental distress. 'Social liminality' describes how immigrants perceive themselves to be in a psychologically stressful, transitional state, whereas 'cultural negotiation' describes how they actively cope with cultural tensions and respond to mental health challenges. Study findings show that while social liminality and cultural negotiation are stressful, they also have the potential to help individuals adapt by producing a positive synthesis of ideas about mental health in new social and cultural contexts. The study contributes to the shift from problem identification using a biomedical model of mental illness to a more psychosocial and ecological approach that reveals the potential for resolving some mental health problems experienced in immigrant communities. Describing active psychosocial process of adaptation also reinforces the therapeutic and educational value of partnerships between practitioners and clients and immigrant communities and mental health systems.},

Distinguishing features of the reform are the Local Collaboratives (LCs), regionally based community organizations designed by state government to represent behavioral health concerns of New Mexico's diverse cultural populations. We examine community response to the LCs, focusing on two broad sets of themes derived from 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork. The first set--structure and function--encompasses several issues: predominance of provider versus consumer voice; insufficient resources to support internal operations; imposition of state administrative demands; and perceived lack of state response to LC efforts. The second set--participation and collaboration--reveals how problems of information flow and other logistical factors impact involvement in LCs and how the construction of "community" introduced under this initiative exacerbates tensions across localities with varied histories and populations.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine whether culturally diverse adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health care behaviors is associated with the following social and cognitive variables: health self-efficacy, value placed on health, perceived barriers to health promotion, and perceptions regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care behaviors.Procedure: A cross-sectional study involving 108 high school students in health education classes was conducted. The majority of these participants (59.3\%) identified as a racial minority, and 68\% of these participants were female.Results: Health self-efficacy, value placed on health, and perceptions regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care practices were all significantly correlated with the participating adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health care behaviors. Primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative health care behaviors emerged as significant predictors of the participating adolescents' preventative health care behaviors.Conclusions: Present findings suggest that family and peers are likely role models for adolescents in the area of preventative health care behaviors. Thus, interventions to promote these behaviors among adolescents similar to those in the present study need to be family, school, and community-based.},

	abstract = {Objective. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) was launched in 1998 to address the disproportionate rates of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an evaluation to assess the influence of MAI in four communities, and the extent to which these communities increased their capacity to meet the HIV prevention needs of racial and ethnic minorities. Design. Retrospective data were collected annually through individual interviews over three years. Individual interviews were conducted with community stakeholders across the three waves of data collection. Data were analyzed using standardized qualitative methods including codebook development, coding, inter-coder agreement assessments, and data interpretation. This paper will highlight one area of inquiry - community stakeholders' perceptions of the impact of MAI in their communities. Results. Community stakeholders reported that MAI increased capacity to respond to the HIV epidemic and provide services to racial and ethnic minorities. Specifically, MAI was perceived to have increased community empowerment, involvement, and awareness of HIV/AIDS; expanded HIV-related services and organizational self-sufficiency; and improved collaboration and the coordination of services in the community. Although recognizing MAI gave national focus to the impact of the epidemic on minority communities, respondents raised concerns about the implementation process and the lack of sustainability planning. Conclusion. MAI represented an initial national attempt to address the disproportionate rates of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. However, other strategies are also needed to address these significant health disparities. At CDC, steps are currently underway to develop a comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS among racial and ethnic minorities. As community stakeholders are critical partners in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV, strengthening their capacity and promoting their involvement can help combat the epidemic.},

METHODS: African American and Latino adults with type 2 diabetes from 3 health care systems in Detroit, Michigan, participated in diabetes lifestyle intervention of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Detroit Partnership. The intervention curricula were culturally and linguistically tailored for each population. Trained community residents delivered the curricula in 5 group meetings aimed at improving dietary, physical activity, and diabetes self-care behaviors of study participants. The aims of the process evaluation were to assess participant satisfaction with the intervention, utility, and applicability of information and cultural relevance of intervention materials. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Matrices were developed along thematic lines, and common themes were determined by grouping responses by question. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants attended 1 or more intervention classes; 41\% attended all 5 meetings. Attendance rates ranged from 59\% to 88\% for individual meetings. Participants reported that program information and activities were useful, culturally relevant, and applicable to diabetes self-management. Participants also appreciated the convenient community location for meetings and the social support received from other participants. CONCLUSIONS: A community-based, culturally tailored diabetes lifestyle intervention delivered by trained community residents was associated with high participant satisfaction and retention.},

Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been suggested as a strategy to develop trust and build on the strengths of partners from various settings to address significant health issues, particularly those persistent health issues that reveal disparities among minority populations. There have been many challenges to developing these partnerships in the United States. The purpose of this paper is to discuss approaches and solutions used by this research team in response to the challenges they have faced in using CBPR. The team uses CBPR to understand and support the process of disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV) within the context of the community health centers that provide services for multicultural and multi-lingual populations. While CBPR provides a route to develop trust and build on the strengths of partners from various settings, there are multiple challenges that arise when partnering organizations present with different infrastructures, missions, resources and populations served. Examples of common challenges and solutions from the literature and from the team's experience will be discussed. Implications for partners, partnerships, practice and research will be explored.},

METHODS: Semi-structured, community-based interviews were conducted with contrasting key informant three-generation families; and generation by generation focus groups of grandparents, parents and children from four cultural communities in the state of Victoria, Australia. Purposive sampling occurred from Turkish, Greek, Indian and Chinese communities that have migrated to Australia within the last three generations (n = 160, eight families, 47 children aged 5-15 years, 29 parents, 42 grandparents). RESULTS: Evidence of two-way influences on eating and physical activity across three generations was evident, with children reporting the greatest cross-cultural diversity. A range of dietary restrictions was reported across all cultural groups. Efforts to foster healthy eating and lifestyle patterns within communities were evident. Parents, as a generation in particular, felt the need for more access to education and support regarding healthy limits for pre-puberty and puberty stages. CONCLUSION: There is a dynamic influence of culture on many aspects of family lifestyle across three generations. To achieve successful intervention design, childhood obesity researchers need to collaborate with diverse groups and communities. Considering the role and influence of extended family, a multigenerational, whole-of-community approach beyond that of parent and child populations ought to be considered.},

Intervention sessions were held weekly, and included visual and hands-on demonstration materials and free protection supplies. Knowledge scores on protection methods improved over the course of the study, and 56\% of respondents reported having tried the female condom at least once. The intervention was very highly rated, with the best-liked aspect (50\%) being the group process. Women of African or French territories' origin rated the female condom more positively than women born in continental France or Europe. Evidence suggests that the approach used is feasible and well-liked by women of diverse cultural backgrounds in south-eastern France. Longer follow-up is required to assess behavioural change.},

Data were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire completed by 200 people and from two telephone surveys of Latino men and women living in the Washington, DC area. Analyses included gender and age group comparisons of overall satisfaction with the charlas, diffusion of information from charlas and printed materials, participants' adoption of heart-healthy behaviors, and consumer satisfaction with the radio program and printed educational materials. Few gender and age differences were found and results showed that participants were satisfied with the charlas and the radio program. Between 54\% and 87\% of charla respondents reported sharing printed educational materials with others. The average number of bilingual booklets read by different gender and age groups was between four and five.

	abstract = {Downloadable! African-Americans and Latinos make up about 60\% of Chicago's population. This research looks at how these groups view local TV news coverage of their communities. A random telephone survey of 340 blacks and bilingual Latinos reveals that only 35\% think their race or ethnic group is accurately portrayed on local TV news. They rate local news as "good" in general, but say it does only a "fair" job of covering their ethnic community. The most common complaint, brought up by more than half the blacks and nearly one-third of the Latinos is that TV news focuses on the bad things in their community and rarely reports the good. African-Americans are three times more likely than Latinos to say local TV news hurts race relations in the city, though the largest number said it makes no difference. The two groups watch about the same amount of local TV news, averaging 5.6 days a week. African-Americans are significantly more likely than Latinos to have a favorite anchor and show a strong preference for black anchors. While 80\% of the Latinos surveyed also watch Spanish-language local TV news, they watch it less often than English-language stations. Main Report Methdology Appendix},

Ninety-two Spanish-English bilingual children between 37.65 and 71.87 months (42 male) participated in Study 1 and with 79 of the children aged 48- to 72-months (40 male) also participating in study 2.

	abstract = {Downloadable! Purpose Drawing on B2B Relationship Marketing and management theory, this research seeks to better understand customer-perceived value in B2B contexts, specifically what customers expect from their relationships with suppliers. The study therefore aims to explore the customerâs perspective of the key attributes of relationships, in the software sector, and with specific reference to SMEs in this sector.Design/Method/Approach A two level analysis of customer perspectives on relationship attributes was conducted. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the customers of two case study firms. This process was used both to identify key attributes, and to generate insights into the nature and importance of those attributes. Using these attributes, a second study was conducted; a survey based on an online questionnaire generated data that was analysed using Adaptive Conjoint Analysis in order to identify the relative significance of the attributes. Findings A new Customer Relationship Attributes Model (CRAM) is presented which encapsulates the major attributes customers consider when entering into a relationship with their software supplier. The CRAM identifies five product-related attributes (price, functionality, bilingual capability, location, and software quality), and seven service related attributes (communication, understanding of the customer, trust, relationship, service, professionalism, and employee expertise). The most important of these attributes are: software quality, professionalism, understanding of the customer, and functionality. Originality/value Too much of the research and rhetoric on relationship marketing and management takes a provider side approach. This paper contributes to theory by offering a customer perspective on business relationships in a specific sector. Further, the CRAM can be used by software SMEs to inform the actions that they need to take in order to enhance their relationships with their customers in pursuit of improved business performance.},

	abstract = {Purpose 

To develop a reliable and valid questionnaire of bilingual language status with predictable relationships between self-reported and behavioral measures.

Method 

In Study 1, the internal validity of the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) was established on the basis of self-reported data from 52 multilingual adult participants. In Study 2, criterion-based validity was established on the basis of standardized language tests and self-reported measures from 50 adult SpanishâEnglish bilinguals. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire were established on healthy adults whose literacy levels were equivalent to that of someone with a high school education or higher.

Results 

Factor analyses revealed consistent factors across both studies and suggested that the LEAP-Q was internally valid. Multiple regression and correlation analyses established criterion-based validity and suggested that self-reports were reliable indicators of language performance. Self-reported reading proficiency was a more accurate predictor of first-language performance, and self-reported speaking proficiency was a more accurate predictor of second-language performance. Although global measures of self-reported proficiency were generally predictive of language ability, deriving a precise estimate of performance on a particular task required that specific aspects of language history be taken into account.

Conclusion 

The LEAP-Q is a valid, reliable, and efficient tool for assessing the language profiles of multilingual, neurologically intact adult populations in research settings.},

	abstract = {In bilingual communities, individuals often communicate in one of their languages only, and they adjust to the linguistic background of different interlocutors with ease. What facilitates such efficiency? We investigated whether bilingualsâ language activation is supported by non-linguistic cues (e.g., interlocutor identity). First, in an audioâvisual task, early (proficient) and late (less proficient) BasqueâSpanish bilinguals were familiarized with six novel interlocutors who spoke either Spanish, Basque, or both languages. Then, participants completed an audioâvisual lexical decision task, in which the interlocutors produced test items in Spanish or Basque. Early, but not late, bilingualsâ speed of processing decreased when the language that the interlocutors spoke during familiarization matched the language they spoke at test, relative to test trials when the interlocutors changed languages. Overall, results suggest that proficient and/or early bilinguals benefit from an association between language and interlocutor during (or even before) language comprehension, because they are able to predict the context-appropriate language based on non-linguistic cues, such as interlocutor context.},

The current York Adult Assessment-Revised (YAA-R) is an assessment battery consisting of tests of reading, spelling, writing and phonological skills. Data from a normative sample of 106 adults without dyslexia and a validation sample of 20 adults with dyslexia illustrate significant group differences on the tests comprising the YAA-R. Additionally, the YAA-R has good discriminatory power yielding 80\% sensitivity and 97\% specificity. Taken together, the YAA-R is a suitable test battery for the assessment and identification of dyslexia in university students.},

For instance, the English Lexicon Project (Balota et al., 2007) provides researchers with access to naming and lexical-decision latencies for over 40,000 words. In the present work, we extended the megastudy approach to a task that emphasizes semantic processing. Using a concrete/abstract semantic decision (i.e., does the word refer to something concrete or abstract?), we collected decision latencies and accuracy rates for 10,000 English words. The stimuli were concrete and abstract words selected from Brysbaert, Warriner, and Kupermanâs (2013) comprehensive list of concreteness ratings. In total, 321 participants provided responses to 1,000 words each. Whereas semantic effects tend to be quite modest in naming and lexical decision studies, analyses of the concrete/abstract semantic decision responses show that a substantial proportion of variance can be explained by semantic variables. The item-level and trial-level data will be useful for other researchers interested in the semantic processing of concrete and abstract words.},

Behavioural control of motor impulses was modulated positively through increased bilingual exposure, irrespective of diagnostic status, but bilingual exposure did not significantly affect inhibition involving visual attention. The results partially support the hypothesis that bilingual exposure differentially affects components of inhibitory control and provides important evidence for families that bilingualism is not detrimental to their development.

	abstract = {Autism is described as a lifelong neurodevelopmental spectrum condition, with each
individual varying in their abilities across social and cognitive domains. The current
prevalence estimates range between 1/100 and 1/132 worldwide. Autism is characterized by a
complex collection of manifestations, with repetitive behaviours, social communication
difficulties, and sensory hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity.
 There is evidence to suggest that certain executive function (EF) skills (a group of
important thinking skills that allow individuals to set and complete goals) are impaired in
autistic children. These include interference control (the ability to resist distracting
information), flexible switching (the ability to switch between thoughts and adapt behaviour
according to a changing environment) and sustained attention (the ability to focus over a
period of time). Furthermore, impairments in these EF domains have been evidenced to
underlie some of the key characteristics of autism and negatively impact quality of life.
 There is also evidence to suggest that knowledge of two languages (i.e., bilingualism; a
skill shared by more than half of the worldâs population, comprising an extensive spectrum of
language experiences and markers) has the potential to ameliorate these EF domains. This
evidence is surrounded by debate, however, with evidence for and against a bilingual
advantage. Nevertheless, bilingual disadvantages in EF domains are rarely, if ever, in
evidence. Despite this, there are parent and practitioner concerns with respect to raising
autistic children speaking more than one language. This raises the question: what kind of
impact does bilingualism have on the EF abilities of autistic children? Could bilingualism
mitigate potential EF difficulties in autistic children? Well, only a handful of studies
worldwide have explored this question, all of which strongly support the idea that
bilingualism is not harmful to autistic childrenâs EF development, and may even confer some
advantages. Nevertheless, our understanding of the EF profiles of bilingual autistic children
remains very limited.
 Given the rising diagnostic rates of autism and increases in the worldwide bilingual
population, it is imperative to chart the effects of bilingualism on autism, especially in a
domain evidenced to impact quality of life like EF. This doctoral research explores the effects
of bilingualism on a group of EF skills selected based on their theoretical relevance to
bilingualism (i.e., the Adaptive Control Hypothesis) and autism (the Executive Dysfunction
Theory). All data were collected in the United Arab Emirates, a country that offers a
3
predominantly dual-language switching environment (i.e., using two languages in the same
context), which is also of theoretical relevance to bilingualism.
 Using directly-assessed, experimental measures of EF, findings from the first
investigation (Chapter 3) with 93 participants (autistic and typically developing), revealed an
advantage for bilingual autistic children on one outcome measure of sustained attention and
equivalent performance to monolingual autistic children on all other EF outcome measures.
The findings from this investigation, however, reflect EF performance using laboratory-type
tasks, assessed at one point in time. This is at best, a partial picture of EF, bilingualism and
autism.
 Therefore, I then asked, what is the impact of bilingualism on EF if the measures
deployed capture a wider time span and everyday types of situations? To address this
knowledge gap, I launched the second investigation (Chapter 4) with 80 participants (autistic
and typically developing) using informant-report measures of EF, capturing both parent and
teacher perspectives on childrenâs abilities. The first key finding is that parent-reported EF
revealed an advantage for bilingual autistic children on all EF domains, relative to
monolingual autistic peers. The second key finding is that second language proficiency
predicted parent-reported sustained attention, and second language current exposure
predicted parent-reported interference control. The third key finding is that poorer parentreported EF abilities were associated with more clinically significant features of autism.
 Given the known heterogeneity between autistic children, my third and final
investigation (Chapter 5) went on to examine variability in my data in more detail, using a
multiple case series approach to analyse EF data from 27 autistic participants. The first key
finding was that the individual experience of autism seemed to shape EF capabilities. To
illustrate, in contrast to group-level findings (Chapters 3 and 4) which framed autistic group
performance as âimpairedâ, a multiple case series analysis showed that the majority of autistic
participants performed equivalently to typically developing peers. The second key finding is
that I found no support for âspikyâ autistic EF profiles (i.e., one that has a mix of enhanced,
impaired, and average performance). The third key finding was that more strengths were
revealed on directly-assessed EF than parent-reported EF, which was, in turn, more positive
than teacher-reported EF.
 To my knowledge, this is the first investigation at this interface to use a
multidimensional EF approach â EF was assessed via a combination of direct and informantbased (parent and teacher reports) measures â and to employ mixed analytic methods (i.e.,
group and multiple case series analysis). Further new contributions come from the inclusion
4
of sustained attention as a relevant domain of interest. Additionally, this work contributes to
the diversification of autism research samples beyond WEIRD (western, educated, industrial,
rich, and democratic) samples. Finally, this work contributes new findings from the targeted
investigation of the Adaptive Control Hypothesis theoretical model in a non-typical
population. In the final chapter (Chapter 6), the overall findings of the study are discussed, to
draw conclusions, identify evidence-based implications for families, practitioners,
researchers, and chart new areas of bilingualism research in childhood autism.},

Narratives were collected from 44 bilingual children (14 with DLD), ages 5;7-6;6, using a story retelling procedure. The narrative coding system targeted ratios of the following disfluencies (per C-unit): silent pauses, repetitions, self-corrections, and filled pauses. Silent pauses longer than 0.25 sec were identified using PRAAT softwareÂ© and were classified according to the following durations: more than 0.5 sec, 1 sec, 1.5 sec, and 2 sec. In addition, the loci of pauses (utterance-initial or utterance-internal) and repetitions (content or function words) were coded. Overall, children with DLD and TLD had comparable rates of disfluencies but differed for pauses longer than 0.5 sec and repetition of content words in both languages. For the overall ratio of pauses (more than 0.25 sec), children with and without DLD had more pauses in Russian. Long pauses and repetition of content words reflect difficulties for bilingual children with DLD in dealing with the demands of storytelling, in particular planning processes. A higher ratio of pauses in Russian suggests that they reflect lower proficiency in that language.},

In bilingual development, we consider the impact of bilingual exposure variables on the development of each language. We further explore crosslinguistic influence, that is, the influence of the two languages on each other and how the same bilingual exposure variables impact crosslinguistic influence. For neurotypical children, bilingual variables such as age of onset of bilingualism (AOB) and length of exposure (LOE) were found to have a major impact on linguistic outcomes in both languages (for an overview see Armon-Lotem \& Meir, 2019; Unsworth, 2014). Yet, as pointed out by P\&T, less is known for bilingual children with DLD and even less for children with ASD. This is of a special interest as we can only measure the exposure but not the intake, that is, not what children do with the input they receive. The cases mentioned in P \& T of learning a second language in the absence of communication, on the one hand, and of Arabic speaking children with ASD using the standard rather than the spoken variety, further highlight this dissociation between input and intake, and eventually output. We address this challenge, and bring evidence for the differential impact of exposure for children with DLD and ASD when compared with what we know for neurotypical children. And as is expected for bilingual children, we shall address both languages to see if different patterns are observed for each language.},

	abstract = {Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show heterogeneous language profiles beyond early language delays. Understanding the second language profiles of bilingual children with ASD is important for clinical practice in diverse societies. Accordingly, we examined the narrative abilities of bilinguals with ASD, with developmental language disorder (DLD), and with typical development (TD) to determine which narrative components best differentiate bilinguals with ASD from the other groups. Participants were 29 bilingual children with ASD, DLD, and TD who were matched for age (mean = 6;8), nonverbal intelligence, and receptive vocabulary. Narratives were coded for macrostructure (story grammar (SG) scores, number of individual SG components) and microstructure (syntactic complexity, mean length of utterance, lexical diversity, and story length). The TD group had superior SG scores, included more SG components, and used longer utterances and more complex syntax than the ASD group, whereas no differences were found between the clinical groups. For SG components requiring perspective-taking abilities, the ASD group had worse performance than the TD and DLD groups. Our results suggest that bilingual children with ASD show weaknesses in both macrostructure and microstructure, which can overlap with children with DLD. The linguistic profiles of bilingual children with ASD and DLD are thus both overlapping and distinct. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Bilingual children are both over- and under-identified with developmental language disorder (DLD). We propose that this may be a function of monolingual approaches that fail to consider the dynamic nature of bilingualism as well as assumptions of bilingual delay. We explored the extent to which bilingual children with and without DLD demonstrated mixed dominance as a function of exposure to English. We document patterns of performance in bilingual children with and without DLD on the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment or Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment-Middle Extension in Spanish, English, and their best language scores., METHOD: A total of 595 (100 with DLD) Spanish-English bilingual children between the ages of 5 and 12 years were included in the analyses. We employed logistic regression to evaluate the probability of demonstrating mixed dominance across semantics and morphosyntax in Spanish and English by ability status. We then evaluated the association between English exposure and performance in Spanish, English, and the best language on semantics and morphosyntax measures., RESULTS: There were similar typically developing and DLD probabilities of Spanish or English dominance associated with high degrees of Spanish and English exposure. Mixed dominance was associated with both ability and exposure. Children with DLD demonstrated more mixed dominance from 0\% to 60\% English exposure. The patterns of mixed dominance were similar by ability when they had more than 60\% exposure to English. There were significant associations between single language testing in Spanish and English with percentage of exposure for children with and without DLD. When the best score (comparing English and Spanish) was used, there were no significant associations with exposure for semantics or morphosyntax., CONCLUSIONS: These results inform researchers and clinicians about the nature of bilingual proficiency in children with and without DLD. Mixed dominance was observed in both groups but with different patterns at lower levels of English exposure in children with and without DLD. We also see that when children's best score is considered, all differences in performance along the bilingual continuum are related to ability not language exposure. This has implications for how to consider children's language test scores in making clinical decisions about bilingual children. Presentation Video: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23929470.},

	abstract = {Function words and, more specifically, articles have been widely indicated as one of the main sources of difficulty for children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). The present study is the first to assess the online comprehension of Spanish articles in bilingual children with DLD. In an eye tracking experiment, we monitored participants' eye movements as they listened to Spanish articles embedded in structurally simple sentences. Ninety-six subjects from four different groups were evaluated: 24 children with DLD (average age 7;08), 24 children with the same chronological age (average age 7;08), 24 younger children matched for mean length utterance (average age 6;08), and 24 adults (average age 22;05).

Our results suggest that children with DLD are capable of timely comprehension of Spanish articles in real time and within simple sentence structures. However, we observed a strong effect of chronological age in the sample of interest; younger children with DLD are able to identify the correct referent, but this preference is weaker compared to the older children with DLD. We also observed local differences between the DLD group, and the other two children control groups, particularly when the chronological age group is introduced as a factor. These findings suggest a developmental trajectory that is different in the DLD group relative to children with typical language development. Notwithstanding, in spite of the article production difficulties previously reported, children with DLD in the present sample appear to be able to comprehend Spanish articles in the current experimental conditions.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the frequency, direction, and structural characteristics of code-switching (CS) during narratives by Spanish-English bilingual children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD) to determine whether children with DLD exhibit unique features in their CS that may inform clinical decision-making., METHOD: Spanish-English bilingual children, aged 4;0-6;11 (years;months), with DLD (n = 33) and with typical language development (TLD; n = 33) participated in narrative retell and story generation tasks in Spanish and English. Instances of CS were classified as between utterance or within utterance; within-utterance CS was coded for type of grammatical structure. Children completed the morphosyntax subtests of the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment to assist in identifying DLD and to index Spanish and English morphosyntactic proficiency., RESULTS: In analyses examining the contributions of both DLD status and Spanish and English proficiency, the only significant effect of DLD was on the tendency to engage in between-utterance CS; children with DLD were more likely than TLD peers to produce whole utterances in English during the Spanish narrative task. Within-utterance CS was related to lower morphosyntax scores in the target language, but there was no effect of DLD. Both groups exhibited noun insertions as the most frequent type of within-utterance CS. However, children with DLD tended to exhibit more determiner and verb insertions than TLD peers and increased use of "congruent lexicalization," that is, CS utterances that integrate content and function words from both languages., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce that use of CS, particularly within-utterance CS, is a typical bilingual behavior even during narrative samples collected in a single-language context. However, language difficulties associated with DLD may emerge in how children code-switch, including use of between-utterance CS and unique patterns during within-utterance CS. Therefore, analyzing CS patterns may contribute to a more complete profile of children's dual-language skills during assessment., SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23479574.},

However, the relative ease of semantic task completion depends on individual differences in developmental and language experience factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how language experience and language ability impact semantic task difficulty in English for school-age Spanish-English bilingual children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD)., METHOD: Participants included 232 Spanish-English bilingual children in second through fifth grade with (n = 35) and without (n = 197) DLD. Data included children's performance on the English Semantics subtest of the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment-Middle Extension Field Test Version (BESA-ME), age of English acquisition, and percent English language exposure. Task difficulty, a measurement of the relative ease of task completion, was calculated for six semantic task types included on the BESA-ME. Multilevel regression modeling was conducted to estimate longitudinal growth trajectories for each semantic task type., RESULTS: Results showed that language ability and grade level drive semantic task difficulty for all task types, and children with DLD experienced greater difficulty on all task types compared to their typically developing peers. Longitudinally, semantic task difficulty decreased for all children, regardless of language ability, indicating that semantic task types became easier over time. While children made gains on all semantic tasks, the growth rate of task difficulty was not equal across task types, where some task types showed slower growth compared with others. English language exposure emerged as a significant predictor of semantic task difficulty while age of acquisition was not a significant factor., CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies developmental profiles of lexical-semantic performance in bilingual children with and without DLD and supports clinical decision-making regarding children's English language learning.},

To address this gap, we evaluated the relationships between intrinsic factors (age, language ability), extrinsic factors (L1 exposure), and word characteristics (e.g. imageability, concreteness) with item difficulty and expressive vocabulary knowledge in school-aged Spanish-English bilinguals with and without DLD. While we found similar patterns of associations between item difficulty and word characteristics across language ability groups, divergent predictive patterns emerged across languages and across ability groups.

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125131},
	abstract = {Introduction: Mazes are linguistic disfluencies such as filled pauses, repetitions, or revisions of grammatical, phonological, or lexical aspects of words that do not contribute to the meaning of a sentence. Bilingual children are believed to increase the numbers of mazes in their native or heritage language, the minority language, as they become more proficient in the second language, the societal language. Mazes may increase over time in bilingual Spanish-speaking children as they become more proficient in English, the societal language in the United States. However, current studies have not been conducted longitudinally. Higher rates of mazes in the heritage language over time may be due to changes in language proficiency and differences in processing demands in the children as they use more complex language. Moreover, children with developmental language disorder (DLD) can also present higher rates of mazes than children with typical language. Heritage speakers, therefore, are at risk of being misdiagnosed with DLD due to high rates of mazes. Currently, we do not understand what the typical rates of mazes are as heritage speakers get older and become more proficient in the societal language. The current study examined the type and frequency of Spanish mazes longitudinally in a group of 22 Spanish heritage speakers with and without DLD and determined the changes over time., Methods: A total of 11 children with typical language development (TLD) and 11 with DLD participated in this 5-year longitudinal study. Using a wordless picture book, children completed a retelling task in Spanish during the spring of each academic year (PK to 3rd grade) as part of a 5-h testing battery. Narratives were transcribed and coded for types of mazes (filled pauses, repetitions, grammatical revisions, phonological revisions, and lexical revisions)., Results and conclusion: The results of the study indicate that TLD children increased their overall percentage of mazed words and utterances. The opposite pattern was observed in the DLD group, which decreased their percentage of mazed words and utterances. In contrast, both groups demonstrated a decrease in repetitions in first grade and an increase in third grade. Additionally, the TLD and DLD children decreased in the percentage of fillers in first grade and then increased in the third grade. Results suggest that maze use is quite variable in heritage speakers and does not necessarily differentiate groups. Clinicians should not rely solely on mazes to determine ability status. In fact, high use of mazes can reflect typical language development. Copyright Â© 2023 Martinez-Nieto, Moen, Pierce and Restrepo.},

Regression models explored the predictive power of motor skills with Spanish and English language ability as the outcome measure., RESULTS: Oral fine motor abilities (diadochokinetic rate productions of /pa/ and /pata/) predicted Spanish (but not English) oral language abilities in the expected direction (i.e., faster rates were associated with better language).

However, the effect of bilingual exposure on more complex linguistic abilities is unknown. In the current study, we examined the impact of amount of language exposure on vocabulary and morphological skills in school-aged children with ASD who did not have intellectual disability. Forty-seven typically developing children and 30 children with ASD with varying exposure to French participated in the study. We investigated the impact of amount of language exposure, nonverbal IQ, age, and working memory on language abilities via regression analyses. Current amount of language exposure was the strongest predictor of both vocabulary skills (accounting for 62\% of the variance) and morphological skills (accounting for 49\% of the variance), for both typically-developing children and children with ASD. These findings highlight the central role amount of language exposure plays in vocabulary and morphological development for children with ASD, as it does for typically-developing children.

Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) lack in their abilities in both tasks compared with children with TLD. The current study tested the interplay between bilingualism and language disorder during novel word learning and lexical retrieval. Preschoolers (N = 101; 50 boys and 51 girls; mothers' mean years of education = 16.35) in four groups (Hebrew monolinguals or Russian-Hebrew bilinguals with DLD or TLD) learned 12 novel real words (6 with a familiar referent and 6 with a novel referent) and performed a lexical retrieval task. Children exhibited significant learning with no effect of bilingualism, but a negative effect of language disorder. Thus, children with DLD performed worse than children with TLD, and this ability was not affected by bilingualism. In lexical retrieval, DLD groups scored lower than TLD groups, and critically also bilinguals scored lower than monolinguals. This differential effect of bilingualism in the two tasks suggests that bilingualism does not impede language learning mechanisms even among children with DLD. Instead, the findings suggest that lower performance in the lexical retrieval task is due to decreased frequency of exposure. By exploring both word learning and lexical retrieval, the study highlights the differential mechanisms at play in the effects of bilingualism and language disorder on the developing lexicon.

	abstract = {LAY ABSTRACT: Previous research has suggested that bilingualism may improve cognition in children with autism, and that this boost may stem from improvement in executive functions. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children are considered to be reliable and valid measures of intelligence when administered to autistic children. These measures have so far revealed unusual psychometric properties in monolingual autistic children, notably distinctive patterns of strengths and weaknesses and low inter-correlation among verbal and nonverbal IQ subtests. The way bilingualism affects the intellectual functioning of autistic children has not been explored yet. Nor has there been a satisfactory factor structure that explains monolingual and bilingual autistic children's IQ performance in terms of individual factors, such as age and socioeconomic status. The current study examined the intelligence profiles of 316 bilingual and age- and gender-matched monolingual children with autism using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Third Edition. The study applied clustering models to extract intelligence subtypes of autism, and mediation analyses to examine potential mediation effects of age and socioeconomic status on the children's verbal and nonverbal IQ performance. The results support the mediational role of the children's socioeconomic status in the association between bilingualism and intelligence. Low-socioeconomic status bilingual autistic children outperformed their monolingual peers on both verbal and nonverbal subtests, while the differences faded in medium-socioeconomic status and high-socioeconomic status children. The findings emphasize the positive effects of bilingualism on low-socioeconomic status autistic children's intelligence and also highlight high-socioeconomic status as a factor that may mitigate discrepant patterns of strengths and weaknesses in monolingual children's IQ performance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing body of work shows that children with developmental language disorder (DLD) perform poorly on statistical word learning (SWL) tasks, consistent with the predictions of the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis that predicts that procedural memory is impaired in DLD. To date, however, SWL performance has not been compared across linguistically heterogeneous populations of children with DLD., AIMS: To compare SWL performance in a group of age, sex and non-verbal IQ-matched Catalan-Spanish and English-speaking children with and without DLD., METHODS \& PROCEDURES: Two cohorts of children: (1) 35 Catalan-Spanish-speaking children with DLD (Mage = 8;7 years) and 35 age/sex-matched typical developing (TD) children (Mage = 8;9 years), and (2) 24 English-speaking children with DLD (Mage = 9;1 years) and 19 age/sex matched TD controls (Mage = 8;9 years) completed the tone version of a SWL task from Evans et al. (2009). Children listened to a tone language in which transitional probabilities within tone words were higher than those between words., OUTCOMES \& RESULTS: For both Catalan-Spanish and English cohorts, overall performance for the children with DLD was poorer than that of the TD controls regardless of the child's native language. Item analysis revealed that children with DLD had difficulty tracking statistical information and using transitional probability to discover tone word boundaries within the input. For both the Catalan-Spanish and English-speaking children, SWL accounted for a significant amount of unique variance in Receptive and Expressive vocabulary. Likelihood ratio analysis revealed that for both Catalan-Spanish and English cohorts, children having performance {\textless}= 45\% on the SWL task had an extremely high degree of likelihood of having DLD. The analysis also revealed that for the Catalan-Spanish and English-speaking children, scores of {\textgreater}= 75\% and {\textgreater}= 70\%, respectively, were highly likelihood to be children with normal language abilities., CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: The findings add to a pattern suggesting that SWL is a mechanism that children rely on to acquire vocabulary. The results also suggest that SWL deficits, in particular when combined with other measures, may be a reliable diagnostic indicator for children with DLD regardless of the child's native language, and whether or not the child is bilingual or monolingual., WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Although there is some disagreement, a small but growing body of work suggests that deficits in procedural memory, as measured either by motor sequencing (Serial Reaction Time-SRT) or SWL tasks, may be part of the deficit profile of children with DLD. To date, studies have not examined SWL across linguistically heterogeneous populations of children with DLD to determine if it is a unique clinical marker of the disorder. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The results show that children with DLD, regardless of their native language, or whether the child is bi- or monolingual, have difficulties on SWL tasks, and that these deficits are linked to severity of the language disorder. Taken together, these results indicate that procedural memory deficits may be a core feature of DLD. This suggests that statistical-learning tasks using tone stimuli can also advance our understanding of statistical-learning abilities in children with DLD more globally. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The current study shows that statistical-learning tasks using tone stimuli can be used in conjunction with standardized assessment measures to differentiate children with DLD from children with typical language ability.

	abstract = {The prevalence of autism worldwide has risen steadily in the last two decades, while bilingualism is also becoming increasingly prevalent in today's rapidly globalizing world. The current study aimed to investigate bilingualism effects in the pronoun resolution skills of children with autism in comparison to age-matched monolingual children with autism, as well as monolingual and bilingual children of typical development (Nu = 20 participants per group). Results showed that autistic children had general difficulty anchoring ambiguous pronouns to entities that were linguistically expressed in discourse, yet, the bilingual children with autism were more sensitive to the topicality of the entities in syntactic subject position and more prone to identify them as suitable referents of ambiguous null pronouns as compared to their monolingual peers. The findings suggest that bilingualism is not detrimental to autistic children's pronoun resolution skills. The current study aimed at determining how bilingualism influences ambiguous pronoun comprehension in children with autism as compared to bilingual and monolingual children of typical development. The findings show that bilingualism was not detrimental to the autistic children's pronoun resolution skills, further suggesting that having acquired more than one language does not exacerbate autistic children's deficits in the comprehension of pronouns.

DLD is associated with slower processing speed, but the extent to which slowing extends to bilingual populations is not established. The possible presence of bilingual cognitive effects could also lead to faster processing speed among bilingual children. Method Participants included 108 children of ages 6-8 years, including 56 Spanish-English bilinguals (29 with DLD and 27 with typical development) and 52 English-only monolinguals (25 with DLD and 27 with typical development). Language testing (in both languages for bilingual children) was combined with parent and school report to classify children as having DLD or typical language development. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were excluded from the sample. Reaction time from a choice visual detection task was used to index nonverbal processing speed. Results Children with DLD demonstrated slower processing speed than their typically developing peers, whereas bilingual children demonstrated faster processing speed than monolinguals. The effects of DLD and bilingualism did not interact. Conclusions This study replicates prior findings of slowed processing speed among children with DLD in both monolingual and bilingual children. Evidence of faster processing speed among bilingual children contributes to the complex literature surrounding the circumstances of bilingual cognitive effects.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Given that children with Down syndrome (DS) have language learning difficulties, concerns have been raised about the capacity of these children to acquire two (or more) languages. This research examines the language profiles of bilingual children with DS and typically developing (TD) children in comparison to monolinguals, with a view towards identifying the factors associated with language abilities within these populations., METHOD: Four groups of children were recruited: Welsh-English bilinguals with DS (n=10), English monolinguals with DS (n=10), TD Welsh-English bilinguals (n=10) and TD English monolinguals (n=10). Children were individually matched on nonverbal cognitive ability (NVCA) to each child in the bilingual DS group and the four groups were matched on socioeconomic status and gender. Bilinguals were matched on current and lifetime exposure to Welsh and age of first exposure to their L2. Within DS and TD groups, chronological age was statistically controlled for. Language abilities were assessed via standardised assessments and specially designed tasks. Bilinguals were assessed in both of their languages., RESULTS: Results show no effect of language status on measures of expressive and receptive language abilities or phonological awareness. Language impairments were evident for both DS groups, particularly for expressive morphosyntax. Welsh receptive vocabulary scores of the bilinguals with DS were comparable to the TD bilinguals. Working memory, phonological awareness and chronological age were the strongest predictors of receptive language outcomes in both DS groups, explaining 90\% of the variability., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we report no adverse outcomes on language development for bilinguals with DS. To our knowledge, this is the first group study of bilingualism in children with DS within the UK. Findings align with and add to the growing body of literature that reports that bilingualism does not negatively impact the language development of children with developmental disabilities.

	volume = {14},
	doi = {10.1002/aur.2542},
	abstract = {This study examined whether bilingualism boosts Theory of Mind as measured by a non-verbal false belief (FB) task in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and how this potential boost may stem from improvements in a variety of other domains, namely executive functions (EFs), language, metalinguistic awareness skills, as well as autism severity. One hundred and three children with ASD (7- to 15-year-olds) (43 bilingual and 60 age- and IQ-matched monolingual children) were tested on a nonverbal task of attentional switching, working memory and updating task, and an online, low-verbal first-order FB task. Results showed a clear FB benefit for bilingual children with ASD as compared with their monolingual peers. There were also boosts in EF, however, there is no evidence that these EF boosts drove the FB advantage. Enhanced FB was not explained either by language, metalinguistic skills, or lower autism severity. While the results do not conclusively settle the debate on what triggers the ToM advantage in bilingual children with ASD, the empirical picture of the current study suggests that the ToM component of FB understanding in bilingual children with ASD is enhanced by the bilingual experience per se. LAY SUMMARY: The current study aimed to determine if and how bilingualism may improve the ability to understand others' beliefs in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We assessed their belief reasoning alongside a series of other skills hypothesized to be beneficial for such reasoning, namely understanding, producing, and thinking about language, recalling and switching between information, and the severity of their autistic symptoms. The overall findings highlight advantages for bilingual children with ASD over their monolingual peers for grasping beliefs, thus suggesting that pursuing bilingualism may be beneficial for cognition in ASD. Other boosts were also associated with bilingualism, such as recalling and switching between information, but these boosts were not directly related to belief understanding, highlighting the beneficial role of bilingualism per se.

	abstract = {There is evidence to suggest that certain executive functions are impaired in autistic children, contributing to many daily challenges. Regular use of two languages has the potential to positively influence executive functions, though evidence is mixed. Little is known about the impact of bilingualism on the executive functions of autistic children, with only a handful of studies published worldwide to date. This study investigated the impact of bilingualism on sustained attention, interference control, flexible switching and working memory, in Arabic-English autistic children (n = 27) and their typically developing peers (n = 66), aged 5-12 years old. Groups were matched on age, nonverbal IQ and socioeconomic status, and completed a battery of computerized tests. Results showed an advantage for bilingual autistic children relative to their monolingual peers in sustained attention, and equivalent performance between bilingual and monolingual autistic children on all other executive functions. There were no generalized positive effects of bilingualism, and typically-developing children performed better than autistic children on all measures. The findings indicate that bilingualism does not negatively impact the executive function skills of autistic children, and that it might mitigate difficulties in sustained attention. LAY SUMMARY: Contrary to widespread belief, but in line with previous research, this study showed that speaking two languages did not harm thinking skills in autistic children. The thinking skills evaluated in this study included the ability to focus over a period of time, the ability to resist distractions, the ability to move back and forth between tasks, and the ability to use short-term memory. In fact, speaking two languages might help reduce difficulties that autistic children might face when focusing over a period of time.

Bilingualism did not moderate the association between attention problems and interference control; however, across all children, those with higher levels of attention problems had more difficulty with interference control. Monolingual children demonstrated advantages in verbal fluency relative to bilingual children, but this did not vary with attention problems.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children's executive functioning (EF) is often negatively associated with a developmental language disorder (DLD) and positively related to bilingualism. However, both regarding children with DLD and bilingual children, findings are mixed and few studies have investigated the combination of DLD and bilingualism in relation to EF., AIMS: This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on children's EF development., METHODS: Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical development (TD; N = 32 in each group) were tested three times with yearly intervals (MAGE = 71 months at time 1). Verbal and visuospatial working memory, selective attention, and inhibition were assessed., RESULTS: Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to TD peers, which could partly be explained by verbal short-term memory limitations. Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and morphology skills, and were most pronounced at time 1., CONCLUSIONS: Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits, which are partly secondary to verbal short-term memory weaknesses. Bilinguals performed better on EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for. This effect was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 5-6 years.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jcomdis.2020.106027},
	abstract = {Function words and, more specifically, articles have been widely indicated as one of the main sources of difficulty for children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). The present study is the first to assess the online comprehension of Spanish articles in bilingual children with DLD. In an eye tracking experiment, we monitored participants' eye movements as they listened to Spanish articles embedded in structurally simple sentences. Ninety-six subjects from four different groups were evaluated: 24 children with DLD (average age 7;08), 24 children with the same chronological age (average age 7;08), 24 younger children matched for mean length utterance (average age 6;08), and 24 adults (average age 22;05). We calculated the proportion between the preference for the correct visual referent and a competitor object. Our results suggest that children with DLD are capable of timely comprehension of Spanish articles in real time and within simple sentence structures. However, we observed a strong effect of chronological age in the sample of interest; younger children with DLD are able to identify the correct referent, but this preference is weaker compared to the older children with DLD. We also observed local differences between the DLD group, and the other two children control groups, particularly when the chronological age group is introduced as a factor. These findings suggest a developmental trajectory that is different in the DLD group relative to children with typical language development. Notwithstanding, in spite of the article production difficulties previously reported, children with DLD in the present sample appear to be able to comprehend Spanish articles in the current experimental conditions.

	abstract = {While there is ample evidence that monolingual children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) face difficulties with narrative story-telling and executive functions (EF), there is considerable uncertainty about how bilingualism impacts these skills in autism. The current study explores the effect of bilingualism on the narrative and EF skills of forty 7-to-12-year-old bilingual and monolingual children with ASD, as well as forty age-matched bilingual and monolingual children of typical development (TD). Narrative production data were elicited using the Edmonton Narrative Norms Instrument (ENNI; Schneider et al., 2005), which was developed to measure narrative production at a microstructural and macrostructural level. The same children were administered two EF tasks, namely, a global-local visual attention task and a 2-back working memory task. In story-telling, bilingual children with ASD achieved higher scores than monolingual children with ASD on story structure complexity and use of adverbial clauses, and they tended to use significantly fewer ambiguous referential forms than their monolingual peers with ASD. In the global-local task, bilingual children with ASD were faster and more accurate in global trials than monolingual children with ASD, who tended to be more susceptible to interference from locally presented information than the other experimental groups. Higher accuracy and faster response times were also observed for bilingual children with ASD in the 2-back task. Further correlation analyses between the story-telling and EF tasks revealed that bilingual children with ASD drew on a broader range of EF in narrative production than their monolingual peers. The overall findings reveal that bilingual children with ASD outperformed their monolingual peers with ASD in both the microstructure and macrostructure of their narrative production, as well as in their visual attention and working memory skills.

TD children (35 monolinguals, 24 bilinguals) and children with DLD (17 monolinguals, 10 bilinguals) completed a visual choice reaction time task. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Expressive Vocabulary Test were used as language measures. Results The children with DLD exhibited slower response times relative to TD children. Response time was not modified by bilingual experience, neither in children with typical development nor children with DLD. Also, we found that faster processing speed was related to higher language abilities, but this relationship was not significant when socioeconomic status was controlled for. The magnitude of the association did not differ between the monolingual and bilingual groups across the language measures. Conclusions Slower processing speed is related to lower language abilities in children. Processing speed is minimally influenced by dual language experience, at least within this age range.

Twenty-eight bilingual adolescents with and without DLD in typical schools were followed from childhood to adolescence. At age five, language and cognitive variables were assessed. In addition, language, behavior, emotional and school adjustment, and socioeconomic and family aspects were evaluated at age 12. Results reveal that adolescents with DLD show poorer school adjustment and less adaptive skills when evaluated by their tutors, and a larger index of emotional problems when self-assessed. Moreover, family involvement, but not socioeconomic status (SES), emerged as a protective factor since it was related to behavioral, emotional, and school adjustment, a result that was further confirmed by structural equation modeling. Therefore, a more global approach involving individuals, schools and families is needed to provide adolescents with DLD adequate support.

Language Z-scores were generated based on a contemporaneous term-born control group. A selection of biological factors (sex, small for gestational age, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infection, and qualitatively defined brain injury) and early socioenvironmental factors at age 2 years (primary income earner employment status and type, primary caregiver education level, English as a second language, parental mental health history, parent sensitivity and facilitation, and parent-child synchrony) was chosen a priori. Associations were assessed using univariable and multivariable linear regression models applied to outcomes at each time point., RESULTS: Higher primary caregiver education level, greater parent-child synchrony, and parent sensitivity were independently associated with better language function across childhood. Socioenvironmental factors together explained an increasing percentage of the variance (9\%-18\%) in language function from 2 to 13 years of age. In comparison, there was little evidence for associations between biological factors and language function, even during early childhood years., CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of socioenvironmental factors over biological factors for language development throughout childhood. Some of these socioenvironmental factors are potentially modifiable, and parent-based interventions addressing parenting practices and education may benefit preterm children's language development.},

More recently, research has begun to address the challenges of identifying and treating Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) in English Language Learners (ELLs). Developmental patterns of DLD are not necessarily consistent over time, and we hypothesized that some monolinguals and ELLs go "under the radar" in lower grades but their language difficulties become more pronounced in later years, as syntactic demands increase, hence "late-emerging DLD". This longitudinal study examined (a) the existence of late-emerging DLD in Grades 4-6 in English-speaking monolinguals and ELLs, and (b) the Grade 1 and 3 cognitive and language profiles that predict late-emerging DLD. This study involved monolinguals (n = 149), and ELLs (n = 402) coming from diverse home language backgrounds. Cognitive (working memory, phonological short-term memory, processing speed), language (vocabulary and syntax), and word reading skills were assessed annually from grades 1 to 6. Separate parallel analyses in the monolingual and ELL samples confirmed that late-emerging DLD exists in both groups. In comparison with their typically developing peers, late-emerging DLD can be identified as early as Grade 1 based on poorer performance on phonological awareness, naming speed, and working memory.},

	abstract = {Purpose Attention and language are hypothesized to interact in bilingual children and in children with developmental language disorder (DLD). In children who are bilingual, attentional control may be enhanced by repeated experience regulating 2 languages. In children with DLD, subtle weaknesses in sustained attention may relate to impaired language processing. This study measured attentional control and sustained attention in monolingual and bilingual children with and without DLD in order to examine the potential influences of bilingualism and DLD, as well as their intersection, on attention. Method Monolingual English-only and bilingual Spanish-English children aged 6-8 years were categorized into participant groups based on eligibility testing and parent interviews. Parent interviews included standardized assessment of language environment and parent concern regarding language. Participants completed 2 nonlinguistic computerized assessments: a flanker task to measure attentional control and a continuous performance task to measure sustained attention. Results One hundred nine children met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in a participant group. Regression models predicting performance on the attention tasks were similar for both sustained attention and attentional control. For both tasks, DLD was a significant predictor, and bilingualism was not. Measuring bilingualism continuously using parent-reported exposure did not alter results. Conclusions This study found no evidence of a "bilingual cognitive advantage" on 2 types of attention among sequential Spanish-English bilingual children but also found a negative effect of DLD that was consistent across both types of attention and both bilingual and monolingual children. Results are consistent with the broader literature on subtle nonlinguistic deficits in children with DLD and suggest these deficits are minimally affected by diverse linguistic experience.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Many studies examining early bilingualism in migrant populations focus on the development of the first language. As language acquisition is closely related to the hearing development, there is a critical need to investigate language development in hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually who were fitted with cochlear implants and/or hearing aids. Therefore, this research project aimed to study the linguistic development of hearing-impaired children being raised with German as a second language who were provided with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, the language development of these children is compared with that of hearing-impaired children being raised in a monolingual environment and with normal-hearing children being raised bilingually., METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed data from 95 typically developing children with hearing loss (43 bilingual and 52 monolingual) aged 3;0 to 10;11 (years; months) on four language measures in German: receptive vocabulary, productive vocabulary, receptive grammar, productive grammar (sentence repetition). Additionally, 30 bilingual children with normal hearing were included in this study., RESULTS: 44 children were provided with hearing aids in both ears; 34 used cochlear implants bilaterally and 17 were fitted bimodally. Statistical analysis showed that bilingual hearing-impaired children scored significantly poorer than monolingual hearing-impaired children., CONCLUSION: Hearing-impaired children being raised bilingually should have speech and language examinations on a regular basis. An examination of both languages would be desirable in order to be able to fully assess speech and language acquisition. Copyright Â© 2019. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bilingual children and children diagnosed with developmental language disorder (DLD) are characterized by reduced lexical-retrieval abilities. Few studies examined their joint contribution and the mechanisms underlying these effects in the lexical domain., AIMS: To explore the joint effects of bilingualism and DLD by adopting a four-group comparison in which the difference between bi- and monolingual children with DLD is directly compared with that of bi- and monolingual children with typical language development (TLD). In addition, to examine the mechanisms underlying the effects of bilingualism and DLD on children's lexical-retrieval abilities, we tested how item's characteristics (frequency of use) modulate the effects of bilingualism and DLD., METHODS \& PROCEDURES: Fifty-eight children (aged 9-14 years) participated in the current study. They were either Hebrew monolingual or Hebrew-English bilinguals and were either diagnosed with DLD or had TLD. Children completed a Hebrew picture-naming task and verbal short-term memory tests. The influence of participants' characteristics, including bilingualism, DLD and verbal short-term memory, as well as item's characteristics (frequency of use) were tested., OUTCOMES \& RESULTS: Accuracy analysis revealed that bilingual children scored lower than monolingual children and that children with DLD scored lower than children with TLD. Critically, the two factors interacted such that their joint presence resulted in less-than-additive effects. Specifically, although bilingual children with DLD performed worse than all other groups, they performed better than expected under an additive model. Interestingly, monolingual children with DLD performed similarly to bilingual children with TLD. Increased verbal short-term memory was associated with better performance across the four groups. Finally, bilingualism and DLD interacted with item frequency, such that being bilingual, having DLD, or both, resulted in increased sensitivity to item frequency manifested in exceptionally lower performance on low-frequency items., CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that the strength of linguistic representations contribute to the effects of bilingualism and DLD. Further, the presence of bilingualism in the context of DLD does not exaggerate the impact of DLD. Clinically, this suggests that differences between bi- and monolingual children with DLD must be considered in reference to the gap in lexical-retrieval performance observed between bi- and monolingual children with TLD. Finally, because monolingual children with DLD and bilingual children with TLD performed similarly, sensitive diagnostic tools and intervention programmes should be adopted to allow correct identification and treatment of bilingual children with DLD.

Results showed an advantage for bilingual relative to monolingual children with ASD on the DCCS task, but not for set-shifting in daily life.

However, the effect of bilingual exposure on more complex linguistic abilities is unknown. In the current study, we examined the impact of amount of language exposure on vocabulary and morphological skills in school-aged children with ASD who did not have intellectual disability. Forty-seven typically developing children and 30 children with ASD with varying exposure to French participated in the study. We investigated the impact of amount of language exposure, nonverbal IQ, age, and working memory on language abilities via regression analyses. Current amount of language exposure was the strongest predictor of both vocabulary skills (accounting for 62\% of the variance) and morphological skills (accounting for 49\% of the variance), for both typically-developing children and children with ASD. These findings highlight the central role amount of language exposure plays in vocabulary and morphological development for children with ASD, as it does for typically-developing children. In addition, they provide further evidence that, when provided with adequate language exposure, many children with ASD are capable of acquiring two languages. Autism Research 2018, 11: 1667-1678.

LAY SUMMARY: We studied typically developing children and children with ASD living in a bilingual society who had varying exposure to French (ranging from bilinguals to monolinguals). We investigated the impact of amount of language exposure, nonverbal IQ, age, and working memory on their vocabulary and morphological skills. Current amount of language exposure was the strongest predictor of language skills in both groups of children. Findings indicate that when provided with adequate language exposure, many children with ASD are capable of acquiring two languages.

	abstract = {This study explores the role of German dative case marking in disentangling effects of specific language impairment (SLI) and bilingualism. Longitudinal data of German-Italian bilingual children with SLI (N=3) is compared to cross-sectional data (N=42) of monolingual and bilingual typically developing (TD) children and monolingual children with SLI (ages four and seven). Spontaneous and elicited speech data is analysed in terms of target-like dative case marking in German. Results show differences between the acquisition of case marking of pronouns and of full Determiner Phrases (DPs). Regarding the target-like dative case marking in total, there were no differences found between bilingual TD, monolingual and bilingual children with SLI by the age of four. They demonstrated a similar delay when compared to monolingual TD children. By the age of seven, however, bilingual TD children 'catch up' with their monolingual peers. Children with SLI do not master the acquisition of dative case marking by this age. Cumulative effects of bilingualism and SLI were not found neither in younger nor in older bilingual children. These findings underline the importance of further research on linguistic markers and of distinguishing between effects of SLI and bilingualism. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Prior to the start of treatment, parents completed several measures about their children's behavior and executive function, and children were administered two subtests of the Automated Working Memory Assessment to examine their current WM capabilities. After controlling for demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, socioeconomic status, IQ, and diagnostic status), no significant differences were observed between bilingual and monolingual children in verbal WM performance (beta=.03, p{\textgreater}.05). However, children who were bilingual did perform better than monolinguals on spatial WM tasks (beta=.23, p{\textless}.01). Finally, parent reports of WM corroborated these findings such that bilingual children were reported as having fewer WM problems by parents (beta=-.19, p{\textless}.05) and teachers (beta=-.22, p{\textless}.05). Whereas WM deficits are often found among children with DBDs, the current findings suggest that bilingualism may serve as a protective factor for preschoolers with DBDs.

To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of language learning in bilingual-exposed (BE) children with ASD., Methods: Participants were 388 children evaluated as part of a larger study on the early detection of ASD. Parents were asked to list all languages that primary caretakers use to communicate with their child. One hundred six BE children (57 ASD, 49 DD) were compared to 282 monolingual-exposed (ME) children (176 ASD, 106 DD). The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assessed nonverbal and verbal abilities. Multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BE to language abilities, beyond the influence of nonverbal cognitive abilities, diagnosis, and socioeconomic status., Results: Results showed greater language impairment in ASD than DD, but no main effect for language exposure group nor any interaction of language group by diagnosis. Results remained consistent after controlling for socioeconomic status., Conclusion: This study suggests that bilingual caregivers can communicate with their children in both languages without adverse effects on their children's language functioning.},

Groups were similar in age, gender and race, but PT children had lower socioeconomic status (SES) than FT children. Parents completed a language questionnaire and diary and a standardized parent rating of EF skills. Children completed EF tasks that tap response inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. ANCOVA and logistic regression examined effects on EF of birth group (PT/FT), language status (M/B), and birth group by language status interaction, controlling for age and SES., RESULTS: Compared to children born FT, children born PT had significantly higher parent-rated EF scores and poorer performance on all but one EF task, both indicating more EF problems. No main effects of language status and no birth group by language status interactions were significant., CONCLUSION: PT status was clearly associated with poorer EF skills, similar to many other studies. In this sample, bilingual exposure conferred neither an advantage nor disadvantage in the FT and PT group. This information may prove useful in counseling families of both PT and FT children about the impact of bilingual exposure on their children's cognitive skills.},

The BLI group increased syntagmatic associations from time 1 to time 2, while the BTD group increased paradigmatic associations. Results showed a significant main effect of Language for both types of associations, with better performance in Swedish. Significant Group by Language interactions resulted from lower Arabic than Swedish syntagmatic and paradigmatic scores for the BLI and BTD groups, respectively., CONCLUSION: Differing developmental trajectories indicate that bilingual children with LI develop lexical organisation at a slower pace than bilingual peers with typical language development.},

At testing the children were enrolled in three different educational settings; in mainstream education, where spoken language is used or in hard-of-hearing education where sign supported spoken language is used and in bilingual deaf education, with Sign Language of the Netherlands and Sign Supported Dutch. Children were assessed on auditory speech perception, receptive language, educational attainment and wellbeing., RESULTS: Auditory speech perception of children with CI in mainstream education enable them to acquire language and educational levels that are comparable to those of their normal hearing peers. Although the children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing settings show similar speech perception abilities, language development in children in hard-of-hearing settings lags significantly behind. Speech perception, language and educational attainments of children in deaf education remained extremely poor. Furthermore more children in mainstream and hard-of-hearing environments are resilient than in deaf educational settings. Regression analyses showed an important influence of educational setting., CONCLUSIONS: Children with CI who are placed in early intervention environments that facilitate auditory development are able to achieve good auditory speech perception, language and educational levels on the long term.

	title = {Predictors of spoken language development following pediatric cochlear implantation.},
	volume = {33},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although deaf children with cochlear implants (CIs) are able to develop good language skills, the large variability in outcomes remains a significant concern. The first aim of this study was to evaluate language skills in children with CIs to establish benchmarks. The second aim was to make an estimation of the optimal age at implantation to provide maximal opportunities for the child to achieve good language skills afterward. The third aim was to gain more insight into the causes of variability to set recommendations for optimizing the rehabilitation process of prelingually deaf children with CIs., DESIGN: Receptive and expressive language development of 288 children who received CIs by age five was analyzed in a retrospective multicenter study. Outcome measures were language quotients (LQs) on the Reynell Developmental Language Scales and Schlichting Expressive Language Test at 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation. Independent predictive variables were nine child-related, environmental, and auditory factors. A series of multiple regression analyses determined the amount of variance in expressive and receptive language outcomes attributable to each predictor when controlling for the other variables., RESULTS: Simple linear regressions with age at first fitting and independent samples t tests demonstrated that children implanted before the age of two performed significantly better on all tests than children who were implanted at an older age. The mean LQ was 0.78 with an SD of 0.18. A child with an LQ lower than 0.60 (= 0.78-0.18) within 3 years after implantation was labeled as a weak performer compared with other deaf children implanted before the age of two. Contralateral stimulation with a second CI or a hearing aid and the absence of additional disabilities were related to better language outcomes. The effect of environmental factors, comprising multilingualism, parental involvement, and communication mode increased over time. Three years after implantation, the total multiple regression model accounted for 52\% of the variance in receptive language scores and 58\% of the variance in expressive language scores., CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of language test scores of this large group of children, an LQ of 0.60 or lower was considered a risk criterion for problematic language development compared with other deaf children using CIs. Children attaining LQs below 0.60 should be monitored more closely and perhaps their rehabilitation programs should be reconsidered. Improved language outcomes were related to implantation under the age of two, contralateral stimulation, monolingualism, sufficient involvement of the parents, and oral communication by the parents. The presence of an additional learning disability had a negative influence on language development. Understanding these causes of variation can help clinicians and parents to create the best possible circumstances for children with CIs to acquire language.},

A further question was how many children with migration background are bilingual., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review., SETTING: Tertiary referral center; cochlear implant program., PATIENTS: Ninety-three profoundly hearing-impaired children; 52 of these children reside in bilingual and 41 in monolingual homes., INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation before the age of 6 years, speech and language skills assessments., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standard speech perception and receptive and expressive language measures. Data on used primary and secondary languages were obtained by questionnaire., RESULTS: Children growing up in bilingual homes performed worse than children from monolingual homes in all performed speech tests. Almost all children with bilingual parents indicated German as their main language. In some cases, the second language is used actively, but in most children, the use is limited to single words and expressions. However, some children from bilingual homes achieve high skill level in German language and, furthermore, develop competency in second spoken language., CONCLUSION: Advanced language skills including the learning of a second spoken language are possible for children with cochlear implant living in bilingual homes, but that is the exception rather than the rule. It seems that other factors, such as spoken German language skills of the parents, integration of the family, and compliance with the rehabilitation program, play an important role. Therefore, a special support for children with cochlear implants from bilingual homes is needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Bilingual families with children with autism often struggle with the dilemma of language choice for their children as they are usually advised by professionals to use only one language to avoid the risk of language delay and confusion. However, there is no scientific base to such advice. Aim(s): To investigate how bilingualism would affect children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the aspect of executive functions (EF) and social and communication competence. Method \& Procedure: A total of 67 participants were separated into four groups according to their language use (bilingual/monolingual) and their developmental status (TD/ASD). Two-way ANOVA was used to analyze the accuracy and latency of EF tasks and the score of questionnaires on social and communication competence. Outcomes \& Results: Bilingual ASD children did not perform worse than monolingual ASD children. No significant differences were found between groups except between TD and ASD in the Japanese version of Stroop task and the scores of the social and communication competence questionnaires. Significant difference was found between the bilingual ASD and the Japanese monolingual ASD at the latency of the English version of Stroop task but stroop effect was not significantly different. Conclusions \& Implications: In addition to no extra delay in language development, this study suggests that being bilingual for children with ASD does not impede their EF and social and communication competence. Professionals should consider the family cultural background and language use before suggesting the 'one language only' advice as it can scar the family dynamics and deprive the child's opportunity to be fully involved in the family.Copyright Â© 2017 Japan Brain Science Society.

Word associations were assessed in 15 BLI and 9 MLI children. BLI were assessed in Arabic and Swedish, MLI in Swedish only. A number of syntagmatic (semantic link, different word class) and paradigmatic associations (semantic link, same word class) were calculated. Arabic and Swedish scores were compared with a conceptual score (total number of concepts from both languages). For BLI, the paradigmatic conceptual score was significantly higher than single language scores, confirming the distribution of lexical knowledge across languages. The BLI group had significantly higher conceptual paradigmatic scores than the MLI group. Conceptual scoring may reduce the over-identification of language impairment (LI) and underestimation of lexical knowledge in bilingual populations.Copyright Â© Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2015.},

The authors employed the following tasks: vSTM (non-word repetition and forward digit span), vWM (backward digit span), receptive vocabulary, syntactic production (sentence repetition) and syntactic comprehension (relative clauses, reflexives and passives). While the mono- and bi-DLD groups underperformed the mono- and bi-TD groups respectively in all tasks, the two clinical groups differed only in receptive vocabulary. vSTM was a significant predictor of syntactic performance for both monolinguals and bilinguals, while vWM was a significant predictor of syntactic performance only for bilinguals. These findings suggest that impairments in vSTM, wVM and syntax are core clinical features in DLD, and that vWM makes a greater contribution to syntax in bilinguals than in monolinguals.

	abstract = {The aim of the current study was two-fold. First, it evaluated the influence of bilingualism on syntactic abilities and verbal memory of children with High Functioning Autism (HFA). Second, it explored the relationship between syntactic abilities and verbal memory of children with HFA and typical language development (TLD). Eighty-six monolingual Hebrew-speaking and bilingual Russian-Hebrew speaking children aged 4;6-9;2 years participated: 28 with HFA (14 monolingual and 14 bilingual) and 58 with TLD (28 monolingual and 30 bilingual). Syntactic abilities were assessed using Sentence Repetition tasks (bilingual children were tested in both languages). Verbal memory was evaluated using Forward Digit Span for verbal short-term memory and Backward Digit Span for verbal working memory. As a group, children with HFA scored lower than their TLD peers on measures of syntactic abilities and verbal memory. However, some children with HFA, monolingual and bilingual, showed intact syntactic abilities, while others scored at-risk for Language Disorder (LD). Importantly, syntactic abilities in children with HFA were not associated with their verbal memory skills. Furthermore, no differences in verbal memory were found between children with HFA who were at-risk for LD and children with no risk. Bilingualism did not influence Sentence Repetition scores when vocabulary was controlled for, and it did not affect verbal memory scores. The study demonstrated that (1) syntactic difficulties in children with HFA are not attributable to deficient verbal memory; moreover (2), regardless of languages status, children with HFA at-risk for LD exhibit impaired syntax similarly to those reported in the literature for children with Developmental Language Disorder. Finally, the findings show that bilingualism affects children with TLD and HFA similarly, demonstrating that bilingualism does not impede language and cognitive development in children with HFA.

	abstract = {Complications from premature birth puts children at risk for poorer executive function compared to their term-born peers. This study aimed to examine the effect of bilingualism on the executive function of preterm-born children, a population that is thus far rarely addressed in the bilingualism literature. Executive function skills were assessed in 35 preterm-born children ages four to seven with the Simon and the Flanker task. All children were born before 35 weeks' gestation and were categorized as monolingual or bilingual and then matched on neonatal acuity. Bilingualism was operationalized as productive capacity in both Spanish and English and was confirmed by four triangulated measures. Results showed that the bilingual preterm-born children performed significantly better than the monolingual preterm-born children on the Flanker task. The bilingual group was also faster and more accurate on the Simon task, however group differences were not significant. Surprisingly, during the exit interview, 100 \% of the bilingual group parents reported that their child's pediatric primary care provider advised them to stop speaking Spanish at home. These preliminary findings indicate that (1) bilingualism may enhance executive function in preterm-born children and this is worth exploring further; and (2) clinical advice that parents abandon their home language and switch to English only with their preterm-born children is unwarranted.

One hundred and fifty children aged 5-7 were asked to narrate a story based on a series of pictures: 45 Hebrew monolinguals (19 with Developmental Language Disorders [DLD]), 57 English-Hebrew bilinguals (20 with DLD) and 48 Russian-Hebrew bilinguals (21 with DLD). The narratives told by bilingual children with Typical Language Development (TLD) were as complex as those of their monolingual peers in occurrence of causal relations to establish a goal-oriented episode, and in the use of language forms as cohesive devices. By contrast, bilingual and monolingual children with DLD showed lower performance on expression of causal relations, particularly those involving more complex scenes that demand higher levels of linguistic complexity and content elaboration. The form-function analyses enabled an exploration of cognitive and language abilities in interaction in the context of narrative discourse production. The study reinforced the differences between children with TLD and children with DLD, showing that typical language development rather than the proficiency in a particular language is necessary for generating causal relations and the particular linguistic forms that together yield a coherent narrative.

Their elicited productions were collected using a nonword repetition task (LITMUS-NWR-French), containing 71 nonwords with different syllable types. Except for typically-developing monolingual children, all children performed significantly better on branching onsets than on internal codas. Moreover, the repair strategies used in erroneous productions also indicate that children had more difficulties with internal codas: all the cases of metathesis affecting a target internal coda resulted in the production of a branching onset whereas the contrary was not observed. The differences in the rates of target-like production and the patterns of metathesis of these two structures suggest that internal codas are more difficult than branching onsets for children learning French.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Bilingual children are both over- and under-identified with developmental language disorder (DLD). We propose that this may be a function of monolingual approaches that fail to consider the dynamic nature of bilingualism as well as assumptions of bilingual delay. We explored the extent to which bilingual children with and without DLD demonstrated mixed dominance as a function of exposure to English. We document patterns of performance in bilingual children with and without DLD on the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment or Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment-Middle Extension in Spanish, English, and their best language scores., METHOD: A total of 595 (100 with DLD) Spanish-English bilingual children between the ages of 5 and 12 years were included in the analyses. We employed logistic regression to evaluate the probability of demonstrating mixed dominance across semantics and morphosyntax in Spanish and English by ability status. We then evaluated the association between English exposure and performance in Spanish, English, and the best language on semantics and morphosyntax measures., RESULTS: There were similar typically developing and DLD probabilities of Spanish or English dominance associated with high degrees of Spanish and English exposure. Mixed dominance was associated with both ability and exposure. Children with DLD demonstrated more mixed dominance from 0\% to 60\% English exposure. The patterns of mixed dominance were similar by ability when they had more than 60\% exposure to English. There were significant associations between single language testing in Spanish and English with percentage of exposure for children with and without DLD. When the best score (comparing English and Spanish) was used, there were no significant associations with exposure for semantics or morphosyntax., CONCLUSIONS: These results inform researchers and clinicians about the nature of bilingual proficiency in children with and without DLD. Mixed dominance was observed in both groups but with different patterns at lower levels of English exposure in children with and without DLD. We also see that when children's best score is considered, all differences in performance along the bilingual continuum are related to ability not language exposure. This has implications for how to consider children's language test scores in making clinical decisions about bilingual children. Presentation Video: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23929470.},

	abstract = {The present study examined disfluencies in the narratives of Russian-Hebrew bilingual children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) and Typical Language Development (TLD) in both Russian (home language) and Hebrew (societal language), with a focus on the independent and combined effects of language disorder and cross-linguistic differences on the rates and loci of disfluencies. Narratives were collected from 44 bilingual children (14 with DLD), ages 5;7-6;6, using a story retelling procedure. The narrative coding system targeted ratios of the following disfluencies (per C-unit): silent pauses, repetitions, self-corrections, and filled pauses. Silent pauses longer than 0.25 sec were identified using PRAAT softwareÂ© and were classified according to the following durations: more than 0.5 sec, 1 sec, 1.5 sec, and 2 sec. In addition, the loci of pauses (utterance-initial or utterance-internal) and repetitions (content or function words) were coded. Overall, children with DLD and TLD had comparable rates of disfluencies but differed for pauses longer than 0.5 sec and repetition of content words in both languages. For the overall ratio of pauses (more than 0.25 sec), children with and without DLD had more pauses in Russian. Long pauses and repetition of content words reflect difficulties for bilingual children with DLD in dealing with the demands of storytelling, in particular planning processes. A higher ratio of pauses in Russian suggests that they reflect lower proficiency in that language.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1125131},
	abstract = {Introduction: Mazes are linguistic disfluencies such as filled pauses, repetitions, or revisions of grammatical, phonological, or lexical aspects of words that do not contribute to the meaning of a sentence. Bilingual children are believed to increase the numbers of mazes in their native or heritage language, the minority language, as they become more proficient in the second language, the societal language. Mazes may increase over time in bilingual Spanish-speaking children as they become more proficient in English, the societal language in the United States. However, current studies have not been conducted longitudinally. Higher rates of mazes in the heritage language over time may be due to changes in language proficiency and differences in processing demands in the children as they use more complex language. Moreover, children with developmental language disorder (DLD) can also present higher rates of mazes than children with typical language. Heritage speakers, therefore, are at risk of being misdiagnosed with DLD due to high rates of mazes. Currently, we do not understand what the typical rates of mazes are as heritage speakers get older and become more proficient in the societal language. The current study examined the type and frequency of Spanish mazes longitudinally in a group of 22 Spanish heritage speakers with and without DLD and determined the changes over time., Methods: A total of 11 children with typical language development (TLD) and 11 with DLD participated in this 5-year longitudinal study. Using a wordless picture book, children completed a retelling task in Spanish during the spring of each academic year (PK to 3rd grade) as part of a 5-h testing battery. Narratives were transcribed and coded for types of mazes (filled pauses, repetitions, grammatical revisions, phonological revisions, and lexical revisions)., Results and conclusion: The results of the study indicate that TLD children increased their overall percentage of mazed words and utterances. The opposite pattern was observed in the DLD group, which decreased their percentage of mazed words and utterances. In contrast, both groups demonstrated a decrease in repetitions in first grade and an increase in third grade. Additionally, the TLD and DLD children decreased in the percentage of fillers in first grade and then increased in the third grade. Results suggest that maze use is quite variable in heritage speakers and does not necessarily differentiate groups. Clinicians should not rely solely on mazes to determine ability status. In fact, high use of mazes can reflect typical language development. Copyright Â© 2023 Martinez-Nieto, Moen, Pierce and Restrepo.},

Univariate analysis showed that primary language was associated with lower Bayley-III Language scores; however, multivariate analyses demonstrated that neither primary language nor language of administration were significantly associated with lower language scores when adjusted for gestational age, other developmental delays and sociodemographic factors, but multiple language exposure was. Sociodemographic and other factors are more important in determining language development than primary language at home.

The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM), administered several times poststroke, was used to evaluate cognition and linguistic development. Results: Similar cognitive outcomes were observed across language groups. However, an interaction effect with stroke-onset group was observed, with monolinguals in the first-year group having worse productive language outcomes as compared to bilinguals. Interpretation: Overall, no detrimental effects of bilingualism were found on children's poststroke cognition and linguistic development.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined the frequency, direction, and structural characteristics of code-switching (CS) during narratives by Spanish-English bilingual children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD) to determine whether children with DLD exhibit unique features in their CS that may inform clinical decision-making., METHOD: Spanish-English bilingual children, aged 4;0-6;11 (years;months), with DLD (n = 33) and with typical language development (TLD; n = 33) participated in narrative retell and story generation tasks in Spanish and English. Instances of CS were classified as between utterance or within utterance; within-utterance CS was coded for type of grammatical structure. Children completed the morphosyntax subtests of the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment to assist in identifying DLD and to index Spanish and English morphosyntactic proficiency., RESULTS: In analyses examining the contributions of both DLD status and Spanish and English proficiency, the only significant effect of DLD was on the tendency to engage in between-utterance CS; children with DLD were more likely than TLD peers to produce whole utterances in English during the Spanish narrative task. Within-utterance CS was related to lower morphosyntax scores in the target language, but there was no effect of DLD. Both groups exhibited noun insertions as the most frequent type of within-utterance CS. However, children with DLD tended to exhibit more determiner and verb insertions than TLD peers and increased use of "congruent lexicalization," that is, CS utterances that integrate content and function words from both languages., CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce that use of CS, particularly within-utterance CS, is a typical bilingual behavior even during narrative samples collected in a single-language context. However, language difficulties associated with DLD may emerge in how children code-switch, including use of between-utterance CS and unique patterns during within-utterance CS. Therefore, analyzing CS patterns may contribute to a more complete profile of children's dual-language skills during assessment., SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.23479574.},

However, the relative ease of semantic task completion depends on individual differences in developmental and language experience factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how language experience and language ability impact semantic task difficulty in English for school-age Spanish-English bilingual children with and without developmental language disorder (DLD)., METHOD: Participants included 232 Spanish-English bilingual children in second through fifth grade with (n = 35) and without (n = 197) DLD. Data included children's performance on the English Semantics subtest of the Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment-Middle Extension Field Test Version (BESA-ME), age of English acquisition, and percent English language exposure. Task difficulty, a measurement of the relative ease of task completion, was calculated for six semantic task types included on the BESA-ME. Multilevel regression modeling was conducted to estimate longitudinal growth trajectories for each semantic task type., RESULTS: Results showed that language ability and grade level drive semantic task difficulty for all task types, and children with DLD experienced greater difficulty on all task types compared to their typically developing peers. Longitudinally, semantic task difficulty decreased for all children, regardless of language ability, indicating that semantic task types became easier over time. While children made gains on all semantic tasks, the growth rate of task difficulty was not equal across task types, where some task types showed slower growth compared with others. English language exposure emerged as a significant predictor of semantic task difficulty while age of acquisition was not a significant factor., CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies developmental profiles of lexical-semantic performance in bilingual children with and without DLD and supports clinical decision-making regarding children's English language learning.},

	doi = {10.1111/1460-6984.12821},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early and effective treatment for children with developmental language disorder (DLD) is important. Although a growing body of research shows the effects of interventions at the group level, clinicians observe large individual differences in language growth, and differences in outcomes across language domains. A systematic understanding of how child characteristics contribute to changes in language skills is still lacking., AIMS: To assess changes in the language domains: expressive morphosyntax; receptive and expressive vocabulary; and comprehension, in children in special needs education for DLD. To explore if differences in language gains between children are related to child characteristics: language profile; severity of the disorder; being raised mono- or multilingually; and cognitive ability., METHODS \& PROCEDURES: We extracted data from school records of 154 children (4-6 years old) in special needs education offering a language and communication-stimulating educational environment, including speech and language therapy. Changes in language were measured by comparing the scores on standardized language tests at the beginning and the end of a school year. Next, we related language change to language profile (receptive-expressive versus expressive-only disorders), severity (initial scores), growing up mono- and multilingually, and children's reported non-verbal IQ scores., OUTCOMES \& RESULTS: Overall, the children showed significant improvements in expressive morphosyntax, expressive vocabulary and language comprehension. Baseline scores and gains were lowest for expressive morphosyntax. Differences in language gains between children with receptive-expressive disorders and expressive-only disorders were not significant. There was more improvement in children with lower initial scores. There were no differences between mono- and multilingual children, except for expressive vocabulary. There was no evidence of a relation between non-verbal IQ scores and language growth., CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: Children with DLD in special needs education showed gains in language performance during one school year. There was, however, little change in morphosyntactic scores, which supports previous studies concluding that poor morphosyntax is a persistent characteristic of DLD. Our results indicate that it is important to include all children with DLD in intervention: children with receptive-expressive and expressive disorders; mono- and multilingual children, and children with high, average and low non-verbal IQ scores. We did not find negative relations between these child factors and changes in language skills., WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Intervention studies indicate that intervention can be effective, but not for all children with DLD, and not in all language domains. Longitudinal studies on language development show stable growth patterns in children with DLD at the group level. A systematic understanding of how child characteristics contribute to changes in language skills is still lacking. What this paper adds to existing knowledge In this study, we report on the language gains of a cohort of 154 children with DLD (4-6 years old), in a special education setting for children with language disorders. Our sample includes children with receptive-expressive disorders and expressive-only disorders, and monolingual as well as multilingual children. Our results show that children's language skills improved. The co-normed tests we used revealed that the children had much lower growth in morphosyntax than in the other language domains. Language gains between children with receptive-expressive and expressive-only language disorders did not differ, children with lower initial test scores showed more improvement than children with higher initial scores, multilingual children showed more gains in expressive vocabulary than monolingual children, and there was no effect of non-verbal IQ on change in language scores. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The results suggest that catching up on language is possible for children with DLD. It is important to include all children with DLD in intervention: mono- and multilingual children; children with receptive-expressive and expressive disorders; and children with high, average and low non-verbal IQ scores. We did not find negative relations between these child factors and changes in language skills. The limited growth in morphosyntax compared with other linguistic areas warrants the attention of both practitioners and researchers, with a particular focus on the implementation of research findings in clinical practice.

	abstract = {Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show heterogeneous language profiles beyond early language delays. Understanding the second language profiles of bilingual children with ASD is important for clinical practice in diverse societies. Accordingly, we examined the narrative abilities of bilinguals with ASD, with developmental language disorder (DLD), and with typical development (TD) to determine which narrative components best differentiate bilinguals with ASD from the other groups. Participants were 29 bilingual children with ASD, DLD, and TD who were matched for age (mean = 6;8), nonverbal intelligence, and receptive vocabulary. Narratives were coded for macrostructure (story grammar (SG) scores, number of individual SG components) and microstructure (syntactic complexity, mean length of utterance, lexical diversity, and story length). The TD group had superior SG scores, included more SG components, and used longer utterances and more complex syntax than the ASD group, whereas no differences were found between the clinical groups. For SG components requiring perspective-taking abilities, the ASD group had worse performance than the TD and DLD groups. Our results suggest that bilingual children with ASD show weaknesses in both macrostructure and microstructure, which can overlap with children with DLD. The linguistic profiles of bilingual children with ASD and DLD are thus both overlapping and distinct. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, limited information pertaining to expressive vocabulary development exists for school-aged bilinguals-particularly those with developmental language disorder (DLD). Cross-linguistic differences in the semantic characteristics of words may impact the types of cues available for constructing expressive vocabulary knowledge. To address this gap, we evaluated the relationships between intrinsic factors (age, language ability), extrinsic factors (L1 exposure), and word characteristics (e.g. imageability, concreteness) with item difficulty and expressive vocabulary knowledge in school-aged Spanish-English bilinguals with and without DLD. While we found similar patterns of associations between item difficulty and word characteristics across language ability groups, divergent predictive patterns emerged across languages and across ability groups. Educators supporting the development of bilingual students' expressive vocabulary knowledge must account for not only cultural differences across students, but also characteristics inherent to words.

	abstract = {Bilingual children are becoming a majority worldwide, and this is true both for neurotypical children, children with Developmental Language Disorders (DLD), and children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who are at the center of PrÃ©vost and Tullerâs (henceforth P\&T) article. In bilingual development, we consider the impact of bilingual exposure variables on the development of each language. We further explore crosslinguistic influence, that is, the influence of the two languages on each other and how the same bilingual exposure variables impact crosslinguistic influence. For neurotypical children, bilingual variables such as age of onset of bilingualism (AOB) and length of exposure (LOE) were found to have a major impact on linguistic outcomes in both languages (for an overview see Armon-Lotem \& Meir, 2019; Unsworth, 2014). Yet, as pointed out by P\&T, less is known for bilingual children with DLD and even less for children with ASD. This is of a special interest as we can only measure the exposure but not the intake, that is, not what children do with the input they receive. The cases mentioned in P \& T of learning a second language in the absence of communication, on the one hand, and of Arabic speaking children with ASD using the standard rather than the spoken variety, further highlight this dissociation between input and intake, and eventually output. We address this challenge, and bring evidence for the differential impact of exposure for children with DLD and ASD when compared with what we know for neurotypical children. And as is expected for bilingual children, we shall address both languages to see if different patterns are observed for each language.},

The procedure saves patientsâ lives, as blood cannot be manufactured artificially and can only be obtained from human blood sources. Aims: To assess the awareness of, perceptions of, motivations regarding, and barriers to blood donation among a sample of Jazan University students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Settings and Design: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Jazan University. Materials and Methods: Stratified random sampling was used to collect information from 440 students, and a predesigned, structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the study variables. Statistical Analysis: Involved descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. SPSS was used for data analysis. Results: The prevalence of blood donation was 29.0\% (95\% CI, 25.0â33.3), significantly higher for males at 44.3\% (95\% CI, 38.3â50.4) than for females at 10.5\% (95\% CI, 7.3â16.0; P Conclusions: The prevalence of blood donation was found to be low, and studentsâ knowledge regarding blood donation appeared to be lacking.

	abstract = {Background
As bone marrow transplantation (BMT) increases, the availability of suitable donors becomes critical, especially for African Americans, who require a large donor pool to find a suitable match. Previous studies indicated willingness to donate marrow may be a barrier for achieving a large donor pool.
Methods
We conducted a random-sample, statewide telephone survey of 421 Caucasians and 408 African Americans in South Carolina to determine if racial differences in willingness to donate bone marrow exist. We assessed a general level of willingness, asking, âWill you be willing to be a marrow donor?â We assessed an additional level of willingness, asking, âAre you willing to be contacted about bone marrow donation?â
Results
We detected no racial differences in general willingness to donate (Caucasians 34\%, African Americans 32\%, P = .52), although there was a difference in willingness to be contacted to sign-up for the registry (Caucasians 18.3\%, African Americans 11\%, P = .003). African Americans were more aware that better matches occur within the same race (P {\textless} .0001). Caucasians were more knowledgeable about the registry (P {\textless} .0001). Younger, more highly educated respondents indicated a greater willingness to be donors. In both races, fear of pain was the most common reason for unwillingness to donate, and it was significantly higher in African Americans.
Conclusion
Our study suggests reported lack of general willingness does not explain the racial disparities in BMT. Many who expressed willingness to donate were not willing to be contacted to sign up for the registry, especially African Americans. Education and adequate pain control may improve minority recruitment.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Health advocacy is an important skill for healthcare professionals to develop, but is challenging to teach. Here, we describe the development \& evaluation of a curriculum to support healthcare professionals \& trainees to develop as health advocates through advancing health equity across donation products for marginalized groups. Methods: We developed a transfusion medicine health equity \& advocacy curriculum âAdvancing a more inclusive blood and transplant system for marginalized groupsâ. This curriculum included two workshops focusing on advancing inclusion across donation products for 1) LGBTQIA+ \& 2) racialized peoples. The first workshop, âBuilding a more inclusive blood and transplant system for LGBTQIA+ peoplesâ outlined blood, stem cell, \& organ \& tissue donation in Canada for gay, bisexual, \& other men who have sex with men, starting from the historical policies \& the context in which they were first put in place, to today's policies \& where future policies may lie. The second workshop, âAddressing racial disparities in blood, stem cell, and organ \& tissue donor poolsâ, outlined disparities in donor pools across donation products, barriers to donation impacting racialized/ ethnic populations, \& structural racism in donation policies (i.e. policies which disproportionately impact racialized/ ethnic peoples). The workshops also presented content from national campaigns to engage LGBTQIA+ peoples (stemcellclub.ca/SavingLivesWithPride) \& Black peoples (stemcellclub.ca/BlackDonorsSaveLives) to donation (Figure 1). Both workshops concluded with facilitated discussion groups supporting participants to reflect on donation policies for marginalized groups \& their consequences, \& how to help overcome barriers to donation. The curriculum was published to stemcellclub.ca/training \& piloted with a national cohort of Canadian medical students. Quantitative \& qualitative analyses (using a thematic analysis approach) were conducted to evaluate participants' perspectives on the impact of the workshop on their development as health advocates. Results: We hosted these workshops at 9 medical schools across Canada 10/2020-3/2023. 142 medical students participated, of whom 103/142 completed pre- \& post- workshop surveys (73\% response rate). 64/103 (62\%) of survey respondents were female, 47/103 (46\%) identified as racialized or LGBTQIA+, \& 86/103 (83\%) were pre-clerkship with 17/103 (17\%) in clerkship. Results from quantitative \& qualitative analyses of participants' perspectives on the role of these workshops in their development as health advocates are shown in Table 1A-B. Nearly all participants strongly agreed/ agreed the workshops supported their development as health advocates (101/103, 98\%), including the abilities to: advocate for patients beyond the clinical environment; work with patients/ communities to address \& identify determinants of health that affect them; respond to the needs of communities/ populations by advocating with them for system-level change; apply a process of continuous quality improvement to health promotion activities; \& contribute to a process to improve the health of a community/ population they will serve. Nearly all felt that the workshop should be incorporated into medical curricula (99/103, 96\%). Following each workshop, a subset of medical students (n = 38 for each) participated in focus groups to share their perspectives on what they learned. Qualitative analysis identified rich examples of participants' development as health advocates through their participation in the workshops, across the following themes: prioritize inclusion; recognize discrimination; understand barriers to change; collaborate with advocates from diverse communities to address disparities; \& build a culture which supports inclusion. Conclusion: We present the first-ever curriculum in health equity in transfusion medicine to our knowledge, focusing on advancing inclusion across donation products \& addressing disparities impacting patients \& donors from marginalized groups. We also share the perspective of a national cohort of medical students in Canada that their participation in this curriculum contributed to their development as health advocates. This workshop is a model for teaching health advocacy to healthcare professionals \& trainees, and is relevant to a wide audience across medicine.},

This study investigated the level of and the influence of socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy on the intention to donate HSC among blood donors. Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited blood donors at selected public hospitals in the Malaysian State of Sarawak in 2019. A structured questionnaire was developed based on the review of relevant literature. It gathered information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy on the intention to donate HSC. Variables with a p value \&lt;0.200 in bivariate analysis were included in the variable selection for regression modeling to examine their associations with the intention to donate HSC. Results: A total of 569 blood donors participated (94.5\% response rate). Overall, 87.1\% reported a positive intention to donate HSC. In the regression model, the factor with the greatest association with intention to donate HSC was subjective norms about HSC donation (Î² = 0.35, 95\% CI 0.27â0.42), followed by attitude about regulations of HSC donation (Î²= 0.21, 95\% CI 0.13â0.35), self-efficacy on HSC donation (Î² = 0.15, 95\% CI 0.09â0.32), attitude about the potential side effects of HSC donation (Î² = 0.14, 95\% CI 0.02â0.10) and highest education level (Î² = 0.10, 95\% CI 0.03â0.44). Conclusions: The findings can be used to formulate a better strategy in promoting HSC donation among blood donors in the region.},

	abstract = {BackgroundÂ 
          Minority blood donations have historically been low in the United States; however, increasing the proportion of minority blood donations is essential to reducing blood transfusion complicationsâparticularly in African Americans with sickle cell disease and thalassemia.
          ObjectivesÂ 
          The research question was as follows: What are the facilitators and barriers to blood donation in minority populations?
          MethodsÂ 
          Beginning August 2017, we conducted a literature search using the following electronic databases: CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Academic Search Complete, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Collection, Cochrane Library, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses, and PubMed, which continued through December 2017. Based on primarily descriptive data in the articles (n = 15), the systematic review proceeded as a meta-synthesis. An inductive approach was used to analyze commonalities, differences, patterns, and themes in the study findings; interpret the findings; and synthesize the findings to generate new knowledge about the phenomena of study.
          ResultsÂ 
          The themes included (a) knowing a blood recipient; (b) identifying with culture, race/ethnicity, and religious affiliation; and (c) medical mistrust and misunderstanding. All were prominent in the descriptions of minorities on blood donation and exist as facilitators and barriers.
          DiscussionÂ 
          The reviewed studies demonstrated that facilitators and barriers to minority blood donations are complex and exist concurrently. Community education and communication about blood donation have a positive effect on fellow community members, including friends and family, in racial and ethnic minorities that are underrepresented among blood donors. Findings further suggest the need to rebuild trust among minority communities.},

	abstract = {BackgroundHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become increasingly common for treatment of severe hematological disorders. However, the number of compatible hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors is usually limited. Expanding donor pool size would enhance matching success by increasing donor frequency and introducing allelic diversity within the registry. Identifying factors that affect public willingness towards HSC donation allows better strategic recruitment planning to facilitate donor pool expansion. Previous studies in white populations showed knowledge, family attitude, trust towards the healthcare system, fear, self-identity, and social identity are important factors related to HSC donation intention. However, given the differences in cultural and society values that exist across different regions, in particular between the East and West, whether these factors influence HSC donation willingness in Hong Kong remained to be determined. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HSC donation motivation in Hong Kong.Material and methodsA large-scale, cross-sectional, observational study involving 3479 local participants.ResultsThere is a positive correlation of HSC donation intention with younger age (18-32, OR: 1.80, pâ¤0Â·001) and higher education (OR: 1Â·47, pâ¤0.001). Better HSCT knowledge is also related to greater HSC donation intention (OR: 2.55, pÂ£0.001).ConclusionsOur data suggests HSCT education could help to improve donor recruitment and that more resources should be allocated for public education.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Understanding changes in the demand and usage of unrelated allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) donors during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to optimize pandemic preparedness of registry and donor collection services. The aim of this study was to understand the extent to which the pandemic has impacted the demand and usage of unrelated donors and cord blood units (CBUs) at Canadian Blood Services (CBS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data regarding stem cell donor interest and product usage for unrelated allogeneic HCT were retrieved from the database at CBS using de-identified anonymous information.
RESULTS: Unrelated donor searches for Canadian patients remained unchanged by the pandemic, reflecting stable demand. The number of unrelated allogeneic transplants performed within Canada also remained stable, while the number of cord blood transplants increased, chiefly for paediatric patients. Requests for donor verification typing, a first signal of potential interest, increased from domestic centres during the first 6Â months of the pandemic and decreased from international centres, before returning to baseline levels. The proportion of transplants for Canadian patients who used stem cell products procured from Canadian donors increased between 3 and 6Â months after the start of the pandemic before returning to baseline and appears to be increasing again more than 1Â year after the start of the pandemic. Use of CBUs for Canadian paediatric patients increased and remains elevated.
CONCLUSION: Demand for unrelated adult HCT donors has remained stable despite the evolving pandemic with a transient and recurring increased interest and usage of domestic adult donors. Use of CBUs for paediatric patients has increased and remains elevated. Registries and donor collection centres should maintain the capacity to expand services for domestic donor collection during pandemics to offset threats to international donor usage.},

We propose that the two Canadian blood suppliers, HÃ©ma-QuÃ©bec and Canadian Blood Services, expand their role in public health surveillance in the post-pandemic period. Together blood suppliers have near-national reach, collecting blood donations nearly every day in all larger cities and many smaller municipalities. Blood donors are a healthy subset of the general population. Demographic data, routine infectious disease testing and screening questionnaire data are collected for all donations. Close to one million blood samples per year could be made available for surveillance. With 90\% repeat donors, longitudinal sampling is possible. Current blood donor surveillance includes monitoring infectious marker rates in low risk (e.g. HIV, hepatitis C virus) or asymptomatic (e.g. West Nile virus) populations, and ad hoc studies to monitor transfusion-transmissible infections. These include tick-borne infections such as Babesia microti and foodborne infections such as hepatitis E. Canadian Blood Services and HÃ©ma-QuÃ©bec are actively seeking to engage with public health professionals to further develop a role in public health surveillance.},

	abstract = {A population survey of awareness and attitudes regarding a bone-marrow bank was carried out in 19 cities and towns of Shiga prefecture in July 1991, to identify factors that would promote donor self-registration among the general population. The survey involved 832 residents (416 men and 416 women) selected as follows: Each social welfare commissioner of the cities and towns selected a total of eight residents, one male and one female from each of 4 age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years old). The questionnaires were distributed and collected by the social welfare commissioners with an overall response rate of 97.4\%. Subjects answered questions regarding their experience and desire to participate in social volunteer activities, knowledge about bone-marrow banks, their perception of it's necessity, and whether they would participate in a bone-marrow bank, etc. A total of 25.9\% of male and 20.6\% of female subjects stated they had a desire to register in a bone-marrow bank. From the result of multiple regression analysis, the characteristics of those who showed interest in registration in a bone-marrow bank included having heard of the bone-marrow bank, experience in social volunteer activity, experience in blood donation, knowledge of bone-marrow transplantation and living in a town where need for establishment of a bone-marrow bank was widely discussed among residents. In the promotion of the idea of a bone-marrow bank, the role of motivating people to participate in voluntary blood donation and other social volunteer activities appears to be important.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment for patients with blood disorders and genetic diseases. Approximately 70\% of the HSCTs currently performed in the United States use stems cells from an unrelated donor who donated voluntarily. Medical students (MS) are a young, diverse, influential population whose willingness to engage in altruistic acts, such as donating stem cells, may be correlated with knowledge on the topic. A literature gap exists in MS perspectives towards HSCT and the bone marrow registry (BMR) and prior studies suggest that misconceptions about donation deter MS from participation on the BMR, which may decrease opportunities to educate other potential donors. We performed a cross-sectional survey among the 4-year cohort of MS at Mayo Medical School in Rochester, Minnesota. The questionnaire evaluated multiple areas including whether MS were current members of the BMR and/or prior blood donors, MS current knowledge on donor eligibility (DE) and the donation process (DP), MS familiarity with HSCT and the DP, and MS attitudes towards joining the BMR and towards donating stem cells. The responses were analyzed and assessed alongside a self-reported, standardized scale measuring students' altruistic behaviors. There were 99 out of 247 potential respondents (40\%), with 45\% (nâ=â44) of MS in preclinical years 1 or 2, 37\% (nâ=â37) in clinical years 3 or 4, and 18\% (nâ=â18) in research or alternative portions of their training, of which 43\% (nâ=â41) in total were current BMR members. BMR status correlated positively with prior blood donation (Pâ=â.015) and female sex (Pâ=â.014). Respondents had a 57.7\% and 63.7\% average correct response rate regarding knowledge of DE and DP, respectively, with knowledge of DE not surprisingly higher in BMR members (Pâ{\textless}â.0001). The majority of MS surveyed, 68\% (nâ=â65), had learned about HSCT during medical school. BMR status correlated with the following attitudes towards donating stem cells: lower concern with all evaluated aspects of HSCTâtime, cost, pain, and side effects (for all subsections, Pâ{\textless}â.05) but not with the altruism score (Pâ=â.32). The mean altruism score for respondents was 59.9âÂ±â11.3 (of a possible 100 points) with no significant difference in age, race, sex, level of training, or participation in the BMR. Altruism scores did not directly correlate with lower concern with aspects of time, cost, and pain of HSCT but did with long-term side effects (Pâ=â.021). This latter correlation was regardless of BMR status. Among MS, positive predictors for participation in the BMR included prior blood donation and female sex. BMR status did not ensure knowledge of all aspects of donating stem cells, but it correlated with less concern regarding the DP and was unrelated to altruism score. Improving knowledge gaps regarding the BMR and HSCT for the next generation of physicians and health care providers through expanded medical education curriculum may be beneficial to for the recruitment and retention of donor populations to the BMR.},

	abstract = {Hemopoietic stem cells can be used from bone marrow or blood or umbilical cord blood of matched siblings or appropriately matched unrelated volunteers. Today, large bone marrow registries have been established to help identify volunteer unrelated bone marrow donors for patients lacking a family donor. Despite there being almost 10 million registered potential bone marrow donors (PBMD) worldwide, only 50\% of white patients have a suitable bone marrow match. Growth in the number of PBMD increases the likelihood of finding a compatible donor for a patient. The attitudes and knowledge of 250 registered PBMD and 315 not registered PBMD toward bone marrow donation, tissues and organs donation, and blood donation were surveyed, using a questionnaire with 27 items. Multivariate logistic regression identified gender (females more often than males), regular blood donation, having a relative or a friend who has already been registered as PBMD, having a relative or a friend who needs bone marrow transplantation, family discussion about tissue and organ donation, knowledge about bone marrow transplantation, information about bone marrow transplantation, and trust in health professionals were independent predictive factors influencing people's decision to register as PBMD. Knowledge of these factors is important to target recruitment efforts.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationships among altruistic health acts may serve to aid therapeutic research advances. In this paper, we report on the links between two such behavioursâdonating blood and carrying an organ donor cardâand willingness to donate urological tissue to a tissue bank. Reasons for the differential willingness to do so are examined in this paper. A systematic sample of 259 new and returning attendees at a tertiary urology referral clinic in Ireland completed a self-report questionnaire in an outpatient setting. In addition to demographic details, details of known diagnosis of malignancy and family history of cancer; attitudes to tissue donation for research purposes were gauged using a 5-point Likert scale. Both blood donors and organ donor card carriers were more likely to be willing to donate tissue for research purposes. Blood donors were more likely want to know their overall results in comparison to nonblood donors and want their samples to be used for nonprofit research. Our hypothesis that being a blood donor would be a better predictor to donate urological tissue than being an organ donor card carrier borne out by the trends reported above.},

	abstract = {No two bilinguals are the same. Differences in bilingual experiences can affect language-related processes but have also been proposed to modulate executive functioning. Recently, there has been an increased interest in studying individual differences between bilinguals, for example in terms of their age of acquisition, language proficiency, use, and switching. However, and despite the importance of this individual variation, studies often do not provide detailed assessments of their bilingual participants. This review first discusses several aspects of bilingualism that have been studied in relation to executive functioning. Next, I review different questionnaires and objective measurements that have been proposed to better define bilingual experiences. In order to better understand (effects of) bilingualism within and across studies, it is crucial to carefully examine and describe not only a bilingualâs proficiency and age of acquisition, but also their language use and switching as well as the different interactional contexts in which they use their languages.},

	abstract = {As the number of bilinguals in the USA grows rapidly, it is increasingly important for neuropsychologists to be equipped and trained to address the unique challenges inherent in conducting ethical and competent neuropsychological evaluations with this population. Research on bilingualism has focused on two key cognitive mechanisms that introduce differences between bilinguals and monolinguals: (a) reduced frequency of language-specific use (weaker links), and (b) competition for selection within the language system in bilinguals (interference). Both mechanisms are needed to explain how bilingualism affects neuropsychological test performance, including the robust bilingual disadvantages found on verbal tasks, and more subtle bilingual advantages on some measures of cognitive control. These empirical results and theoretical claims can be used to derive a theoretically informed method for assessing cognitive status in bilinguals. We present specific considerations for measuring degree of bilingualism for both clients and examiners to aid in determinations of approaches to testing bilinguals, with practical guidelines for incorporating models of bilingualism and recent experimental data into neuropsychological evaluations. This integrated approach promises to provide improved clinical services for bilingual clients, and will also contribute to a program of research that will ultimately reveal the mechanisms underlying language processing and executive functioning in bilinguals and monolinguals alike.},
